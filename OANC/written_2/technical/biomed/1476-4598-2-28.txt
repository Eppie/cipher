        The normal function of transforming growth factor β 
        1 (TGFβ 
        1 ) is essential for the entire
        organism, representing a multifunctional regulator of cell
        growth and differentiation [ 1 2 3 4 5 ] . TGFβ 
        1 is a potent inhibitor of epithelial
        cell proliferation. Upon binding of TGFβ 
        1 , TGFβ 
        1 -receptors phosphorylate SMAD2 or
        SMAD3 [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ] . Phosphorylated SMAD2/3
        associates with SMAD4 and, as a complex, moves into the
        nucleus, where it regulates gene expression [ 13 14 15 ]
        .
        SMAD4 (DPC4) is essential for this TGFβ 
        1 signaling and transcriptional
        activation process [ 16 ] . In epithelial cells, TGFβ 
        1 decreases c-myc, cdc2 and cyclin D1
        expression, and it increases the expression of c-jun and
        c-fos [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 ] . Activation of the TGFβ 
        1 signal pathway in epithelial cells
        leads to an increased expression of the cell cycle
        inhibitors p21 WAF1and p15 Ink4band to a release of
        formerly sequestered p27 KIP [ 24 25 26 ] . It is assumed
        that the cooperative action of these cell cycle inhibitors
        results in the growth arrest mentioned above, although p15
        Ink4bdoes not seem to be necessary in this regard. In
        addition to mutations in the TGFβ 
        1 -receptors, in a large number of
        carcinomas disruptions of this signaling pathway by the
        alteration of a single protein such as p15 Ink4b, p16, and
        p21 Waf1are found [ 2 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38
        39 ] . This may result in resistance to the
        growth-inhibiting action of TGFβ 
        1 .
        In several cell lines, particularly in pancreatic
        carcinoma cells, resistance to TGFβ 
        1 could be attributed to a loss of
        function of the SMAD4 (DPC4) protein [ 40 41 42 43 ] .
        However, the pancreatic carcinoma cell line BxPC-3,
        although homozygously deleted for SMAD4, is growth
        inhibited by TGFβ 
        1 [ 30 44 ] . It is thus speculated that
        alternative signaling pathways in addition to the SMAD
        pathway may exist.
        After binding to α 
        V β 
        6 integrin, latent TGFβ 
        1 is activated by processing of latent
        TGFβ 
        1 by cleavage of the latency-associated
        Peptide (LAP) [ 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 ] .
        Recently, the interaction of latent TGFβ 
        1 with α 
        V β 
        6 integrin has been shown [ 45 ] . After
        binding of latent TGFβ 
        1 to α 
        V β 
        6 integrin, latent TGFβ 
        1 is activated by cleavage of the
        latency-associated peptide (LAP) [ 45 ] . This α 
        V β 
        6 integrin is also expressed by
        pancreatic carcinoma cells [ 58 59 60 61 62 63 ] . We
        hypothesized that there is a SMAD-independent TGFβ 
        1 signaling pathway in TGFβ 
        1 -sensitive carcinoma cells. To address
        this question, several carcinoma cell lines with different
        degrees of TGFβ 
        1 sensitivity were chosen as a model
        system. We investigated the interaction of TGFβ 
        1 with the α 
        V β 
        6 integrin and its influence on selected
        target genes known to be involved in cell cycle-regulated
        growth inhibition. Here, we demonstrate an alternate TGFβ 
        1 signaling pathway via α 
        V β 
        6 integrin contributing to TGFβ 
        1 growth inhibiton in TGFβ 
        1 sensitive carcinoma cells.
      
      
        Results
        
          Mature TGFβ 1induces cytoskeletal immobilization of
          proteins and tyrosine phosphorylation via integrin α Vβ
          6only in TGFβ 1sensitive cells
          Only integrins that have bound their ligands are
          anchored to the cytoskeleton [ 64 65 ] . In our
          experiments, mature TGFβ 
          1 , α 
          V β 
          6 integrin, and F-actin colocalize
          (Figure 1), suggesting association with and activation of
          this integrin. To further support this finding, we
          stimulated cells and performed co-immunoprecipitated
          various integrin subunits of cytoskeletal anchored
          proteins [ 66 67 ] (additional file 1, 2, 3and 4). Our
          data strongly suggest that mature TGFβ 
          1 associates with α 
          V β 
          6 integrin (additional file 1, 2, 3and
          4).

          To determine whether binding of mature TGFβ 
          1 leads to integrin-mediated
          signaling, we looked at the status of
          integrin-cytoskeleton-associated proteins [ 66 67 ] after
          incubation with mature TGFβ 
          1 in selected carcinoma cell lines
          with different degrees of sensitivity to TGFβ 
          1 (Table 1). Cytoskeletal anchored
          proteins were precipitated with anti α 
          V and β 
          6 -antibodies. Immobilization of
          proteins to the cytoskeleton (Triton-X insoluble
          fraction, Figure 2B) as well as tyrosine phosphorylation
          of these proteins (Figure 2A) induced through mature TGFβ
          
          1 was only seen in the TGFβ 
          1 -sensitive carcinoma cell lines
          (Figure 2and additional file 5). Notably, tyrosine
          phosphorylation of cytoskeletally anchored proteins is
          further enhanced after combined treatment with mature
          TGFβ 
          1 and fibronectin in TGFβ 
          1 sensitive cells (Figure 3). In
          contrast, in the TGFβ 
          1 -resistant AsPC-1 and Capan-1 cells,
          the interaction of mature TGFβ 
          1 with α 
          V β 
          6 integrin resulted in an
          immobilization of high molecular weight proteins to the
          cytoskeleton without tyrosine phosphorylation (Figure 2).
          Again, stimulation of TGFβ 
          1 sensitive cells BxPC-3, LoVo [ 68 ]
          , SW48 [ 68 ] , Keratinocytes, HeLa and DLD1 [ 69 ] ,
          results in an enhanced cytoskeletal immobilization and
          tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in response
          to stimulation with mature TGFβ 
          1 (additional file 5). Remarkably,
          preincubation with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 resulted in
          a reduced cytoskeletal immobilization and tyrosine
          phosphorylation of cellular proteins in response to
          stimulation with mature TGFβ 
          1 . This finding is in agreement with
          other observations that MEK1-mediated signal transduction
          is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and integrin
          engagement [ 70 71 ] .

          V β 
          6 was immunoprecipitated after TGFβ 
          1 stimulation (10 nM for 10 minutes)
          followed by Western analysis with antibodies against
          tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (A) or Western blotting
          after biotinylation of all proteins and streptavidin
          detection (B). In part the cells were preincubated with α
          
          V - and β 
          6 -antibodies (1:100 each for 30 min)
          or with a TGFβ-RII antibody (15 μg/ml for 30 min).

          Activation of p125 FAK, a central step in
          integrin-associated signaling [ 72 73 ] , was determined
          to assess integrin-mediated signaling. BcPC-3 cells are
          sensitive to TGFβ 
          1 but are SMAD4 deleted. We incubated
          BxPC-3 cells with mature TGFβ 
          1 and observed an association on the
          cytoskeleton connected with integrin α 
          V β 
          6 and activation of p125 FAK(Figure
          4). Indeed, TGFβ 
          1 antibodies, cytochalasin D and
          BAPTA-AM [ 66 ] abolished the association on the
          cytoskeleton connected with integrin α 
          V β 
          6 and activation of p125 FAK. These
          data further suggest that TGFβ 
          1 mediated activation of p125
          FAKdepends on free intracellular calcium and an intact
          actin cytoskeleton.
          In order to test whether TGFβ 
          1 signaling via α 
          V β 
          6 is specific for SMAD4 deleted BxPC-3
          cells or if this is a general phenomenon, we investigated
          signaling in TGFβ 
          1 -sensitive carcinoma cell lines
          HeLa, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. TGFβ 
          1 induced recruitment of p125 Fak,
          p130 Casand Sos1/2 to the cytoskeleton. Enhanced
          expression of c-jun, c-fos, p21 WAF1and p27 KIP, while
          downregulating PCNA, is dependent on ERK1/2 signaling, an
          intact cytoskeleton and intracellular calcium (Figures 5,
          6A, 7, 8and additional files 6, 7and 8). We also
          confirmed the purity of the commercially available mature
          TGFβ 
          1 used in these experiments by silver
          stained non-reducing SDS-PAGE, with latent TGFβ 
          1 as control (Figure 6B). We also
          demonstrated the SMAD4 deficiency of the BxPC-3 cells
          used (Figure 6C).

          TGFβ 1/α Vβ 6integrin signaling is independent of
          the known TGFβ 1signaling pathway
          To explain the TGFβ 
          1 sensitivity of SMAD4-deleted cells,
          it is speculated that after binding of TGFβ 
          1 to its receptor, activated SMAD2/3
          may translocate to the nucleus and activate gene
          expression even in the absence of SMAD4. To exclude this
          possibility, cellular proteins were divided into
          cytoplasmatic and nuclear fractions after TGFβ 
          1 stimulation, and localization and
          phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 were investigated. In the
          SMAD4 deleted BxPC-3 cells, TGFβ 
          1 resulted in phosphorylation of
          SMAD2/3, but the activated SMAD proteins were retained in
          the cytoplasmatic fraction (Figure 9). Remarkably, in
          NP-9 cells [ 74 ] , SMAD2/3 are translocated into the
          nucleus upon TGFβ 
          1 stimulation (additional file 9(A))
          but we could not observe an enhanced tyrosine
          phosphorylation of cytoskeletal anchored proteins
          (additional file 9(B)).

          TGFβ 1mediated growth inhibition is dependent on α
          Vβ 6integrin
          Influence of TGFβ 
          1 on cell growth is well established,
          but the mechanisms are not fully understood [ 75 76 77 78
          79 ] . Here, we assayed for the possible synergistic
          function of α 
          V β 
          6 integrin on mature TGFβ 
          1 mediated growth inhibition in Panc-1
          cells. As shown in the additional file 10, combined
          treatment with α 
          V and β 
          6 blocking antibodies almost
          completely abolished the effect of mature TGFβ 
          1 on the growth of Panc-1 cells. We
          therefore postulate that the growth inhibition of TGFβ 
          1 is synergistically influenced by α 
          V β 
          6 integrin.

        Discussion
        A recent study demonstrated an interaction of latent
        TGFβ 
        1 with α 
        V β 
        6 integrin, which led to an activation
        of latent TGFβ 
        1 [ 45 ] . Incubation of different tumor
        cells with mature TGFβ 
        1 resulted in a direct binding of TGFβ 
        1 to α 
        V β 
        6 integrin. Certain integrins appear to
        be preferentially associated with specific growth factor
        receptors [ 80 ] . The interaction of these two receptor
        classes seems to take place via the actin cytoskeleton. We
        were able to exclude such signal pathway association, since
        in our cytoskeletal preparations, no TGFβ 
        1 -receptors were detectable, indicating
        that mature TGFβ 
        1 is a ligand for α 
        V β 
        6 .
        It has been reported that activated integrins are
        associated with the cytoskeleton. Here, we show that
        binding of mature TGFβ 
        1 to α 
        V β 
        6 integrin resulted in an association of
        the cytoskeleton (Figure 10). In a variety of
        integrin-mediated signaling pathways,
        tyrosinephosphorylation of proteins immobilized to the
        cytoskeleton is enhanced [ 66 67 ] . The same was true in
        our experimental settings only for the TGFβ 
        1 -sensitive cells. This upregulation of
        tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by preincubation
        with a TGFβ 
        1 neutralizing antibody or by blocking
        of α 
        V β 
        6 integrin, thus again proving mature
        TGFβ 
        1 as an initial signaling ligand for α 
        V β 
        6 .
        Binding of mature TGFβ 
        1 to α 
        V β 
        6 integrin exerts several downstream
        effects in TGFβ 
        1 -sensitive cells (Figure 9). One is a
        marked phosphorylation of p125 FAK. This phosphorylation is
        dependent on the integrity of the cytoskeleton, as
        disruption of actin filaments by cytochalasin D completely
        eliminated this effect, findings which have also been
        reported for several integrin signaling pathways [ 66 67 ]
        . Moreover, incubation of the TGFβ 
        1 sensitive carcinoma cells with TGFβ 
        1 caused immobilization of the docking
        protein p130 casand of the guanine nucleotide exchange
        factor SOS to the cytoskeleton. Beyond this, a marked
        induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 WAF1and p27
        KIPand a decrease in PCNA expression was detectable.
        Finally, TGFβ 
        1 caused an activation of p21Ras and the
        MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2. This TGFβ 
        1 -induced expression profile was not
        affected by preincubation of SMAD4 deleted BxPC-3 cells
        with a TGFβ 
        1 -RII blocking antibody, which was able
        to completely block TGFβ 
        1 -induced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, thus
        demonstrating the independence of the TGFβ 
        1 -signaling from the known SMAD pathway
        in BxPC-3 cells. In contrast, preincubation with α 
        V - and β 
        6 -blocking antibodies curbed the TGFβ 
        1 -induced regulation of p21/WAF1, p27,
        c-fos, and the p21Ras and ERK1/2 activation, verifying that
        the binding of TGFβ 
        1 to the α 
        V β 
        6 integrin is a prerequisite for the
        activation of the signal pathway via the α 
        V β 
        6 integrin. Preincubation of the cells
        with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 curbed the TGFβ 
        1 -induced regulation of these genes as
        well, indicating the involvement of the MAP kinase pathway
        in TGFβ 
        1 signaling in BxPC-3 cells. As shown
        recently, the growth-stimulatory effect of the TGFβ
        superfamily member BMP-2on CAPAN-1 cells was blocked by
        this inhibitor as well [ 81 82 83 ] , supporting our
        findings.
        Indeed, cytoskeletal immobilization of p130cas and SOS
        was not prevented by the MEK1 inhibitor PD 98059. Thus,
        these proteins are good candidates to link the
        integrin-mediated TGFβ 
        1 signaling to the MAP kinase pathway,
        as was shown previously for signaling events induced by
        fluid stress or integrin mediated cell-adhesion in other
        cell types [ 71 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 ] .
        In order to generalize the integrin mediated TGFβ 
        1 -pathway identified in the SMAD4
        deleted pancreatic tumor cell line BxPC-3, we investigated
        TGFβ 
        1 signaling in the cervical carcinoma
        cell line HeLa and the mammary carcinoma cell lines MCF-7
        and MDA-MB-231, harboring a wildtype SMAD4-gene. TGFβ 
        1 bound to α 
        V β 
        6 -integrin in these cells as well, and
        this interaction resulted both in an immobilization of
        p130Cas and SOS1/2 and in tyrosine phosphorylation of
        cytoskeleton-associated proteins such as p125FAK. TGFβ 
        1 stimulation of these cells acvtivated
        p21Ras and MAPK ERK1/2, upregulated c-fos, c-jun/AP1,
        p21/WAF1 and p27 expression, and resulted a decrease of
        PCNA, similar to its actions in BxPC-3 cells. Preincubation
        with a TGFβ-RII blocking antibody attenuated the TGFβ 
        1 induced pattern, contrary to SMAD 4
        deleted BxPC-3 cells. This preincubation also decreased
        activation of p21Ras and of MAPK ERK1/2, indicating the
        participation of the Ras/MAPK-pathway in TGFβ 
        1 induced transcriptional
        activation.
        The same attenuation of TGFβ 
        1 induced gene expression and the
        decrease in p21Ras and MAPK ERK1/2 activation was
        observable after preincubation of SMAD4 wildtype cells with
        α 
        V β 
        6 -blocking antibodies, demonstrating
        that TGFβ 
        1 signaling via α 
        V β 
        6 -integrin also is linked to the
        Ras/MAPK-pathway, and that both pathways have synergistic
        effects in TGFβ 
        1 -signaling. Full TGFβ 
        1 induced transcriptional activation is
        only reached if both pathways are completed. This finding
        is supported by the observation that activation of p21/Ras
        and MAPK ERK1/2 induced by TGFβ 
        1 is only reverted to the control level
        by the combination of the TGFβ-RII blocking antibody and
        the α 
        V β 
        6 -blocking antibodies, or by inhibition
        of MEK1.
        Linking of the TGFβ-R pathway to the Ras/MAPK pathway is
        dependent on a functional SMAD4 gene product, because TGFβ 
        1 induced gene expression and activation
        of Ras and ERK1/2 is attenuated by the TGFβ-RII blocking
        antibody only in SMAD4 wild type cells, whereas in the
        SMAD4 deleted BxPC-3 cells, no such influence was
        observable.
        Based on our results, we suggest the following model of
        TGFβ 
        1 -signaling, which offers an
        explanation for the different growth responses to TGFβ 
        1 (Fig. 10). In the TGFβ 
        1 -sensitive cell lines with intact SMAD
        pathway, the TGFβ 
        1 response can be attributed to both the
        common SMAD signaling pathway and the integrin pathway
        described above. In the cell line BxPC-3, lacking the SMAD4
        gene product, the SMAD4-independent pathway can explain the
        TGFβ 
        1 sensitivity via α 
        V β 
        6 integrin, the cytoskeleton and the
        Ras/MAP kinase pathway, resulting in an upregulation of the
        cell cycle inhibitiors p21/WAF1 and p27, which in turn
        results in the TGFβ 
        1 -induced growth inhibition (additional
        file 10).
        The cell lines Capan-1 and AsPC-1 are not only resistant
        to TGFβ 
        1 because of their alterations in the
        SMAD pathway, but also because they cannot complete the
        alternate pathway, as demonstrated above. Furthermore, this
        alternate pathway may explain the TGFβ 
        1 resistance of cells with no detectable
        defect in the SMAD pathway [ 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
        101 ] , as one can imagine that the cooperative action of
        the both pathways is necessary to exert the complete growth
        inhibitory effect of TGFβ 
        1 . Comparable effects have been
        described for the synergistic operation of growth factor
        receptor and anchorage dependent integrin signaling [ 102
        103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117
        118 119 ] .
        Recombinant mature TGFβ 
        1 does not contain a RGD motif, and thus
        binding of TGFβ 
        1 to the α 
        V β 
        6 integrin and the subsequent activation
        of this integrin must rely on a novel motif distinct from
        RGD. For α 
        V β 
        6 integrin, a novel non-RGD ligand
        recognition motif was recently described with the consensus
        motif DLXXL [ 120 ] .
        This motif has been detected on several proteins,
        including laminin, collagen and fibrinogen [ 120 ] . A
        BLAST search for this sequence in TGFβ 
        1 revealed a 70% similar motif in two
        parts of the molecule; one in the LAP (data not shown) and
        one in the mature TGFβ 
        1 . In mature TGFβ 
        1 , the DLXXL motif is freely accessible
        for interactions on the outside of the molecule. Therefore,
        it may be speculated that TGFβ 
        1 binding to α 
        V β 
        6 via this novel ligand recognition
        motif is facilitating the signaling. Moreover, a non-RGD
        ligand binding pocket in addition to the usual RGD binding
        site has been demonstrated for fibrinogen and the α 
        IIb β 
        3 integrin [ 121 ] , supporting our
        findings.
      
      
        Conclusions
        We demonstrate an alternate TGFβ 
        1 signaling pathway via α 
        V β 
        6 integrin, independent of SMAD4. This
        pathway seems to be required for full TGFβ 
        1 induced transcriptional activation,
        which explains the TGFβ 
        1 sensitivity of those cells lacking
        DPC4/SMAD4 function that still react with growth
        inhibition.
      
      
        Methods
        
          Cell Culture and TGFβ 1stimulation
          All cells were obtained from from ATCC and maintained
          in DMEM supplemented with 17% fetal calf serum.
          Recombinant human proteins (mature TGFβ 
          1 , TNF-α, Fibronectin and Laminin 1)
          were purchased from R&D Systems. 10 6cells were grown
          overnight in 6 cm diameter dishes with DMEM/10 % FCS.
          After washing twice with PBS (pH 7.4), fresh DMEM without
          FCS was added to the monolayer. Cells were stimulated
          with 10 nM of mature TGFβ 
          1 or with fibronectin as described
          below. In blocking experiments, cells were preincubated
          with either a TGFβ 
          1 -RII-blocking antibody (R&D
          Systems # AF-241-NA, 15 μg/ml for 30 min), α 
          V and β 
          6 -blocking antibodies (Santa Cruz,
          sc-6617 and sc-6632 respectively, 1:100 each for 30 min),
          or the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (New England Biolabs #
          9900S, 7.5 ng/ml for 10 min) before stimulation with
          mature TGFβ 
          1 .
        
        
          Indirect immunofluorescence
          For indirect immunofluorescence, 10 4cells were
          cultured on glass coverslips, stimulated with 10 nM
          mature TGFβ 
          1 for 10 minutes, stained as described
          [ 66 67 ] and viewed using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal
          microscope. Antibodies used were: actin (sc-8432), TGFβ 
          1 (sc-146), α 
          V (sc-6617) and β 
          6 (sc-6632). The following
          fluorochrome-labeled antibodies were used (AlexaFluor,
          Molecular Probes): goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugate
          (#A-11032; red), goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate
          (#A-11046; blue), and donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L)
          conjugate (#A-11055; green).
        
        
          Preparation of cytoplasmatic proteins and of
          nuclei
          Cellular fractionation was performed as described in
          earlier reports [ 122 123 124 125 ] . Cells were scraped
          into 100 μl of ice-cold buffer A [10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9);
          1.5 mM MgCl 
          2 ; 10 mM KCl; 0.5 mM DTT; 0.05%
          NP-40]. Nuclei were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 10
          sec. at 4°C and 15,000 G. The supernatant was used to
          analyze cytoplasmatic proteins, nuclei were resuspended
          in 60 μl of ice cold buffer B [20 mM Hepes (pH 7.9); 25%
          (v/v) glycerol; 420 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl 
          2 ; 0.2 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM DTT; 0.5 mM
          PMSF] and incubated on ice for 15 min.
        
        
          Preparation of actin filaments of the cytoskeleton
          and immunoprecipitation
          The cell monolayer was incubated with cell extraction
          buffer [0.1 % Triton X-100, 80 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole, 2
          mM MgCl 
          2 , 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.8] for 5 min at
          4°C. The Triton-insoluble fractions were then scraped
          into cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer [50 mM Tris/HCl (pH
          7.4); 100 mM NaCl; 50 mM NaF; 5 mM EDTA; 40 mM
          glycerophosphate; 1 mM sodium orthovanadate; 100 μM PMSF;
          1 μM leupeptin; 1 μM pepstatin A; 1% (v/v) Triton X-100]
          and incubated for 20 min on ice, and clarified by
          centrifugation at 13000 g for 5 min at 4°C. For
          immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated for 4 h
          at 4°C with 1 μg of antibody (all from Santa Cruz)
          pre-adsorbed on Protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia).
          Immune complexes were washed five times with cold Triton
          X-100 lysis buffer. For re-precipitation, the pellet was
          boiled in 10 μl 0.1% SDS for 5 min and diluted 1:20 in
          the Triton X lysis buffer followed by the precipitation
          procedure. All samples were boiled in Laemmli denaturing
          buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Whole cell
          lysates serving as positive controls were prepared by
          incubating monolayers with denaturing Laemmli buffer.
        
        
          Treatment with Cytochalasin and Calcium
          Chelator
          To disrupt the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton,
          the cell monolayer was treated with 25 nM cytochalasin D
          for 20 min at 37°C; TGFβ 
          1 was then applied in the presence of
          25 nM cytochalasin D. For chelating intracellular
          calcium, the cells were preincubated with 5 μM of
          1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane- 
          N , 
          N , 
          N ', 
          N '-tetraacetic acid, acetoxymethyl
          ester (BAPTA-AM) for 15 min. TGFβ 
          1 was then applied in the presence of
          5 μM of BAPTA.
        
        
          [ 3H]-thymidine incorporation assay
          For the TGFβeta 
          1 growth inhibition assay, cells were
          seeded in 96-well microtitier plates at 10 4cells/well in
          100 μl of culture medium containing 10% FCS. After 24 h,
          medium was replaced by culture medium supplemented with
          0.5% FCS. After an additional 24 h, cells were treated
          with 10 nM of mature TGFβ 
          1 . After incubation with TGFβ 
          1 for 21 h, cells were pulsed with 200
          nCi of [ 3H]-thymidine (1.74 TBq/mmol; Amersham, UK) for
          3 h without changing the medium. Cells were washed once
          with PBS, incubated with trypsin for 10 min and collected
          by using a Skatron cell harvester. Radioactivity
          incorporated was determined by liquid scintillation
          counting.
        
        
          Western Blot
          Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
          a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche) as described
          previously [ 66 ] . Blot membranes were blocked for 3 h
          at 37°C in PBS containing 5 % skim milk and probed with
          the respective antibodies (16 h at 4°C). The following
          antibodies were used in a dilution of 1:1,000: TGFβ 
          1 (Santa Cruz [sc], sc-146), p-Tyr
          (sc-7020), β 
          6 -integrin (sc-6632), α 
          V -integrin (sc-6617), p125
          FAK(sc-557), TGFβ 
          1 -RI (sc-402), TGFβ 
          1 -RII (sc-400-G), ERK1/2-P (sc-7383),
          SMAD2/3 (sc-6033), SOS1/2 (sc-259), p130 cas(UBI-06-500),
          PCNA (sc-56), p21 WAF1(sc-6246), p27 KIP(sc-1641), c-fos
          (sc-7202), c-jun (sc-44), raf1 (sc-133), p21 Ras(sc-35)
          and phospho-threonine antibody (New England Biolabs, #
          9381). Detection antibodies (all from Dako; 1:5,000 for 1
          h at room temperature) were mouse-anti-goat Ig,
          mouse-anti-rat Ig, rabbit-anti-mouse Ig, and
          porcine-anti-rabbit Ig-HRP [ 66 ] . To visualize all
          transferred proteins, we used the ECL protein
          biotinylation labeling modules (RPN 2202, Amersham) and
          streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (V020402, Amersham) in
          accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
        
        
          Ras activation assay
          Only activated p21 Rasis able to bind Raf1, leading to
          a Raf1-translocation to the cell membrane. After
          stimulation with 10 nM mature TGFβ 
          1 for 10 minutes, cells were incubated
          in sterile water until they lysed. The membrane fraction
          was lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Precipitation
          against Raf1 and analysis for p21 Rasfollowed.
