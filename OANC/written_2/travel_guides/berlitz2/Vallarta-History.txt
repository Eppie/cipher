A Brief History
Throughout the centuries-old history of Mexico’s Pacific Coast, this region has been both a refuge and an important point for conducting trade.
The region’s history has some marked differences from the history of Mexico as a country. Although artifacts show that both the Aztec and Olmec pre-Hispanic cultures had a presence in the area, ancient civilizations created no notable settlements here. This fact, coupled with the geography of the region, spared it much of the bloodshed and turmoil of the Spanish conquest. With the imposing Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range running the length of the Pacific coastline, isolating it from the rest of mainland Mexico, the Pacific coast was able to develop at a slower, more tranquil pace.
Most pre-Hispanic tribes that inhabited the coastal areas were peaceful traders and fishermen, and their trading legacy continued well after the conquest of Mexico by Spain. Several of the ports that were important prior to the conquest have — in one way or another — remained on the map as major destinations to this day.
Puerto Vallarta
Puerto Vallarta was launched into the international spotlight when Hollywood director John Huston decided to film the Tennessee Williams’ play, Night of the Iguana, on nearby Mismaloya Beach. Its history, however, runs much deeper than that event. Recent archeological findings show six different cultures lived in the area, with settlements dating back to 300 b.c. The most important was part of the kingdom of Xalisco, centered in the modern state of Nayarit. A marked Aztec influence is also present, probably due to the centuries-long migration of Aztecs from the legendary city of Aztlán, on the Pacific coast, to Tenochtitlan, present-day Mexico City. Remains of these cultures can be seen in the Museo del Río Cuale.
The first Spaniard to encounter these Nahuatl settlements was Hernán Cortez’s nephew, Francisco Cortez de Buenaventura. He arrived at the Jalisco-Nayarit coast in 1524, shortly after the fall of Tenochtitlan. He was met by “…a formidable army of 20,000 warriors, their bows decorated by myriad colored banners…” This impressive assembly earned the fertile Río Ameca Valley (just north of present day Puerto Vallarta) the name Valle de Banderas (Valley of the Banners), and the great bay just in front of the valley became known as Bahía de Banderas.
During colonial days the bay was visited by both Spanish galleons and pirate ships looking for shelter, repairs, or supplies. It was during this time that foreign navigators referred to the bay as Humpback Bay, or Bahía de las Jorobadas, because of the large number of humpback whales that appeared — and still appear — every winter.
In the early 1800s gold and silver were found in the Sierra Madre Mountains, spurring an explosive growth of mining towns, including Talpa de Allende and San Sebastián. The mines needed salt to process the ore, and an enterprising man named Guadalupe Sánchez found the perfect location for this by the mouth of the Río Cuale. He and his family became the salt suppliers for the Cuale and San Sebastián silver mines. Others arrived to take part in this lucrative trade, and in 1851 the village, called Puerto Las Peñas, was established.
The village grew steadily, and by 1895 construction began on the church in the town center, Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, named after the Virgin of Guadalupe, patron saint of the town. Sánchez originally founded the town on December 12th, the anniversary of the Virgin’s appearance.
As Las Peñas grew, San Sebastián faded. At its peak in the late 1800s, San Sebastián was one of the most productive mining towns in all Mexico, with a population of over 20,000 (today it has fewer than 2,000 residents). In 1912, governmental functions were moved to Las Peñas, and by 1819, Las Peñas was designated as a municipality, and its name changed to Puerto Vallarta.
Without any highways or an airport to connect it to other major cities, Puerto Vallarta remained in secluded tranquility for almost 50 years — until the 1963 filming of Night of the Iguana. The Hollywood production attracted the attention of the international media, who came looking for gossip about the torrid romances of the film’s legendary stars. Night of the Iguana’s biggest star, however, turned out to be the quaint village of Puerto Vallarta.
The movie’s leading man, Richard Burton, and his new love, Elizabeth Taylor, were so charmed by the town that they bought homes there, as did director John Huston. Throngs of tourists followed. Many became residents, building homes of their own on the hillsides overlooking the river and bay, creating what is now known as Gringo Gulch. Huston’s friend, the Mexican architect Guillermo Wulff built most of these homes, giving Puerto Vallarta its defining style of white facades and red tile roofs.
Puerto Vallarta has continued to grow, and has become an important art center. It attracts an increasing number of visitors to its true Mexican ambiance, coupled with a modern resort environment.
Manzanillo and the Costa Alegre
Since its earliest days, Manzanillo has been considered an important trading port. Legend has it that the ancient residents of the area, the Colimans, who traded from this port — then known as Tzalagua — had contact with Chinese traders years before the arrival of the Spaniards.
When this rumor reached Cortez, he sent his own men to confirm it. The Spaniards named the place Manzanillo, and established it as a shipyard and launching point for expeditions across the Pacific. Its bay offered safe anchorage and a good shipbuilding site. Manzanillo saw considerable growth until the mid-1500s, when, in order to centralize trade, Acapulco was declared the only authorized port in Mexico.
The port of Manzanillo continued to quietly exist until 1889, when a railroad connected it inland. Telephone, electricity, drainage, and potable water services followed. These improvements helped transform Manzanillo into the modern port and manufacturing center it is today.
Manzanillo initially drew the interest of international visitors for its excellent fishing. An important annual fishing tournament prompted the construction of modest hotels and condos. In the 1970s, the development, along with the new airport, of the Club Maeva and Las Hadas resorts, with their striking Moorish design, began to bring in a steady flow of tourists. Then the movie Ten, starring Bo Derek and Dudley Moore and filmed in Las Hadas, put Manzanillo squarely in the spotlight.
The beaches and coves along the Costa Alegre, were also popular with pirates and Spanish traders 400 years ago. Melaque and Barra de Navidad were visited in 1523 by Spanish conquistadors in search of a mythical place believed to have an unlimited quantity of pearls, and to be inhabited only by women. A select number of tourists discovered Melaque and Barra de Navidad in the 1950s, and the towns have grown gracefully since.
Ixtapa–Zihuatanejo: From Pre-Hispanic Resort to Modern Paradise
Zihuatanejo’s azure waters caught the attention of tourists long before Mexico became a Spanish colonial empire. Legend has it that the Tarascan emperor Caltzonzin built a royal beach retreat on the popular Zihuatanejo beach of Las Gatas, somewhere around a.d. 1400. He turned this already tranquil beach into a virtual wading pool by building a breakwater to keep the waters within it completely calm and crystalline. The mysterious Olmecs, from the Gulf Coast of Mexico, left their unmistakable influence here around 1000 b.c., evidenced by ceramics featuring jaguar-like and Negroid features. Today, some of these may be seen in the Museo Arqueológico de la Costa Grande in Zihuatanejo.
In the early 1500s, Aztecs conquered the province of Coyuca, located between present-day Zihuatanejo and the Coyuca lagoon, and established a coastal capital, which they called Zihuatlan, “Place of Women,” named for the local matriarchal society. Residents today claim that the place was named for the beauty of the women, and means, “place of beautiful women.”
Zihuatanejo was claimed for the Spanish crown by Juan Alvarez Chico in 1522. The town and port saw little action during colonial days and it slumbered quietly, hosting a few lost galleons and pirate ships that happened to stop for repairs or supplies. Local lore tells how one such ship, upon returning from its travels to China, lost hundreds of rolls of silk. The name La Ropa (“the Clothing”) was given to the beach where the silk later washed ashore.
It wasn’t until over 400 years later, in the mid-1960s, that this quiet village was awakened with the development of Ixtapa. FONATUR (Mexico’s national fund for tourism development) chose this location because of its 7.5 km (5 miles) of pristine beaches, located near a picturesque village. Today Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa meld into a complementary combination that offers the best of both worlds: the quirky character of Zihuatanejo and the deluxe mega-development of Ixtapa.
Acapulco: Colonial Gateway to the Orient and Playground to the Stars 
Many regard Acapulco as the original Mexican beach resort with its glimmering beaches and glitzy nightlife. Yet its history extends far beyond its present-day appeal — artifacts found here date back to 2500 b.c. Inhabitants of this zone are known to have traded with several cultures, possibly including the Polynesians. There is clear evidence of trade with the Tarascan, Mixtec, and Zapotec empires that extended to the north and south of Acapulco prior to Mexico’s conquest by Spain.
In 1528, the Spanish Crown claimed Acapulco, and established it as the departure point for a trade route to the Orient. A later decree gave Acapulco exclusivity as the only authorized port on the Pacific coast, and for 200 years, it was the unrivaled trading center of Pacific Mexico. The yearly arrival of the Nao de China, a galleon that sailed to Manila and back during these years, was the occasion for an annual merchant fair that drew traders from all over the colony.
Before long, pirates heard about the riches brought to Acapulco — the port was visited both by Sir Francis Drake and the British pirate, Thomas Cavendish. Cavendish eventually captured the Nao (1587) and got away with 1.2 million in gold. To guard the port from these attacks, the Spaniards built the impressive Fuerte de San Diego in 1616. Although an earthquake destroyed it in 1776, the fort was rebuilt in 1783, and today houses a small but interesting museum.
The Nao trade route continued until the early 1800s, when José María Morelos y Pavón, a hero of Mexico’s War of Independence, took over Acapulco and stopped the trade, sending the town into a century-long respite, a hiatus that ended only when the Mexican government paved the highway between Mexico City and Acapulco. The beautiful beaches of Acapulco Bay immediately lured Mexico City’s elite, and the metamorphosis began, from slumbering trading port into the “Pearl of the Pacific,” as the media came to know it in the 1930s.
The first airplanes from the US began to arrive in the mid-1930s, and with them came a bevy of notorious visitors, from movie stars to presidents, writers to millionaires. Acapulco became the playground for the rich and famous. Glitzy hotels went up in a hurry, supported by new boulevards, power plants, and a superhighway. Acapulco’s peak was the 1940s to 1960s. Celebrated images included Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner sipping margaritas while watching cliff divers at La Quebrada, President Eisenhower meeting Mexico’s President López Mateos for a summit conference in a new high rise hotel, and Johnny Weissmuller swimming laps in the Flamingos Hotel pool overlooking Acapulco Bay.
Since those glory days Acapulco has aged — maybe not quite as gracefully as its fans would have hoped. However, the “Perla del Pacífico” still attracts scores of vacationers, who are still regaled by old stories about the rich and famous, told by seasoned waiters as they serve pool-side drinks with a weathered but unwavering smile.
Puerto Escondido and Huatulco
Even though Puerto Escondido is the more mature tourist destination of the two, Huatulco has the deepest historical roots. The Aztecs and Chichimecs (a Nahuatl-speaking warrior community) knew Huatulco as an important trading port long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors.
The name Huatulco is of Aztec origin and means “land where a tree is worshipped,” reflecting the intriguing legend of the “Santa Cruz de Huatulco” (“Sacred Cross of Huatulco”). When the Spaniards arrived at Huatulco in the late 1530s, the local Indians showed them a massive cross by the edge of the shore that they worshipped. A legend arose that the cross may have been left by an ancient saint — perhaps even the Apostle Thomas — some fifteen centuries earlier. The cross remained during the Spanish conquest and even survived an attempt to destroy it by the pirate Cavendish. In 1612 Bishop Juan de Cervantes took part of the cross to the capital city of Oaxaca and used it as the foundation of a replica, which today stands in the main altar of the cathedral. Another piece was set in silver and sent to the Vatican.
For centuries the bays of Huatulco basked quietly under the sun. Then, in the mid-1970s, FONATUR turned its eyes towards the southern coast of Oaxaca and started a mega-development, scheduled for completion in 2020, on the nine bays of Huatulco.
Puerto Escondido was established in 1928 as a port for shipping coffee. Its importance diminished as coffee shipments began to be transported by truck. In the 1960s tourists discovered the town after it was connected to other coastal towns by Highway 200. With its renowned offshore break, Puerto Escondido became the ultimate destination for backpackers, flower children, surfers looking for the perfect wave, and those attracted by natural beauty and the laid-back pace. True escapists preferred to continue south and visit Puerto Angel, a fishing village that was Oaxaca’s busiest port for a brief period in the 1870s, before reverting back to its peaceable ways.
