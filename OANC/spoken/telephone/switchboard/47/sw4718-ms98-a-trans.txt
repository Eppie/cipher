 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		so what i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		go ahead
 	
 	
 		what what kind of benefit uh benefits do you have at work
 	
 	
 		well i i'm i work at a large company and uh
 		we have quite a quite a few benefits and uh we have um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the best benefit i like is the uh amount of uh vacation time especially after uh working working there for a long time it really build up to the amount of vacation time i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think that's one of my best benefits
 	
 	
 		oh yeah is there a something that you wished you had that you don't or
 	
 	
 		well one thing that i i uh
 		wish uh in a big company there's more bureaucracy and
 		uh less support of uh
 		what you're doing i think and uh that's something that um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is uh probably and a benefit of a smaller company you get more support from the the people that you work for
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i work for a relatively small company we're a trade association for credit unions and uh
 		our benefits are fairly good and like you say that support i mean you work directly with the president and the executive vice president and you know they you get the feedback from them directly and i like that but
 		i wish i really the thing i like i guess i wouldn't mind having a better retirement plan we have just a defined benefit plan and
 		i kind of would like the idea of having a 401K or something that i could you know contribute to and get some matching contributions
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that'd be a lot better i that's one thing i wish i had a little bit more of but
 	
 	
 		you're really thinking of the future
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i don't know i'm kind of the type i just don't wanna work my whole life i'd rather be able to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		make my money and be able to retire and enjoy a lot of things before
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so that's and that's one way i can see doing it but none of them
 	
 	
 		i work i work for the state of Florida and uh it's pretty good retirement plan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		we don't get paid very much but uh
 		retirement plan is pretty pretty good
 	
 	
 		works good
 		yeah that's like i say ours
 		we're we get uh vacation is pretty good too i mean it's you get a week after the first year two after the second three after the third and it goes up
 		just every year by a week up until i think like six years which is a lot better than anybody else i'd ever heard of uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's quite a bit of vacation to have after six years service so
 	
 	
 		did you say you work for a credit union
 	
 	
 		uh it it's a a credit union league they're kind of a trade association for credit unions we uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		kind of do a lot of the
 		uh political support and stuff like that
 		for the credit different credit unions within the state
 	
 	
 		yeah my wife used to work for a credit union group they magazine they had a newsletter that went out to all the
 	
 	
 		but
 		oh did she
 	
 	
 		all the uh credit union CEOs and people like that so she was really into the keeping up on what's going on with the credit unions
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 		huh what what did she work for
 	
 	
 		uh it was it was a company um i think it was called Credit Union News or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was based out of uh
 		i think it was Boca Raton Florida
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah that sounds pretty familiar to me
 	
 	
 		yeah it was pretty uh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		pretty glossy kind of uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		newsletter that comes out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh  do you get to
 		i don't know have you heard of any people that kind of do this uh the cafeteria plan where they kind of let you choose what kind of benefits you get or
 	
 	
 		uh not too much
 	
 	
 		is that something that Florida does or where your work the state of Florida or you pretty much get what they give you and
 	
 	
 		nah
 		yeah just i get what what you give in uh
 		that's uh
 		not not uh
 		with not too many choices
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess a lot of the more uh some of the newer companies and the up and coming real fast growing ones kind of do that way but some people say it ends up costing them more because whatever
 		you know men and women alike they give them say three hundred bucks a month and they can buy their health insurance and their retirement and whatever but
 		and if they whatever they don't use they get in cash
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but a lot of companies don't like to do that because they figure if you got two people working then one spouse might take insurance and the other won't so it saves the company money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whereas this one you know you'd end up paying regardless
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess
 	
 	
 		but for the employees it sure sounded like a pretty good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but anyway i haven't uh
 		haven't got so fortunate as to get into any of those companies yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		well hey it was good talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right see you later bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye
