 		uh appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen or you know in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i as far as a high school course i could see it as uh maybe a social uh sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and to me that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year but to tell them that they had to do two years there after post high school of community service i'm
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do
 	
 	
 		hum well that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it'd be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to uh mandatory
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah and yeah i kind of agree with that um
 		i don't think you know it it they shouldn't have they should have the same rights as anyone else
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you know it shouldn't be uh anything shouldn't be mandatory other than i guess like uh when you come to paying taxes or something like that
 		uh or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe
 		uh people be more eagle to do it uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		exactly
 		and doing it for a purpose that they want the other thing is this i have thought about this and many times when you get these uh young troubled teenagers that uh don't have like the perspective of uh
 		of of the community a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems but there are other people out in the community that may have problems
 		then i can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing you have to do so much as far as in a community service now if they were you know the abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or if uh they destroyed some property around the uh area then they would have to do uh to restore it and perhaps um
 		work um for the community to beautify it or whatever but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i could see that working in you know cases where the it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law
 		and teaching him that there is a whole community that is is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever and that's i think they have done that and
 		judges have said well you know this is what you're gonna get for um you know a misdemeanor misdemeanor or something you may end up having to do some kind of community service so i could see that as
 		something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh that's a good idea uh i think they should have more programs like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think uh us being taxpayers we pay for people that's in jail or in trouble anyway
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure we sure do
 	
 	
 		so they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and i i agree wholeheartedly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh the thing is that it's not enough of that kind of stuff going on uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because you like you say it's a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors why why have someone in your jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and sometimes you know putting them in jail it doesn't really help
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because there's nothing in there that to rebil rebilitate rehabilitate rebilihatate them and then when they get out they because they have the stigmatism of being in jail they can't
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah
 		um-hum
 		and there's a lot of anger sure you know especially if they haven't went through treatment and they dealt with other people in the uh system of prisons which
 		um you you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever i would say the crimes would probably be you know if you went in for a certain crime there might somebody that has has done a crime even worse than what you have so you're dealing with people
 		um that may uh be an influence later on and uh an issue of anger would be is that i went to prison for a year or two but i didn't get any rehabilitation or um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know but then again those that have physically assaulted somebody
 		um that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in the community if they're of a violent sort and to say well you have to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
