 
     		
 	
 		as far as news and uh keeping up with it i get a subscription to Time Newsweek and US News and World Report and i also stay in touch with CNN whenever there's something interesting happening in the world
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh do you do you actually read all those magazines every week
 	
 	
 		oh God i get  a lot more than that those are just the news magazines that i get i barely have time i usually
 		tear through um US News and World Report that's my least favorite i think i like Newsweek the most
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i uh i  i keep up with what's going on by listening to the radio in the car and reading a newspaper daily newspaper
 		and i i pretty much hardly ever uh see news on television
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've if you're near Boston uh i i remember hearing in the car we can pick up WBZ pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		out here in Rochester we i also get the morning paper here um we we're Gannett town so we have a morning and a afternoon paper both owned by Gannett
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i tend to read the morning paper just because it's more breaking news i also listen to short wave depending upon what the world conditions are like
 	
 	
 		oh so you can pick up Radio Moscow or that sort of thing huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah Radio Moscow it it's gotten a lot stranger in the last several years it's they've added commercials and they have bad jingles and everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so it's pretty much like U S radio huh
 	
 	
 		well that's what they're trying to emulate i think most people still head for the B B C World Service
 		which uh i i like that for international news but sometimes it gets you know usually if something major happens now i head for CNN
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that um the B B C World Service is broadcast on the F M band in near the Boston area
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they have it's it's distributed through American Public Radio i guess and
 	
 	
 		by our public radio station
 	
 	
 		yeah they have a feed of that yeah you can also a lot of various C-SPAN has an audio service
 	
 	
 		still
 	
 	
 		which transmits the BBC World Service twenty four hours a day
 		you know i in the only problem with that i have with getting the news from a lot of these places is probably the worst lately has become the newspaper because i i just despise fluff journalism
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i mean Iraq is bombed but no you're not going to see that today because here's Janey age five on the front page blowing bubbles you know
 	
 	
 		right or here's uh one presidential candidate candidate saying rude things about the other one's girlfriend or something yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i it it you know the worst of them all is USA Today which is  i call it useless today the McPaper
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's great
 	
 	
 		well they they um they have a pretty small vocabulary don't they they
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  it's about the six grade it's basically a newspaper for those that watch TV
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		it's pretty tough to find objective objective straight forward news i mean the the BBC's got their own slant their basically you know they're they're i think they're addressing their U S service to to Brits living here
 	
 	
 		but in
 		yeah that that's pretty they have some pretty obscure international news i mean like coming up next a five minute report on Nepal you know
 	
 	
 		yeah they do they do good stuff on Nepal and South Africa you can get good stuff on and you know India and but it's not necessarily close to
 		stuff i'm looking for they tend to make fun of the U S a lot i think
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's they they have A Letter From America i think it's Alastair Cooke
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		who um who's been doing that program forever who comments on what life in America is like and uh
 		most British seem more amused than anything else
 	
 	
 		well  maybe they're right what the heck
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		so yeah i i tend to we have cable here and that tends to be pretty good for news but i also have a satellite dish so i you can watch some pretty strange news things the feeds on there
 		especially during uh the Iraqi war where you could hear the anchor people you know screaming four letter words poor Bernie Shaw
 	
 	
 		yeah do they um do do you use any electronic type news services like a you know computer network news services anything like that
 	
 	
 		um i i have a uh you know i i found out about the service on Comp Dcom Telecom so we have access to
 		you know there's there's um Clara News and you can also get on CompuBucks and uh read the news wires on there which you know i appreciate that one if i want to search for a particular topic you know that i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you subscribe to Clara Net service then
 	
 	
 		yeah well either that or you can go on Clara News and use it or i'm sorry uh CompuServe and use their executive news service if you want to follow you know certain key words and i use to do that when we were interested in following the cable industry
 		you know you wouldn't see this stuff in the local paper
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		yeah we don't get the where i where i work i don't we don't get the Clara Net stuff
