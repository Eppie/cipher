 
     		
 	
 		been on the line for awhile i almost forgot what the topic was
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay um based
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh but i know what it is  uh let me see i i i i i'm kind of i don't know you know i'm i'm kind of in the middle i i think it's a great idea
 	
 	
 		oh okay good
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but when it comes to me it's like almost an insult you know so it's  i i've come from the teaching field
 	
 	
 		right so do i
 	
 	
 		so
 		so it's just like i don't know i
 		i guess i guess i'd have to go with uh i i i'd be for it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know but uh
 		you know i i i don't know it's just kind of a
 		kind of a delicate subject i guess but i i i would i would probably go for for going ahead and doing it you know if it's got to be done for everyone
 	
 	
 		right i think if it's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know when they answer the company i think it'll make it a lot easier and they'd run into less problems
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh i don't know i come from the teaching field too and it sort of uh  it's a pro and a con type i don't know where to stand on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm more or less if they told me i had to well then fine but if you know if they made me then i'd probably if i had my druthers i'd probably say well no  you know just this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah  you kind of goes into your privacy and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know but i guess if they you know you know there's uh i i guess there's some companies that aren't  that are doing it and it it seems to be working out so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i think it's it's what they're basically trying to do i don't know up here in Massachusetts anyhow what they're basically trying to do is uh
 		oh gosh uh any people who had drug tested positively getting them into a drug program or rehab program
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh anybody who uh gee is you know did doesn't accept the rehab program then they're more or less getting laid off
 	
 	
 		see that's hard
 	
 	
 		i i think that's really hard to because you know you never know i don't know it's it that's a it's really weird issue i'm sort of on the fence about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i you know that that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow oh we can get you into a drug program but then you wear that stigma you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where uh like a lot of people are saying well i only smoked a joint last night i don't have any problems you know or something like that yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and then i kind of hear it goes into like uh this is just something i've heard that it kind of goes into like uh just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold that it kind of affects that too
 	
 	
 		right anything with an a you know if you drink a lot of caffeine or yeah somebody was saying telling me if you drink it in you know an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that
 		um
 	
 	
 		i know i'm an epileptic so i'd probably test positive and
 	
 	
 		yeah see things like that so
 	
 	
 		and then i'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and a lot of times those are the things i don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you  you know it's very personal
 	
 	
 		right right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't want to have it disclosed because then i'd always wonder if they fired me you know why did you fire me
 	
 	
 		see that's
 		yeah that's where i kind of get into cause it's just kind of gets into your personal life you know and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's like what's what's kind of next
 	
 	
 		yeah it it hits me as the Orwell thing Big brother is watching
 	
 	
 		the what
 	
 	
 		Orwell
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and you know his book Big brother is watching
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know you're being controlled  that type of deal and i shy i don't really you know i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		seems awful strange i'd hate to have to  if i had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't i'd probably take the company who didn't
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i feel there'd be more trust in the employees
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i can understand why they need it with all the you know train accidents and everything else
 	
 	
 		so do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually i kind of think they will
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i think they will too because uh you know it's just going to follow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i we haven't had any of it in our school system
 		so uh you know hopefully we won't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		we haven't either
 		oh yeah but i i i just kind of think it's heading that way though you know it's just  because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff and i just
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way
 	
 	
 		well and eventually it's going to be not only the teachers you know the kids are going to be under scrutiny it's going to be the teachers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then they've you know caught everybody more
 	
 	
 		yeah
