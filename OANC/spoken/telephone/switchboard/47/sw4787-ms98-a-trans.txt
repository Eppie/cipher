 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have you ever done this
 	
 	
 		yes i have
 	
 	
 		what did you do
 	
 	
 		unfortunately
 		
 
 	
 	
 		unfortunately  uh oh  this will be interesting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it yeah it it's it's really hard to please everybody
 		and it it takes a lot of planning a lot more
 		a lot more effort  you know you have to decided what you're going to do
 		have you ever done one
 	
 	
 		well
 		actually i'd i sort of do this uh anytime my family comes to town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean we have a very immediate family it's not really extended
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i was an only child my mother is an only child so we don't have
 		like tons and tons of relatives
 		so it's really my parents and i have five children three are married and they have little kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so you know it's basically us
 		and so when every body comes it is very hectic
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i guess that's as close to what we have as a reunion and we do this at Christmas
 		and we just did this last week
 		and so um it's hard to get
 		everyone to be able to come at the same time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's the hard part is was my son was missing last week because
 		he's a teacher and he had things he had to do and he couldn't just leave but
 		uh it's really hard to get everyone together
 		but we don't have lots of
 		aunts and uncles and things like that
 		to consider
 	
 	
 		yeah our um uh the ones i was involved in was with my wife's family
 		and it's very extended
 		there are aunts and great-aunts and cousins and cousin's children
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be so much harder
 	
 	
 		and there's
 		oh  over the last fourteen years depending on where we went and what we did there's anywhere from
 		and thirty or forty to
 		fifty sixty and sometimes
 		more than that you know during different phases of what we're trying to do
 	
 	
 		uh
 		so how often do you try to all get together
 	
 	
 		um they try every year
 	
 	
 		oh no are you all from the same place pretty much or
 	
 	
 		we're kind of in the same area most everybody is from uh Idaho and Utah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there are some from
 		there well there's a couple back east and they travel they've come a few times there's some from California
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think there's some from Washington
 	
 	
 		where do you have these things i mean how long do they
 	
 	
 		usually we've been having them in Idaho
 		that's where
 	
 	
 		it's at someone's house or i mean
 	
 	
 		um no we've had them out in uh kind of wilderness uh areas before we go camping
 	
 	
 		so you go camping do you i see well that's kind of good
 	
 	
 		and we've had them at resorts uh you know smaller resort places uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know kind of like camp ground things
 	
 	
 		but that way no one has all the work i mean once it's planned
 		nobody has to worry about fixing food for everybody and that kind of thing right
 	
 	
 		well we we do uh
 		we we have some traditional things and the first night's usually like a potluck
 		everybody just brings whatever they want and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we have those kind of foods and and then usually the first morning breakfast is just that each body does their own
 		and then have games all day
 	
 	
 		so there is a lot of planning though for things like that i guess anyway huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah there there is we we do uh
 		uh you know  we have we have quite a few we have a sing along one of the uncles plays the guitar and sings and then everybody puts on a talent show each family's supposed to
 	
 	
 		that's so neat though that's great
 	
 	
 		do talent show things and we have an an auction everybody brings in made goods or things that they do and we have an auction and then that goes into the family fund
 	
 	
 		oh
 		and who has the family fund
 	
 	
 		and well they elect officers every year
 	
 	
 		you're kidding i have never heard of this
 	
 	
 		uh they have uh
 		yeah they have a they have a a president usually they try to elect the family
 		and inside that family there'll be the president and or the chairman or whatever and then each person has an assignment to
 		to you know carry out one part of the thing like one one one person will have
 		um the games and one will have the food and one will have
 		the auction and one'll have the program
 	
 	
 		oh boy that's a big job for one family
 	
 	
 		whatever it is
 		so it well well when i'm talking family it's it's like my mother-in-law my mother-in-law's children so that'd my wife and her her sisters and brothers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i see so it's separated really yeah
 	
 	
 		right
 		so it's um it uh you know it's extended it's extended family what it is is my mother my mother-in-law and her sisters and brothers
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and their
 		oh i don't know there's twelve of them or fourteen of them or something like that
 		not all of them are living still but there's probably eight or nine that still are
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and then all of their kids and their kid's kids and
 	
 	
 		yeah i see
 	
 	
 		so it's
