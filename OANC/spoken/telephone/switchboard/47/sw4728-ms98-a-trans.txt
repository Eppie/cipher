 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know what you drive now i mean what do you drive now
 	
 	
 		uh i have a Ford pickup and uh the family car is a uh a Dodge uh Caravan  and uh because we have three kids and they're under thirteen
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		throw them in the back
 	
 	
 		they sort of fit our requirement yeah i have a one of those uh pickups with the uh
 	
 	
 		cap
 	
 	
 		seat with a seat in the back
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and so they just fit in there when they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work but right now i can right now i can throw them all in the back when we have room and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there you go
 	
 	
 		and since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back and i kind of like having a pickup truck actually i think of it as a  as a car that'll last
 	
 	
 		yeah you're
 		right yeah i know
 	
 	
 		i i like the way trucks are built and i don't care about comfort so i'm pretty happy
 	
 	
 		yeah you're looking at i got a Toyota Four Runner i wanted a truck that i i wanted something that i could throw people in the back too so i got a Four Runner
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i wouldn't hesitate to get another one i i never buy new so i wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck
 	
 	
 		you're just like me i've never bought a new vehicle in my life
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh yeah i don't i don't i don't need to pay for the glitz i'll let somebody else uh have the showroom shine enough and i'll pay for the rest of it
 	
 	
 		no
 		
 
 		let somebody else break it in right
 	
 	
 		right and uh the van we're sort sort of we might go again on a on a van uh we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we have to we we'll have to face it in a couple of years but uh i i guess we had a small Toyota wagon
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and we were real happy with that because uh my my second requirement after price is uh low maintenance and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that it certainly had that we didn't do much to it at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah my my the pretty much the same i i got a like i said i got one of those Toyota Four Runners
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it pretty much does everything i need it to i mean it it'll tow three thousand pounds so i can tow everything and it i can throw i've had eleven people in it before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		believe it or not and uh
 		it's real reliable believe i i mean i've had it for almost four years now and up until oh say two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then of course two weeks ago it decided i don't know it's the strangest weirdest thing in the world but it blew a head gasket
 	
 	
 		uh-oh
 	
 	
 		didn't do any damage to it um i caught it real early
 	
 	
 		uh-huh at how many
 		at how many miles
 	
 	
 		um oh ninety seven thousand so it's not real early
 	
 	
 		huh
 		and you didn't overheat it
 	
 	
 		no never overheated it i smell i smelled the uh i smelled the coolant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		went out and looked saw it was coming saw where it was coming from drove it right to the shop and left it off
 	
 	
 		huh well that was minimum
 	
 	
 		and that was it because i  i have that and then i have a a Kawasaki motorcycle
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if i can take it and it's not raining
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i mean that's that's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle it it's a i don't know people who buy motorcycles for transportation i think are kidding themselves
 	
 	
 		i have one colleague that uh commutes to work on one when it's not raining and uh uh
 		he's a it's
 		he's pretty conservative guy i don't think it's much of a sport for him i guess uh
 	
 	
 		i know but i bet you he really enjoys riding it
 	
 	
 		i'm sure he does yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so you know you how when was the last time you took out took your truck out just to just to go driving
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		and i go out twice a week on the bike so at least just for the enjoyment
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's like
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah i i mean the only thing i think i might get in a new car or not necessarily a new car but a another car um i would consider going to a a non
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to a normal pickup rather than a a covered pickup like the one i got just because there's a lot of times i wished i had the uh just an open bed to throw stuff in
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm sure i'm sure that that's very i mean you got one it's that's really convenient just be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and
 	
 	
 		if i only had some place that i could store the uh camper top i would have it off most of the time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i really leave it on there just for just to have it out of the way because it put it on the ground it gets dirty
 	
 	
 		and to have have it out of the way right
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah they're solid uh trucks are built uh i mean
 	
 	
 		i think they last a lot longer than anything else
 	
 	
 		they're the only things Americans still know how to build and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah the trucks do um even though you know the Jap the little Jap trucks are are good there too but so are the though i think the Chevys i don't think the Chevy i don't like the Chevys as much as i like the Fords
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think they i think the Fords tend to last a little longer least until recently
 	
 	
 		right
 		i kind of like mine yeah so  mine's a Ford  and uh
 	
 	
 		a friend of mine just bought or bought like a year ago it's it's a really a nice truck i mean i don't like Dodges at all but one of the Dodges they have out now has a uh the Cummins turbo diesel in it
 	
 	
 		oh i heard about that yes
 	
 	
 		ah it's beautiful that thing that thing will last forever i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's the that's a serious truck
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that thing's uh that it's got a boat engine in it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right this uh i i know a contractor who just got one of those and he's pleased with it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
