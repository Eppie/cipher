 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what sort of car are you interested in getting next
 	
 	
 		well actually i love the car i have i have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		and i love it and i would get another one in a minute unless i could afford what i really like which would be a red Ferrari or you know a little Corvette or something like that
 		and that's what would influence my decision to change because i like a really sporty car
 		and i'd love an expensive one but i probably can never afford it so
 	
 	
 		uh well i understand and can sympathize with that because i also enjoy driving performance automobiles
 		um i currently have an eighty seven five liter Mustang GT that i've done a bunch of modifications to to make it uh handle and perform better
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i suspect if i were to be able to get another car where object was um the best car i could get regardless of money  uh
 		i probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah well i'm a nurse here and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari
 	
 	
 		a a three twenty eight GTS
 	
 	
 		and i couldn't tell you but it's just beautiful and i go out and i love to touch it but i can't even do that because of the  of the alarm so i just look at it a lot
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		you just go hunting go out and lust after it
 	
 	
 		really exactly but it sure is a pretty thing
 	
 	
 		so have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari
 	
 	
 		no i'm working on it  no i really haven't no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i did test drive a Corvette last year maybe the year before it was brand new white it was like a big marshmallow when you sat in the seats they adjusted to fit around you
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		i mean they came in and up and out and i mean they did whatever and and we went for a test drive in that and i was able to open that up pretty good and that was really fun and i wanted it but i had a choice of that or my house
 	
 	
 		yeah there there's something about having a place to live i don't know
 	
 	
 		and i felt that i should continue to live in my house so
 		yeah you know it's just necessary and i did i thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but  probably not practical
 	
 	
 		could sleep in the back of the Vette
 	
 	
 		yeah right  so
 	
 	
 		i find that uh that the Corvettes are are becoming really really nice cars
 	
 	
 		they are they're pretty aren't they lately they really are
 	
 	
 		yeah and they've they've improved the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		it's not like driving a a Winnebago or something
 	
 	
 		oh no no no see i'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now and they go isn't that a nice van and i go hm
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		not really you know how about a Greyhound bus
 	
 	
 		uh nice yeah nice isn't the word i'd choose maybe practical isn't that a practical van
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean that you know there's some that are prettier than others and yeah the new type is prettier than what their they used to look like
 		but i sure don't think it's attractive you know it's not like like driving a little sports car
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think that happens so but i i love mine so and i i bought it because i drove a friend's in Hawaii
 		and i just went home and i walked in and i picked it out
 		and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to and i never did i just went back and signed the papers and i knew nothing about my car when i got it nothing i didn't know how anything worked
 	
 	
 		oh so it was a completely new experience for you and i'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it
 	
 	
 		yeah and i've had it it's almost three years actually and i've i still love it i put the top down everywhere i go i timed it when i first got it and it took twenty minutes i mean twenty seconds and so
 		i figured there was nowhere i was to late to go that i didn't have twenty more seconds
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		and you and you couldn't get how long does it take to go back up about the same time
 	
 	
 		twenty seconds yeah that's all it takes i mean it's just a button that's it you you release it right at the top so you don't have to get out or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 		so you won't get
 		yeah and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial
 	
 	
 		well i did actually last week going to the airport i just hit a downpour and i was on a highway going like eighty
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i really did i mean i was soaking wet i thought i would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over
 	
 	
 		whoops
 	
 	
 		but it all dried out you know didn't take long when the sun came out but   it was kind of funny i'm sure people around me really enjoyed it  so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh no i was just down in Austin last week and the weather was pretty nice too so
 	
 	
 		oh and wasn't it pretty last week with the bluebonnets and everything yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		with the bluebonnets out yeah it really was yeah i decided that Austin is certainly someplace that i could handle living
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of people say that and it's pretty far from where i live it's about hm two or three hours maybe two hundred
