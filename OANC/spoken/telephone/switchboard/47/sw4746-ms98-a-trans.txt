 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well mine is very very simple i'm a nurse  i wear white or i wear scrubs  so i guess you'll have to carry this one
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh you're all set then
 		
  
 		oh geez i i'm a teacher
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and uh basically what we do is we dress for the weather especially the climates inside the school
 	
 	
 		isn't it different it is different isn't it inside than
 	
 	
 		not so much they climates out
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh my daughter says that too that it's freezing when they turn on the air conditioning and it's so hot when they turn on the heat
 	
 	
 		
  
 		it is it's unbelievable usually we layer our clothing
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um that way we have you know we can strip off layers
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and not so much our pants but you wear a sweater and a short sleeve shirt underneath that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you can take the sweater off
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or something that's medium weight
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and especially up here we get the you know we get winters and it's really cold and sometimes in the classrooms it's really cold too
 	
 	
 		right
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so sometimes you just leave your jackets on all the time
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		you know so
 	
 	
 		yeah it's probably pays pays for you to leave something there do you do you do that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um not that often because a lot of things get stolen
 	
 	
 		
  
 		really
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		so  it's  mostly what you wear into work you know wear a short sleeve shirt or a short sleeve blouse
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and a sweater if you're wearing slacks and if you're wearing a over the dress you wear a sweater you know a cardigan or something over the dress
 		and um you know bring your jacket you can just carry it around with you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you can wear socks to work there
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yes we can and
 	
 	
 		yeah our teachers can't do that yet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well we have a really big high school so it's you know it gets very uncomfortable on hills
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		most the teachers have taking to wearing uh track shoes
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		oh  the nurses have too that's interesting a lot of them are wearing Reebok's now because most of them the prefer the pants to the dresses
 	
 	
 		you know sneakers and
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and with the scrubs too you know which is just you know scrubs are like what they wear in the O R and i
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		they just wear Reebok's it's really comfortable i haven't done it yet
 	
 	
 		
  
 		no
 	
 	
 		but it's probably coming because we're all going into scrubs right now it depends on the area where you work
 	
 	
 		they're great
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		but soon the whole area is going into scrubs and so um-hum
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh really
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so probably i'll go ahead and break down and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know i guess i guess from the school  this is just not professional you know  so i'm kind of a hold out
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 		oh that happens a lot i know my aunt was director she just retired was director of nurses at the hospital up here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and she always wore a cap and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh yeah she was like a real hold out
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and then finally she took that off and that was like big concession on her part
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then she went to her hospital you know her uniform
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and she always wore her you know uniform shoes never wore sneakers
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		she absolutely refused
 	
 	
 		yeah and i still do that and they're very expensive they are comfortable though i i don't know i
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah that's what she was saying
 		
  
 		one thing i've noticed that's come back here are clogs
 	
 	
 		
  
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah they started to make a come back you see them in the stores more and more and  i didn't think i'd ever see those again
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh i know it well in California they have these oh gosh i can't think of the name of them
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		they have a name they come from Italy and they're cork
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they have like two straps on top like a sandal and they form to fit your feet
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh neat
 	
 	
 		they're soft and after you wear them a day then they only fit your feet
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh that sounds great
 	
 	
 		and they're wearing those and i've seen a little bit of it in the stores here now
 	
 	
 		
  
 		really
 	
 	
 		but i don't know being up there if you'll see too much  they wouldn't be very practical except in the summer time
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um yeah that's the new thing and it's sort of on that style you know except that it's open like a sandal
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right a lot of us during the winter would wear boots and then peel them off and carry our shoes
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 		you know or just wear the shoes in and hope for the best
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		
  
 		hum things have plowed pretty well
 	
 	
 		i'm not used to that anymore i came down here from New York but
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yes i remember boots and things like that but not anymore
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 		uh-huh yeah my parents just came up from Florida and they had to get rid of all their a lot of their summer summer clothes
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they say my gosh one minute it's eighty and the next minute it's you know sixty and they're freezing  and they said oh what and they say wait a minute we had a mild winter this year
 	
 	
 		
  
 		really really
 		
  
 		oh oh wait till next year uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well hopefully we seem to be running on mild winters lately
 	
 	
 		
  
 		they weather's changing all over the country
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah we're getting a lot more rain and ice than we are snow
 	
 	
 		
  
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and uh that makes it difficult on as far as clothing goes because you don't know what to put on your feet
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think anyone in Texas owns
