 
     		
 	
 		up here in Rochester uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution i think Grand Rapids was number one
 		uh we really don't have too much of a problem as far as uh industry since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here
 		but we do have the same problem a lot of are other areas up here in the northeast have and that is the effects of acid rain
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		coming coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana
 	
 	
 		well that's that's that's true actually down here we don't have a big problem with uh with air pollution mainly because we don't have anybody to the either side of us
 		uh which helps out a lot as far as that goes
 		i wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when i lived up in Boston and up in uh you know debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and
 		you know in that area over uh air pollution and their attitude's basically well prevailing ins winds are to the east so why should we have to worry
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've uh was in Los Angeles once and that was quite a difference
 		as far as pollution goes i mean you couldn't really see that much  every once in a while we have these air inversions the weather
 	
 	
 		oh yes nothing
 	
 	
 		inversions and then it gets hazy around here but they're really we don't have a big problem with it
 		i think that uh what most of the people here in New York state are going after right now is it's it's the uh ongoing acid rain problem especially out in the uh uh Adirondack areas
 		where you know the lakes are becoming uh changing the acidity of the lakes and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants
 		uh or alkaline liking plants are just not lasting anymore because the soil levels the p H is changing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		as this acid rain continues to fall and i know that there's been battles over the states up here
 		uh you know Governor Mario going after you know governors of Ohio and  and Indiana to fix
 		what's going on down there i remember when i was in Florida the only problem was that it seemed like it may it wasn't really pollution just the steamy weather
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely yeah just muggy
 		so yes i think you're yeah i think you're right our most pollute substance down here is just water
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it
 	
 	
 		hey
 		i i i think you know the biggest causes though even then a lot of times are uh uh like when i was up in Boston just all the cars
 		you know all over the place you just got a lot of
 		you know a a lot of pollution from those and uh you know if you don't have a wind it sticks around
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i you know i was in Boston once and i remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour even with the tee
 		um just this it looked like billions of cars massing
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go i mean yeah that's what's in you know Los Angeles is i think that's biggest problem
 		because when i was in Los Angeles for a time it's all you know from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and there's really there's nowhere for this to be absorbed really
 		um tree planting sometimes can handle you know stopping some of the air pollution and that and help but if you have nowhere to do anything
 	
 	
 		that's that's very true
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh you know of course then when when you're not recycling you've got these incendiary plants and stuff that can be some pretty disgusting stuff
 		going up in the atmosphere
 		but i you know you've you've got you've got the industry you've got that and you got the cars and i think the cars are where where it's at right now as far as pollution goes
 		air air pollution i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah i you know Florida doesn't seem to be at least maybe Miami
 		but i i uh you know Fort Lauderdale i i don't know what the big industries are down there
 		uh but you know up here we have Kodak and that's the worst polluter they put uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you can smell ether in the air sometimes
 		keeps the neighborhoods happy i guess
 	
 	
 		i i guess so
 	
 	
 		uh cause they clean the uh
 		the lenses for cameras and they they make film here and they're the worst offender but you know sulphur dioxide is the big
 		emittant from them but that's really getting under control now
 	
 	
 		right i you know i i don't know in the air down here what they do uh
 		i i haven't run across any major pollutants down there that i i i've really seen a lot of
 		you know upsettedness about
 		uh
 		i i i know i've seen like uh my grandparents live in Corpus Christi Texas and i know they've there's a lot of refineries down there
 		and and that's that's some pretty potent stuff they can put up in the air
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i but i don't know how uh yeah there's a difference in what you can smell and what you uh you know what's bad
 	
 	
 		be interesting to see when as Mexico develops industrially whether you know without
