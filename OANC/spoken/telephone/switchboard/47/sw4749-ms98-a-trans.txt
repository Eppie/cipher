 
     		
 	
 		now um we're driving a nineteen eighty five uh Buick Park Avenue that's still on the road
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you must have a family
 	
 	
 		yeah  it's uh it it's an interesting car with all sorts of problems that crop up now that it's in it's seventh year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh like anytime anything happens it's immediately five hundred dollar repair or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		what have you so i uh you know in looking for the next car that we get here we're gonna look for something that has a very good track record that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		isn't going to cost us a bundle every time something goes wrong
 	
 	
 		well i can tell you about reliability the last two cars i've had have both been Honda Accords
 		and uh i mean it's probably it's not a huge car but it's been very reliable and uh i was just very impressed by it
 		uh when i first looked at it and when i talked to other people that had Hondas they cost a little more and when i was looking for them the dealer just wouldn't negotiate at all because they're such a big demand but
 		it had all the features i needed the uh you know the power and the uh adjustability and power windows and things like that
 		and the dashboard just looked good to me it was just no nonsense had the the speedometer uh speedometer and the tach and the couple of other little gauges like engine heat but none of the you know big flashy electronic stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've continually i've come to learn in having this car that it was fully loaded when we got it and the problem is it's the fully loaded gives the car more chances for things to go wrong
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that make it not drivable and  i'd heard good things about the Hondas uh especially the Accord um
 		but uh you know we've been we've been we've been an American car family for the most part for um a long time not because of any great desire to like wow we're just going to buy American because it's American
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but but i don't know it's just been traditional type of uh General Motors type of car the last car we had was a um
 		um a Grand Prix which never again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that was a nightmare that one that i mean the thing just literally fell apart as time went on
 	
 	
 		God well it's well if you like American cars it's a good thing that they're getting better i'll tell you that you
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's been you know the the Park Avenue this year that's come out you know being a very high end type car uh they put a lot into it this year but the one in eighty five
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		apparently was a problem year for them because
 		they you know what's happened is most people have just gotten rid of them as soon as you know they pass the three year mark and things start going they go and buy a new car
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well with the Northeast and the recession up here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that's certainly not an easy option and  uh we've kind of stuck with it trying to keep it you know we figure sooner or later we'll probably replace everything on the silly thing and
 	
 	
 		maybe it'll work right then huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i know know then when one of the doors fall off then it's time to get a new car you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		great yeah well Chrysler is supposed to be when if you're looking at reliability Chrysler's supposed to be one of the best American cars right now
 		and the American cars the uh one advantage one advantage one big advantage they still have is you can typically find them for a lot less
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so anyway but uh
 		some of the other things i like about well some of the things i don't like usually are um the flashy stuff you know the all the doors lock when you do something or uh um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i used to now i'm getting more to where i think i might like a a sun roof on my next car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm not really sure about that because i'm very much a person who uh likes to drive around with every with all the windows closed and the air conditioning on so i can hear my stereo well
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but you know so a sun roof or or a tee top or something like that you're just going to have to crank the stereo up to compete with the wind noise
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you're in a climate that's a little bit more  where you have need the air conditioning more than we do up here
 	
 	
 		you bet they don't sell any cars down here without it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah see up here it's it's definitely definitely an option type thing because we only have about three months of really hot weather
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		everything else is fairly moderate then we have the world famous Rochester slash Buffalo winters
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so a sun roof is really a snow roof you know ooh look snow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah great
 	
 	
 		i mean i think what else you're going to see you know  looking up at your doom as the snow comes pummeling down but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		well that's the other thing is a car needs to be able to handle the salt up here that they pour on the roads
 	
 	
 		that's right right
 	
 	
 		and that's what kills cars up here is you know the salt rusts them out and then they die years before you you know a car from California might be undrivable
 	
 	
 		right or or they they die of rust years before their major systems would otherwise go out
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's what happened basically to our last car i mean it just this rust took over and
