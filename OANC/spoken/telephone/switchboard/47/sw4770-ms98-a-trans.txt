 
     		
 	
 		uh i don't know my personal perception of government and uh the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to uh be self-serving to the community i think that they have their own uh wishes to uh be in the limelight
 		and to kind of say hey you know i'm a public official i don't have to do uh certain things and they just stand out more involving themselves more and more with politics but
 		uh it's really after all the things that i've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts uh of checks uh before that it was the wonderful uh
 		escapade that they had with uh the new uh oh God chief of uh well Supreme Court i'm trying to think of his name and uh what they put uh him through in regards to yeah Thomas
 	
 	
 		Thomas
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the sex the sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that
 		i i just think it's very corrupt and whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor and send them into government versus people that are rich
 		but it's always the rich person that gets into government that has uh the money to advertise the money to do to do this there's no more Abe
 		Abraham Lincolns out there uh that can get into government even if they were poor
 		so i know that's my personal viewpoint of things
 	
 	
 		doesn't Wisconsin have a uh state uh Medicare program or health program
 	
 	
 		now they just uh they've already put through the health bill  yes it just went through and it was passed
 		and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpayers taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical uh
 		i don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people you know what i'm saying it it's
 		right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health uh system
 		and of course they think uh Wisconsin our neighbor or Minnesota our neighbor passed a state law the health bill
 		and it's kind of like we're the first to do it so i don't know if it's done because we're we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh
 		you know a real good purpose to help people that can't afford uh health insurance that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i i think the one of the biggest problems that uh we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh sure
 	
 	
 		and that is uh uh we become so debt ridden and credit oriented
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		uh instead of uh cash and carry or debt free  and therefore uh that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities state and federal governments
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it it sure does and i think it it is reflecting like you said i think society as a whole
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh you can't expect uh when we have TVs and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for uh you know immorality and this and this and this that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be clean
 		totally clean  and come into government uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but down the line it does hurt i mean when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something it's uh you know it does hurt
 		the each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or you know the other things that have occurred so uh
 	
 	
 		well what is see the thing is is when a lot of things become acceptable practice uh it's hard to discern the border what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical and then someone blows the whistle and says
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		oh this is not ethical and yes i did it too
 	
 	
 		yeah  well that's exactly what happens in government  all the time hey blow the whistle on each other oh i hear that you're doing this i've done it but oh boy  and it's not going to get out exactly yeah exactly exactly it's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah we just had a
 	
 	
 		there's no secrets in the government uh i don't think anymore
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right the mayor of Dallas is uh Bartlett Steve Bartlett he also uh was a congressman
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh to the uh to Congress and he had been in that position for years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and uh he was elected mayor of Dallas overwhelmingly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		however if the vote was taken today the whole thing might change because he was part of that
 		uh check kiting scam
 	
 	
 		oh sure  i think i i don't think uh
