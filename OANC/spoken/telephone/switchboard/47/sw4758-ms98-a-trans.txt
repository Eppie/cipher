 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i'm are you there
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		okay i'm sure that i probably um prescribe to different magazines ones that you do  i take Doll Reader and Doll World
 		because
 	
 	
 		different set
 	
 	
 		because i collect dolls  um i also take Better Homes and Gardens
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i like that and then uh my husband he just uh subscribed to a wood he just started a woodwork so he just sent away to get some woodworking books
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so what kind do you uh get
 	
 	
 		you know
 		well i have a bunch of computer journals because i'm in computer science but beyond that uh lately i've been reading i've always liked the New Yorker
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and lately i've been picking up some of the travel uh both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um trying to keep up on what's going on
 	
 	
 		is it
 	
 	
 		and my wife also gets a lot of the food magazines Bon Appetite and Food and Wine and Gourmet
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to take that right
 	
 	
 		yeah and she and she still likes to get Time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which i've never liked very much but she seems to
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i if i you know if if i happen to find it i'll go ahead and read it someplace you know if i'm in a doctor's office or something like that but other than that i never i never liked that really
 	
 	
 		do you read a newspaper
 	
 	
 		i read my newspaper i can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper to get here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so i do like to read the newspaper
 		um  and even this little newspaper that Patterson puts out in fact it it puts it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays i can hardly wait to get that to get the local news
 		but uh other than that
 		magazines i don't know there's so much advertising in them anymore
 	
 	
 		
 
 		some of them i used to get for the advertising like Byte magazine which is uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		one of the larger computer ones
 		i haven't bought it now for about eight years but when i used to get it it was about five hundred pages about three hundred of them advertising
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		huh
 	
 	
 		because that was interesting i think a lot of the trade magazines are like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		that that half the fun is finding out what all the products are
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you know some of the get ridiculous Travel and Leisure all of the American Express magazines
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so Travel and Leisure Food and Wine and i think they have some others uh certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it is it's clear that i i've bought some of these  through wholesalers  and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription they're making everything on ads
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 		yeah well i i only you know subscribe to the things that i'm interested in i used to be into coin collecting so i used to get the coin magazine the paper actually is what it was you know
 		i used to get that so now that i'm into dolls that's about
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		all i really really want you know
 	
 	
 		have you ever um read or subscribe to Consumer Reports for any length of time
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 		um
 		i think they're interesting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but not worth it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i've always had this one of the reasons i like to to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've always had this problem with Consumer Reports that in the areas that i know a lot about i disagree with them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or or what's going on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i've like i've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent uh organization magazines and
 		it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective
 		um you know their major interest is in commissions and
 		you know there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines their major talk is about you know commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a the full ten percent or whatever it is and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it gives you a different perspective on what people do
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum well those travel magazines are that more or less show you different countries that you could go to or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh some of them the the general travel magazines do i don't tend to read it for that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i don't expect to be traveling overseas in in the future for quite awhile but i i usually just read through the sections on on domestic stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum okay well i don't know any other magazines i could talk to you about
 		um
 		i don't take anymore than that
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah i don't take in much more in myself
 	
 	
 		you know so
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well i guess that will be it then  and
 	
 	
 		okay nice talking to you
