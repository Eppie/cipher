 
     		
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a lot of companies now are are using uh drug testing uh paraphernalia and drug testing situations to to root out the the either uh
 		yeah elementary or intermediate or advanced uh drug users
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i know that that government is uh you know gives drug tests uh to all new entrants all new applicants applicants coming into government
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and i quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it i i'm guess i'm not a good civil libertarian
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and i i feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you are a drug user you have a hidden agenda
 		that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background of course we're  being involved in my organization uh we we have deep background checks and
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		and so uh but but you but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that
 		and uh i have absolutely no compunction about uh using any and all means to to uh uh you know work out figure out who has a drug program or has a drug problem
 	
 	
 		hm
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh and putting that guy into into therapy to
 		or whatever it is to to you know break this uh uh activity of course if he's fallen in love with drugs
 		and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems be meaningful
 		then maybe there is no hope
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what's your uh feeling
 	
 	
 		um well i guess i i guess i'm probably a little more toward toward the other direction um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i guess mainly because um
 		it's i well like there's two sides to it i guess um one is that um if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever
 		or you know even if it's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then
 		i i think that that you know i don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot
 		um but i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business
 		um and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go
 		you know we had prohibition for awhile and then we didn't have prohibition
 		um  you know we've had i guess laws against uh
 		you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess maybe a little longer
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i think uh the drug the laws on uh uh uh the first morphine laws were were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah well so eighty eighty eighty years or so yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um so i you know it's it's hard to i guess for me to justify what seems seems like you know basically a breach of the First Amendment you know
 		freedom from uh search and seizure you you know um on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten who knows
 	
 	
 		well the thing of it is the the that that that that is uh uh in in many respects uh
 	
 	
 		i mean prohibition certainly didn't last
 	
 	
 		uh you know just just a i think an over simplification i i think there there the the there's so much criminal activity
 	
 	
 		well but you got to look at prohibition though you had the same problems there right
 	
 	
 		uh that that people go into to to support drug habit
 		yeah you know they they support drug habits with uh with uh you you know with things like uh you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah sure well it goes back to the again if you look at prohibition i mean because it's illegal it costs more if it was legal i mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i must admit that
 	
 	
 		and clearly if you're into Coke and all you wanna do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap and you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah get um
 	
 	
 		yeah i i must must admit that the the production costs of of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and the
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well that's why there's you know why there's people dealing it because there's money in it you know there's a ridiculous amounts of money in it
 	
 	
 		and the costs to society yeah
 		but i i i i think that that the that you know the  being in law enforcement you know is that that  i'm i probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it and but but the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i i really feel as though the interdiction effort is is as soon as you you get rid of one goon that's that's that's involved in drugs  yeah and then another another one will jump up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah interdiction's hopeless
 		i mean there's no way you're ever gonna win that
 	
 	
 		but we we see
 	
 	
 		the tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up so the more incentive there is i mean that's a losing fight
 	
 	
 		yeah as as as as as soon as we we wind up uh uh you know uh
 		well i think if we could just destroy the market by destroying the demand but but people will wanna get get stoned and i i don't see that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well yeah it goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people i mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen i don't think you can i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i'm you know was raised with the very strong Bible work ethic so you know i'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you know yeah i i can really relate to yeah everybody ought to do their own share you know i don't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or or that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you know
