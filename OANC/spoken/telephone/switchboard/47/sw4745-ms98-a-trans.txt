 
     		
 	
 		um i don't know about you but uh i work outside the home and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in fact uh i'll be leaving very shortly to go to work and i work different shifts so are pretty much a
 		a later shift to where i don't have the family time uh when my husband gets home it's usually he's home with my daughter alone and then uh couple of hours later i'm home
 		um i don't know i'm finding that more and more people that i talk to there's less and less family time available to them and uh it seems that business wise um
 		in the business community or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family
 		so you know if you do have any time it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done
 		um just just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then plus try to have that relationship with your children
 		and it it's sometimes a very it's a it's a very hard juggling act
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		and
 		you know i look at my daughter and she's now uh four going to be four and i keep saying oh jeez i don't have that much time with her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and she's growing fast and
 	
 	
 		i know that i have three children and um i stay home i don't work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um i know that it it must be really challenging to um try to juggle a job and and also your children because i know my husband if i were gone as much as he is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we wouldn't have the influence on them that i would wanna put on them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure exactly
 	
 	
 		and i also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to day care every day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they don't like to be around adults
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they don't wanna play around adults they don't want to be around you they don't want you to tell them what to do they want to do their own thing and they're the very same age as my children
 	
 	
 		sure
 		um-hum exactly
 	
 	
 		and i'm finding as i volunteer up at the school
 		i just a being um i'm not educated at all in um really detecting this but i can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after i've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to day care and which kids stay home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		and you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults
 		that um the ones that are are home and the ones even that are home that are getting the love and attention they need
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		not that the kids that go out aren't getting that it's just a different they're they are more used to being with their own age kids they're not use to being with adults and to responding to adults
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		sure
 		sure
 		sure yeah i agree to a
 	
 	
 		um i think the trend in the United States i feel really bad that it's turned so much to where the children are um
 	
 	
 		i think so too
 		in fact um i spent the first three years at home with my daughter so i i guess i felt fairly fortunate that i was able to do that and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in day care and i thought to myself how can a mother
 		place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks whatever the employer says you have to be back to work is basically when you have to be back to work whether it be six weeks or three or four but how these women must
 		feel to place their children into care and you know it's our society saying yes this um you need this job
 		it's a little bit financial type thing because uh if you look all over in the other countries like Europe and that um their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are and that's part of it too but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties uh were staying at home with their kids
 		and then made the decision well jeez you know i'll go out and get a part time job got a part time job and then financially they got themselves into well i'll have the boat i'll have the car and it's nice
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and really women past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too
 		uh because it is now our financial situations are as
 		it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now and
 	
 	
 		it's hard it really is hard i know that my husband and i have to do a lot of sacrificing to keep me home and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure i did it for three years and uh it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it
 		and pretty soon you know you're at the limit where you've got to say okay you've sacrificed for you know so many years at home and you're not getting any further you know along
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you have to make that decision to go back to work part time or go back to work full time and you have to make that decision and it's a tough one and i
 	
 	
 		right i think one of the things that people look at too though is um spending how they spend their time with their children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think with working moms if you can get the managers the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year round school where you work
 	
 	
 		sure
