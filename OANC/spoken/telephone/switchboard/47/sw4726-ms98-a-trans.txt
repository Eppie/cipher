 
     		
 	
 		i'm ready if you are
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay um where uh where do you stand uh
 	
 	
 		well i think that people should be allowed to have them especially if they go hunting which my son goes hunting he goes deer hunting he goes duck hunting
 	
 	
 		on
 		oh you
 	
 	
 		uh he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i just think that uh as far as that's concerned he should be able to have them to go hunting with you know as far as just having handguns around to
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		to have them i don't believe that you should have handguns around
 	
 	
 		right yeah yeah yeah i agree too i um
 		it's it's as far as uh the ban goes and everything i don't think it's possible uh to completely ban guns there's just too many
 	
 	
 		well no there's too many sports people out there that that do do these things
 	
 	
 		right and i  yeah right i mean yeah that that's true and i mean the the technology's not that hard i mean you could make a gun you know from simple you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well i suppose you could uh
 	
 	
 		you know if if you really wanted a gun you could you could make one um
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i think if they want one they're going to get one you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah sure that's true
 	
 	
 		the bad guys are you know like i say if they want a gun they're going to find out or somehow to get one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah it's yeah i mean there's yeah there's there's no way to stop uh stop anybody from getting a gun um
 		i think there should be more control as like uh like maybe waiting periods and things like that you know uh
 	
 	
 		well i agree with you on that because i know uh in fact i had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time and for a rifle there's no waiting there wasn't anyhow now there might be now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but there wasn't anything for you know rifles and things like that i guess it was just handguns that there was a some kind of a waiting you know a two weeks while they checked you out or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh most of these people that's got these guns that's going around you know robbing people and shooting people
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah uh i i know my friend is uh really into guns and uh
 		uh we have went a couple of times with him to gun shows you know they come through town and everything and i mean they just have i mean they have anything you'd want i mean you know you know uh you know anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there's i mean there's nothing you can just go buy one and take it home and you know it's easier than getting uh like a video membership card at you know a video store
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i see now i know they were having a gun show uh about a month ago and i was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah you just go and uh buy the gun and uh
 	
 	
 		there's no restriction though you don't have to wait or nothing then huh
 	
 	
 		no well except for the the pistols and i i'm not sure how they do that i know they used
 	
 	
 		yeah i was just curious you know because uh i know at at the regular gun show you know gun shop that you that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks and then they check you out then they call you up and you have go pick it up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right
 		yeah i think that's
 	
 	
 		which i think they have to do on rifles and things now too i think there is something something like that anyhow here out here in California i think there is now  but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah i'm not sure i'm not really sure but what uh the the gun laws in uh Pennsylvania Pennsylvania are like
 	
 	
 		um-hum  no  we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that but like i say my son he's
 	
 	
 		no
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he's always had a like a i think his first little rifle we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but he's always he went to the to the school to learn how to shoot it he goes to the pistol range and uh and the rifle range to shoot them he likes to go to that uh shotgun thing where you shoot at those um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the skeets you mean
 	
 	
 		yeah right he likes to do that you know  but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i think they should try to control it and everything you know but as far as just banning it completely there that's not going to happen
 	
 	
 		i don't yeah i don't i don't think it can happen either it i just don't i don't see and i i think uh hadn't thought about this before but if you do that if they would uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh decide to ban guns it would just open up a a market you know a black market for them
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		and so you know they they would just all the profits would go to you know
 	
 	
 		now i do believe though like in California if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has i think they're liable now for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh the
 	
 	
 		they can be you know put in jail and everything the whoever owned the gun
 	
 	
 		oh  the owner's responsibility yeah
 	
 	
 		you know now when they have kids around you'd think that they would be locking them up or you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah that's that's true um you know i had i had a friend who was a uh
 		a policeman in a in a in a local borough just a small uh
 		one of the little neighborhoods you know one of the small towns uh near Pittsburgh and uh she said  that uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that but i mean you know you're you know people make you know they forget or you know you know kids get in the way kids the way kids are you know i mean they can
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		well they can get into almost anything anymore
 	
 	
 		right yeah
