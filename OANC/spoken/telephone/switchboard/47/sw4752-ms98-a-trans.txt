 
     		
 	
 		i'm ready
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well in Atlanta Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson California
 	
 	
 		oh could could be
 	
 	
 		uh this little city is only about eight thousand people
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah we is is crime a problem there do you like a major problem minor problem or
 	
 	
 		well in Patterson there's it's not a problem here but like uh i lived in Oakland uh until just recently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh Oakland California God they've had like uh sixty seven murders so far this year compared to like uh forty at this time last year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's really bad there  it's all related to drugs it seems like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		is that what it's there too
 	
 	
 		yeah um i've only been here for like oh probably just over six months i started started school here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i came from a smaller town in in New York and crime the city was fairly big size or not real big but we had a problem there but here it's just no comparison that much more crime uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		every every night the news is very depressing because it just you know they run down the list of how many people were shot you know drive by shootings or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whatever and it's it's it's pretty bad they're they're it's things are basically improved here over the last few years they've the they've actually taken steps to try to make it better but it still it still is a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah Like i don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen
 	
 	
 		well that's
 		that seemed to be what they were doing and it has and they've started stepped up more patrols in certain areas and it has has made some places safer but you you know it's very difficult i mean if you don't have an infinite amount of money to to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		as it is a is definitely a problem and you know the more it more less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread even to smaller areas unfortunately
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		well i i think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands and you know then then maybe those other people would be kind of scared and they would not do these bad things you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i think i think uh it's uh seems to be that
 		i don't know some people they tend they do something you know they shoot somebody or whatever they go to jail
 		sentenced to jail for like thirty years they're out in five and they're back on the street and then they shoot someone else and just cyclical cyclical cyclical and it seems seems as though the the system doesn't  tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done
 	
 	
 		yeah i just don't understand our our laws here because you know like in other countries man i mean they're really a lot stricker than we are
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's definitely true it seems seems as though we we try to play humanitarian i think to a little to much and maybe some of the people don't deserve the the humanitarian treatment that they get
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		unfortunately but i don't know it's a difficult situation i think and
 		some something has to be done because i definitely think it's it it really
 		plays reeks havoc with uh your quality of life when you know you can see it's going on around you but then when once it finally affects you then then it really starts to bother you
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		but
 		it seems i mean it people move like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out but you know it's only a matter of time before you know it still catches up with them you can't really run away from the problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and something you know something has to be done but
 		it's just that too many people argue about how to fix it
 	
 	
 		yeah i know when i lived in Oakland it was just that uh like i definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of of the city by myself
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		and uh and then then again some areas i wouldn't go by myself after dark
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but down here in Patterson
 		well like i say it's so small that you can go anywhere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's good
 	
 	
 		but just uh like twenty miles away see in Modesto they have uh those gangs and things over there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it's it's bad in Sacramento also they have uh drive by shootings it seems like all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't know i just i just don't know what what they can do you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's it's to bad because it's um i mean
 		the just the even the random occurrences where you know it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from their car to the some in certain areas like from from the car from their car to the mall or something and it's dangerous and it's just that's just ridiculous and
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		you know it's just uh it's just not right something you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean like even even going to the grocery store i know we've had this one lady that was attacked you know i mean just uh you just you just don't know what to do anymore you know
 	
 	
 		right right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and some of the times it's happening in the daytime too you know so it's not always happening at dark
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh
 		definitely unfortunate unfortunate and
 		it just
