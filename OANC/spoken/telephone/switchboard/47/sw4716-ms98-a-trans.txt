 
     		
 	
 		okay um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten i guess i would rate it a five in the aspect that i wouldn't want everybody to have guns
 		and i think there should be limitations of like semiautomatics uh things like that should not be just given out to anybody In fact you know i can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose
 		um
 		so i guess you know being that i come from a hunting family i'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but yet allow hunting rifles uh things that people would use for sporting type of uh uh activity those would be fine but when you get into um
 		a lot of the more complex weapons i would say yes we need to put restrictions on them
 	
 	
 		um that's probably i probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way i think um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i definitely think that there some things shouldn't be limited like like you said rifles and um hunting rifles and probably handguns for people who use them to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		exactly for for self protection sure
 	
 	
 		right and but i think the i think  semiautomatic weapons people say they use them because it for sport but i i
 		personally cannot see any use for them other than uh for for for only like people who just like have some sort of crazed
 	
 	
 		i can't imagine that yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know ambition to use have high powered weapons or something
 	
 	
 		to do massive amounts of killing uh yeah
 	
 	
 		right and i mean you can only how much do you want
 	
 	
 		the only thing i can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is uh
 		uh you know going to kill a massive amount of people or uh somebody that's escaping that's uh very dangerous
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch a person and and uh get him down but um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know i i think of my family uh they're very much into sporting and uh you know as far as hunting and also like uh clay pigeons
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		things like that so they have may have some shotguns they may have other types of uh hunting type things but i figured if the if the criminals had to take a hunting gun
 		out to kill somebody more than likely somebody would see it you know what i'm saying versus a
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		you know a small handgun um that can be you know put right in your coat pocket and nobody would see it but yet you can't stop people from having you know a handgun in their home
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		right
 	
 	
 		even if there are small children around there's you know you can't say people with small children can't have guns and people without small children that may have grandchildren you know still have these guns but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		um i guess i i was always taught number one a gun isn't a toy
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um you know and i don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sits down to them and say this gun can kill you know and don't ever play with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		um so i don't know if that makes a difference or what but
 	
 	
 		well i think partly uh in that case i think that cases like that it's definitely um i think
 		if you're to say okay we have to get rid of them all because you know they can only they only seem to do bad it it's um it's saying we're too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		but criminals would get them i mean even if they had to go across borders to get them
 	
 	
 		right right and people who people who have them and are responsible with them are are are being punished and people who
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're saying that people you cannot take care of things yourself or like that you're not smart enough to teach your kids how to how to uh
 	
 	
 		how to use you know to make sure that guns are put up as something as uh not a toy yeah because we had guns all over our house when we were kids and not that they were laying on the uh couch or anything like that but um
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		i never had an interest in them being in the fact that i knew that guns could kill and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and of course we were quite young and we went through uh the National Rifle uh Club and so we were taught
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know kind of at a a good age ten and eleven and twelve to sit down with a kid and say okay if you gonna learn how to shoot a gun you're going to learn how to do it correctly and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and know how to protect yourself but yet have this you know training so that kids aren't you know they have to have a certain respect for it
 	
 	
 		right well i think i mean we i grew up in a family and and my father had two guns because he used to hunt years ago but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 	
 	
 		stopped before really before i was old enough to remember but and i knew we had the guns in the house and the the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure yeah
 	
 	
 		but we it was never my brothers and sisters nor i never i mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun or let's go get the gun out it was just something you knew was there and the it was your father's and you you that was not something you'd go and play played with at all
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think maybe uh and that's the type of the thing that should be you know stressed
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so and and i don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what i i can't explain
