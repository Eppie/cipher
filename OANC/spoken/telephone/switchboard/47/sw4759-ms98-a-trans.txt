 
     		
 	
 		okay uh we keep a monthly budget i just recently stopped working so i can be home with my kids  so we keep a a monthly budget and we try to stick to it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know it's really it's really difficult here all because there's always something breaking car needs tires or you know something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's that's the kind of things that throw you off
 	
 	
 		uh uh we we do ours more monthly than long range um
 		we uh my husband gets paid once a month and when he gets paid i pay all the bills
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and out of his check they take a savings and out of my check they take savings
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and retirement both out of both checks so as far as extra savings we really don't have that much extra to save um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		his check once a month pays all the bills my check weekly buys groceries and gas and you know that kind of thing and it works out real well that way so we don't run into a lot of problems
 	
 	
 		oh how nice
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but budgets are horrible
 	
 	
 		well
 		i know we do my husband gets paid twice a week and so we pay all of the little bills uh one paycheck and then like the mortgage and the electric bill you know those big bills the second
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		second pay and then um again he does have a savings that comes out you know for Christmas and stuff that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah when the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them well send me some money
 	
 	
 		yeah that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah  it uh it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings
 	
 	
 		but it's nice that's there you know
 	
 	
 		but we do yeah it i'm just glad that it is there for car insurance medical bills whatever happen but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah it's nice that it's there
 	
 	
 		i know but i you it's just really is difficult uh neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and of course the cost of living keeps going up so my groceries are outrageous and i keep saying my check does less and less but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah that's kind of how i felt when i was working because it seemed like we spent more we bought more things and it seemed like we spent more then a lot of it was going to uh day care and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it just seems like with me staying home we had that big cut but we save more  i don't know how and i don't know why but we it seems like we do
 	
 	
 		well i uh i know that since i do work i buy a lot of quicker
 		cuts of meat and uh well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that and i'll stop by the deli and pick up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you kind of try and buy bigger quantities
 	
 	
 		uh chicken or whatever where if i did not work i'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot a lot uh better
 	
 	
 		yeah that's how i felt too it just you could take a little longer and just watch a little bit more i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		well you
 	
 	
 		i guess that's kind of like the way we do we i i don't i don't know how it comes it just seems like we save a little bit more whereas where i was working
 	
 	
 		well i'm sure you do um i do not  well i do not have to pay child care during the winter my son's old enough that he likes to come home
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh from school but in the summer he's still young enough that i cannot leave him by himself so in the summer i have that extra and ours is seventy dollars a week plus
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		all activities and that's usually movies one day skating on day swimming one day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		and it adds up
 	
 	
 		yeah so you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week and that's a lot of money
 	
 	
 		yeah it is  it is yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know if they're gonna be in day care then they need to have some activities other than just being there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how do you have two children
 	
 	
 		i have two one is four and a half and the other one's two and a half
 	
 	
 		well they're expensive too uh  just the outgrowing of their clothes so i'm sure the budget
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 		yeah that yeah i just came back to find jeans for the little one and it does add up yeah but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and medical bill
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		although the insurance we had was good uh when Thomas was younger a lot of the stuff had to be paid up front
 		and then you were reimbursed so it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the insurance but in the meantime you had to put out the money first
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that that's that's hard but i'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that i can
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah it is
 		oh i would too i would i would advise anyone that could possibly do it to to
 	
 	
 		for the
 		i know it's not forever and that's what's so sad but
 	
 	
 		well you probably wouldn't wanna do it forever i don't know though when
