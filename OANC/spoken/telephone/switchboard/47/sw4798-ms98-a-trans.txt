 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		anyway i guess there was just somebody recently down there wasn't today in Texas was it or there was uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm not
 	
 	
 		put to death
 	
 	
 		uh i'm not sure there was the big one uh earlier in the week in uh California that on on and off and on and off  um
 	
 	
 		um in California yeah
 		yeah so how do you feel about it
 		about capital punishment
 	
 	
 		i i don't know i'm  i'm uh mixed views on it i don't i don't
 		think that it really does much good as it as a deterrent uh the old thing in in terms of uh the the the uh biggest day for pickpockets was at the when they were hanging pickpockets but in public but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh on the other hand it it the it seems like that there just aren't are uh
 		some crimes and and some lives that that that there's no other at least emotional reaction to it what about you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i've you know i i kind of like you there's certain certain crimes that i think it fits i'm for it generally speaking i think the thing that bugs me the most about it is that
 		the process itself gets so drug out and so
 		you know i understand you need to prove without a shadow of a doubt that the guilt and whatnot but the appeal process of it i think is what really bugs me if you're gonna make it go so long you know what's the use of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it almost becomes more more cost you know to much cost and more trouble than it's worth you know to to put somebody like that to death or something that you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		rather than just sentence him to life and forget all the hassle you don't have to pay the attorneys all those fees they get and whatnot because i feel like you know sometimes it gets too drug out but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think i am i am basically for it with if you know if the crime of course fits it because some of those people this you got to wonder will they ever do anything i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right that that there's just
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh the time just comes that pure and simple you know you got to wonder if they're just a plain and simple menace to society or they gonna
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right
 	
 	
 		ever reform but
 	
 	
 		right well now does does uh uh
 		Utah have capital punishment
 	
 	
 		yes we do uh-huh and i and it's been a couple there was a oh it's been about fourteen years now there was a pretty hideous murder
 		in a hi-fi shop where they murdered one person and they they the two people that did it they poured Drano down one guy's throat and they kicked a pen through another guy's ear and and all kinds of things like that and and of course a couple of them ended up dying and a couple didn't but
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		ah one of the kid one of the two men involved was uh was was uh put to death oh about two years ago and and like i said if it took about thirteen years for it to happen and the other guy is still sitting on death row you know fourteen fifteen years later
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's why you know like i say a part of my thing with the whole appeal process kind of bugs me because here they have sat for you know fifteen years and i i wonder about the families of the people who are the victims you know and they've got to be a little bit upset themselves and
 	
 	
 		yeah that that that's it and uh that that  it if it's gonna happen it seems like there there there's some sort of closure when it when it's over and done with i know that was one of that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		aspects that covered the sequel to the case in California was was both it this is the first one in twenty five years and they've got something like over three hundred  on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		death row but the other thing was whether you know the family of the victims uh one of the fathers of the boys i think in California but you know wanted to be there to to witness it and it didn't feel like the whole thing was over and that's been fourteen years too i think  and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's true yeah they uh
 		uh oh i forgot i lost my point but yeah that's like i say i think the the victims and just if that's gonna happen they they just wanna have it done and over with but you know i agree there's got to be some appeal process because
 		it's almost you you wanna make sure in that situation that the person really did commit the crime uh you wanna give him every opportunity you possible can but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's the that's the thing here in here in here in Texas we've had a couple of cases in the last  one one was a was a murder case where it was
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		at this point it's fairly obvious that it was a that a a girl was killed at a high school and it was pretty obvious that the
 		police just picked out the black janitor and and uh set him up for it and uh he really didn't have anything to do with it and they  that certainly makes you think again again and yeah yeah  and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's that's the scary part especially something like this
 		i know in uh you know this California case the uh the Civil Liberty or ACLU i guess the American Civil Liberty you know they were doing anything they could to prevent it even to going as far as uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know stating the gas chamber is not uh as cruel or is cruel and unusual punishment and in such that they just drag up any little thing they possible can to drag it out or or whatnot you know i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well now in uh in Utah what's the method it is it firing squad or what huh
 	
 	
 		they use firing squad is is what's used a firing squad yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i was thinking  wasn't there a a big case
