 		uh-huh
 		oh you like the motels oh oh well
 	
 	
 		we have we've gone past the camping stage we lived in Chattanooga Tennessee for two years and we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys and it was beautiful and our kids loved it and everything and then we moved to uh
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 	
 	
 		uh the Dallas area and uh it's hot down here and camping's not near as much fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh so and then the kids were getting older and and uh were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh although our son loves to fish and uh and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
