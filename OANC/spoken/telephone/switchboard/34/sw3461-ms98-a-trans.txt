 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i guess when i think of camping i think of going out and setting up a tent and
 		and uh cooking out and that kind of thing what do you think of it as
 	
 	
 		well yeah that's exactly what i think of too when
 		that's the way i think of camping in a tent
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		not comfortably
 	
 	
 		well i know we used to do that when our children were younger and uh we could uh
 		we even had it fixed up where we could setup a tent and have a have supper ready in about thirty minutes
 		so it worked out real well for us then have you ever done that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's great well when i was a kid my father had all different kinds of travel trailers
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		whatever he liked he had a travel trailer and he had a Winnebago and he had a truck camper and
 		he was always buying new things like that and i hated it i i hated going camping and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		when when i got older i liked things like Caesar's Palace you know that's where i like to stay and and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  and oh okay you can't you're gonna camp out at Caesar's Palace huh
 	
 	
 		uh right exactly so this summer um my boyfriend lives in California
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		and he loves to go camping and he said let's go camping and i went
 		and i loved it  and so my my parents couldn't believe it you went camping  but it was nice it's peaceful and quiet and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		different perspective
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was just nice and i sat there and thought what do i have at home that i need that i don't have here  and i couldn't really think of anything so
 	
 	
 		right
 		now where did what kind of country did you go camping in
 	
 	
 		in California in the mountains
 	
 	
 		oh yeah now that's so peaceful
 	
 	
 		it was just beautiful and um it wasn't very crowded it was during the week and it was just wonderful
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that was nice  so i guess i do like camping
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think it depends on probably as a child you didn't feel that you left your friends at home and you didn't like there's much to do
 	
 	
 		right that's exactly right boring to me
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		what kind of places did your parents go to when they camped in the trailers
 	
 	
 		oh they went all over
 	
 	
 		just uh various parks and things
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean they they even moved they did they went to parks like um well we lived on Long Island and
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		we went to New Jersey and things like that you know not far away and then to the extreme um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they sold everything and bought a house trailer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh moved
 		to Florida  and pulled it behind us and that was really funny because i mean it's funny now it wasn't funny then an all these very strange things happened i mean it was just really
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		no
 		hm
 		well let's see Wildwood in New Jersey did you go there
 	
 	
 		i think they said
 		yes yes we did  that's exactly where we went
 	
 	
 		aha
 		i thought you might i understand that's a very popular place if you live in that area
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah lots of uh my husband was raised in Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh some of his friends had always talked about and what got me they never went anywhere on vacation but to Wildwood
 	
 	
 		and did they camp out probably
 	
 	
 		i
 		i'm you know i'm they'd go to the go to the shore go to the shore and we said you know really there are other places in the world
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah i wouldn't like to go to the same place all the time
 	
 	
 		but
 		hum-um but they we have these friends he went to high school with that they go to the same place every year and have for the last twenty years
 	
 	
 		yeah that's boring to me too
 	
 	
 		well
 		i you know i guess it's fine if they like it but i like to move around a little bit
 	
 	
 		well there's so many places to go you if you went to a different one every time you couldn't see them all so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's true and they each have their own special beauty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have you ever been um up to uh Lake Texoma here in Texas uh Texas
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that's pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they have a a park up there uh Eisenhower Park have you been there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i have it's been a long long time though
 	
 	
 		now that's where one place our children used to like to go
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now they like to go out and fish and things like that and course they go and do their own thing since they're grown but
 		they uh
 		they still talk about our camping trips so maybe they didn't dislike them so much
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure
 	
 	
 		but uh are you planning to go on any more camping trips
 	
 	
 		well i don't know
 	
 	
 		well if you get invited huh
 	
 	
 		if i get invited maybe yeah
 	
 	
 		all right
 		that sounds good
 	
 	
 		if i find time
 	
 	
 		yeah you stay pretty busy here then
 	
 	
 		that's the hard part
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		what's about your ideal time when you go camping how long do you have like to go
 	
 	
 		how long to go for
 	
 	
 		no how many how many how many a week a two weeks a few days or
 	
 	
 		um i i don't know we've only gone that one time and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was five
