 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay you ready
 	
 	
 		yeah is that it okay um well we i guess we have to talk about magazines and um what what
 	
 	
 		that's it
 		what what kind do you subscribe to or do you
 	
 	
 		well i subscribe to People well i did subscribe to People for a long time i do you know i enjoy People and now i'm um i uh subscribe to uh Ladies Ladies Home Journal
 	
 	
 		i uh take a computer magazine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh also
 		uh
 		Better Homes And Garden
 	
 	
 		okay are you interested in in computers
 	
 	
 		and my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside and the cardboard pages
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		uh-huh yeah well that that would be one of my peeves my pet peeves with magazines uh the woman's magazines especially i mean it it's really
 		geared to your all they have is you have too many recipes first of all i just don't you know that's what i don't like about um Ladies Home Journal magazines
 		too many recipes too many um can this marriage be saved nonsense i you know i like to read articles about things that matter well of course People magazine is not you know one of your uh
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		your more intellectual magazines but it's nice light reading  you know if i want something intellectual i usually read a book
 	
 	
 		well that's true i uh i like it when they have short stories like Redbook used to always have a good short story in it
 	
 	
 		well that's true yeah they did
 	
 	
 		and i i haven't bought a Redbook in a while so i guess i i really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well is Redbook still in existence i didn't know if they were if they were around anymore
 	
 	
 		well uh i think it is surely it's an institution surely it would have to be
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'll tell you the only reason i bought the uh i subscribe to the Journal is because of
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		which  i think it was either yeah it was Publisher's Clearinghouse  they they told me you know if i didn't subscribe they were gonna take me off their their winning you know their list  so
 	
 	
 		right
 		i know and it was serious  mine too i wasn't this was it my last chance
 	
 	
 		yeah my last right right my last chance to win ten million dollars so i figured hey look  for twelve dollars you know
 	
 	
 		well i i uh i went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that uh to uh Entertainment
 	
 	
 		that's it
 		oh yeah oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i was real disappointed with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i don't know it just
 		not enough
 		stories with some substance that you can really get into  it's just little  short articles more than anything  else
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's one thing i don't like about People uh it's just you know doesn't seem to have enough story to it
 	
 	
 		well i don't know i just think uh you know it's
 		it's light reading you know you don't have to excuse well you don't have to concentrate you know you know it's entertaining you know and uh
 	
 	
 		if you've only got a short time to read
 		no that's true
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's i just i enjoy it i you know i um
 		well that Entertainment is is very wasn't that similar to or isn't it similar to to the TV Guide
 	
 	
 		uh no not really
 		i mean uh not the one i take now it's a it's a magazine and it goes into all the movies previewing the movies
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that are going to be released or it's behind the scenes
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm a real movie buff so
 		that's why i thought i might be interested in it but it just hasn't been what i thought it would be
 	
 	
 		no
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh my mother has subscribed too the reason i get uh the
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		Home Journal and and the uh
 		computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		otherwise if if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the
 		grocery shelf i'll pick it up then
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		rather than to have them delivered and think oh i really need to read this
 	
 	
 		well well i'll tell you since i've been getting the Journal like maybe
 		maybe i'll read two maybe three if i read three articles in in you know one of the the Journals i figure you know i did really well
 	
 	
 		yeah it paid for itself
 	
 	
 		because there's just nothing in there that interests me i don't you know i don't i'm not into recipes you know recipes and  you know
 	
 	
 		well i i do like recipe and crafts
 	
 	
 		see now and i'm not into crafts so so you know that that eliminates like three quarters of the magazine  you know well
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		i just got the new issue they have Bette Midler on the cover so that should be one article that i'll read anyway
 	
 	
 		do you uh ever
