 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i guess i don't have as much time for hobbies as i used to
 	
 	
 		what is your hobby
 		isn't that the truth
 	
 	
 		uh i got two young boys
 		uh four and two so i spend a lot of time with them  but uh whenever the weather's nice and uh we can get out i like to work in the garden a little bit uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		get that mud up in your fingernails yeah yeah i know how it goes
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you know that's pretty relaxing to me like this
 	
 	
 		oh hey i tell you what getting outdoors is wonderful i do too my wife always gets mad at me for doing it so much because she says you know i always come in so hot and sweaty and tired i said yeah but i love it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but for my you know my hobby believe it or not is really a collection i i collect Mickey Mouse
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and i it is a full time hobby of going out there and finding things to to add to the collection i got well over two thousand Mickey Mouse items so that's that's my hobby
 	
 	
 		wow that's great
 	
 	
 		uh at one time and this is about fifteen years ago i actually uh got some uh what do you call it uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh plywood board and i made some Christmas cut out figures that i put in the yard and i mean they
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		everyone always talks about you know where'd i buy them and i keep telling them but i didn't buy them i i made them you know and they stood there now for some fifteen years so uh and that in itself was a lot of fun you know but i've never worked with a jig saw before but it sure did work you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow that's pretty neat
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i guess the other hobby that i did at one time i don't do anymore is good old needlepointing and uh that was my wife's hobby and
 	
 	
 		hm
 		i see
 	
 	
 		so i picked it up and i did some stuff and i entered it into the state fair and i won a couple ribbons and said well okay but  for some reason it just didn't really catch my thing but my hobby of collecting Mickey Mouse
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think i've got the disease now
 	
 	
 		now that you have more and more time on your hands right
 	
 	
 		true true but i don't know you know it's you you're right though uh with the kids and i now have a six year old i don't have as much time for the hobbies as i used to
 	
 	
 		what
 		yeah yeah i know what you mean they take up all my time now i'm kind of looking forward to the time when uh they're a little bit older and they can get out and you know get a little more active in sports and
 	
 	
 		well  at this point my kid is six years old the we just finished our first season of flag football and daddy had a ball now i don't know if he had a good time but i had a great time and
 	
 	
 		ah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i look you know more forward to that i guess maybe that stage of my life i i don't have enough time to do hobbies but i do have enough time to to play with the kids and that's what i wanna do
 	
 	
 		yeah me too i'm i'm really i can't wait for that time  i really can't wait
 	
 	
 		uh  i took them out to a a a little T-ball and that that that worked out real nice
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		he he enjoyed it uh i'm not sure that he understood what was going on but you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but at six years old i i think they're still a little bit young
 	
 	
 		yeah see my oldest is four
 	
 	
 		but the
 		but flag football he picked up that real quick he loved it
 	
 	
 		really that
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah and daddy loved it too i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's pretty good yeah mine's um uh just now has started getting into well you know like all the other little little young kids he was up on the Turtles and stuff but now he's trying to get into Robin Hood
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		and so we're gonna get him some one of those Nerf Robin Hood bow and arrow things
 	
 	
 		well  i'm going to be doing for this Christmas uh i'm buying him a uh swing set which includes a fort and everything else
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they say it only takes thirteen hours to build i'm thinking uh-huh so i have a feeling i might find myself with a full time hobby  i've got a uh a fence builder who's gonna come over there to help me so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		hopefully between the two of us we can figure out how to put that sucker together
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it always always helps to get somebody to help you out
 	
 	
 		got
 		oh yes the the swing set that we have a little Jim Dandy uh made out of metal is okay but he's much too big for that and his imagination's much bigger so we we've got the monkey bars and the fort and you know it goes on and on and on
 	
 	
 		hm uh-huh yeah
 		wow
 		yeah yeah whenever uh um every now and then i'll take mine to the park and they like to play on all of that stuff that's at the park and and it's like you said it's got the fort and you know it's the whole works
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		made out of wood
 	
 	
 		and and now who knows maybe the kids in the neighborhood will wanna come to his house to play you know  so
 	
 	
 		he always goes over their houses huh
 	
 	
 		uh right now we always do because he says there's nothing to play with at our house so well okay so  i'd like to have my turn to be able to invite the kids because i i don't know about you but i love having the kids around it's fun
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah uh there aren't too many right now actually mine are the oldest on our block uh the other ones are at least a year to two years younger so ours is a a block of pretty young kids right now
 	
 	
 		ah
 		uh i think in my neighborhood there's about two or three at the same age but most of them are about two or three years older so mine my  a little bit younger so but oh well he'll he'll he'll get there
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		i see
 		
 
 		yeah i wanna know this side of it and and they do they do tend to congregate around our house and and you know i never really thought about that much either all the little ones come over and they kind of hang around our front yard but uh
 	
 	
 		so so i guess the bottom line conclusion is take
