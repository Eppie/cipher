 
     		
 	
 		so so what have you seen lately that um you think is worthwhile
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um the last movie i saw was Regarding Regarding Henry have you seen that yet
 	
 	
 		no i i saw the previews
 	
 	
 		it's really good i loved it um it's um
 	
 	
 		does does he does it have a happy ending or
 	
 	
 		yeah really good ending um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um it was just it's one of the best movies i've seen in a long time i generally don't get into movies that much but i saw that one and then before that one i saw um
 		oh Naked Gun Two and a Half
 	
 	
 		oh that was funny wasn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah did you have you seen that one
 	
 	
 		yes and and and and the regular Naked Gun and Airport and you know
 	
 	
 		yeah it's exactly like Airplane One and  but it was silly
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right
 		so now these are fairly two very different movies one one  absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly you know serious subject
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i guess i have similarly broad tastes um my most recent um
 		movie that i that i liked a lot not my most recent movie was Henry the Fifth i only only rented it you know maybe a month ago and it's been out for a couple of years but have you seen that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i haven't seen that yet um-hum
 	
 	
 		well it's it's a it's an adaptation of the of the Shakespeare play uh and it is beautifully done um
 		i believe that all the language is is Shakespeare read it except it's been shortened a little bit and there might be a word or two changed
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but it's it's it's a glorious movie  um and i like as you know these these these  silly silly movies
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and i also like just some strange strange movies do you do you have any
 	
 	
 		such as
 	
 	
 		well the the one that comes immediately to mind i um is The Cook the Thief His Wife Her Lover
 		um  but there also these various um
 		but David Lynch movies um i got i got hooked on Twin Peaks that made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie i could lay my hands on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh really i haven't seen any of those
 	
 	
 		oh um well i don't i don't especially recommend i mean  you have you have to just sort of like this though you have to like did you see Twin Peaks
 	
 	
 		they're really good
 		huh-uh no
 	
 	
 		no so okay so if you weren't if you weren't drawn to watch that you maybe wouldn't be drawn to these movies either
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they're they're just strange yeah
 	
 	
 		are they i mean is it
 		like mystery or
 	
 	
 		oh well it
 	
 	
 		suspense or
 	
 	
 		i think suspense is the right word um and and but but little bit strange and esoteric and um
 		
 
 		in the case of Twin Peaks a little bit there's some elements of the supernatural in it too
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		that that was the television show
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um
 		there's also a a a producer of of movies in Baltimore called um
 		John Walters
 		who who puts puts out even weirder movies
 		he uh his most recent ones have actually been fairly fairly mainstream like Hairspray
 		um but back in his early days he he he had things um
 		um
 		what are what are the titles i can't remember the titles anymore but but some really weird ones uh with
 		quite a random crew of of characters um it would've made you know these Fellini movies look normal
 	
 	
 		right so do you like um movies a lot see i don't do i don't
 	
 	
 		i i do i do like movies a lot
 	
 	
 		really see i don't do that i don't go to movies that often but just recently i've been to a couple
 	
 	
 		do do you rent them or
 	
 	
 		um no we i just go to like the dollar movie theater around here generally but i don't know i just i usually fall asleep or  i get bored pretty easily so
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah that's what my wife does too um i mean she falls asleep  so we have to we have to pick just the right kind of movie to to to to to appeal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		right
 		that's exactly how
 	
 	
 		well well it was good talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah it's good to talk to you too
 	
 	
 		take care uh-huh okay bye
 	
 	
 		uh-huh bye-bye
