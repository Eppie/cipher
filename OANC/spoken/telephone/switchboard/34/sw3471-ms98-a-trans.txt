 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay you don't have any children
 	
 	
 		no we were never blessed with children um we had a foster child for a while and we're real active
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in church with some of the young people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i hear i heard one of yours
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes we have four  and they range in ages from eight until the youngest is eight months so
 	
 	
 		so you have a considerable range of of interests and activities and so forth
 	
 	
 		right we do and when they were speaking about some of the activities that you like to participate in as a family one of our very favorite is reading we love to read read with our children and to them and
 		and so far they've been they've grown up with a love for reading too and we're very glad about that
 	
 	
 		that's terrific you know that's not i've i've observed that that's not done enough these year these days
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		when we had our foster son he was um
 		uh two and a half to three and a half that that year in there and we read every night because we just felt like that was important to spend time
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		with him there's so little time one-on-one time these days with mechanical or or the electronic uh games and and TV and so forth to draw folks away
 	
 	
 		boy i'll say
 		right
 		boy i'll say that's right my with our well where with all of them we start right from the time they were born and and spent time reading with them and
 		and they seem they enjoy it the kids will get the books and bring to us and say you know let's read a book
 	
 	
 		did they have them memorized and and know if you're skipping a page
 	
 	
 		uh yeah they do they do did you experience that too
 	
 	
 		yes it it on nights when it was already really late and i'd try to short circuit it it was no no no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh  and they catch on pretty quick  you mentioned TV watching
 		watching too much TV and i i feel that's a real big problem also i i think that there's just too much of that it's used too much as a babysitter and
 		and
 	
 	
 		i totally agree
 	
 	
 		people just plop the kids down in front of it and
 	
 	
 		now there are some wonderful programs for children and when i had our foster son i was babysitting i had
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		four under the age of three and we ended up using television couple times a day when Sesame Street was on
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to entertain them but also to do some learning things and then we re-enforced that then with with some of the things that we were involved in if i was in the kitchen and and so forth the little girl wanted to emulate everything i did
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so and we talked about the letters and numbers and so fourth so we used it as a tool
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but not
 		i won't say i was perfect it wasn't ever used as a babysitter while i was busy with one of the others but
 	
 	
 		oh that's right
 		that's right and then i can't say say that either but then like you say there's some good shows on it and there's some good videos also that you can rent that are
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know real helpful and  um we also like to play with our kids i one of one of our other favorite things to do is to have
 		pillow fights with them  and they really enjoy that they laugh and you know it's winter here and it's hard to get outside and do a lot of
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		lot of outdoor physical type things and so
 	
 	
 		i hadn't thought about that
 	
 	
 		yeah so we we do pillow fights and um course just play with them play games and
 		um when you were growing up did you spend time did your family camp or or what other activities
 	
 	
 		we did we went camping and then Richard and i did that all through our our twenty years together too so it was something that carried over from both our backgrounds and into into our current life
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		your your pillow fights reminded me though that when when i was growing up um uh we we spent four years in Utah and then we went from there to Germany and and it was even further north
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		boy i'll bet
 	
 	
 		and uh daddy used to roughhouse in the winter time with us we'd get on the floor and just you know play play play tickle games and and and hug and cuddle and that was important to do that bonding and i never thought of that till you mentioned the pillow fights
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh it is oh
 	
 	
 		but we'd get everybody involved in that well it was just my brother and i and we thoroughly enjoyed that that time spent with daddy that we didn't get to see him very much at all
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		boy i'll say i'll say you do and and i think like you say the bonding and the physical you know loving and touching that's that's very important i feel like so um
 	
 	
 		do you have outside the home activities that that you do with the the family
 	
 	
 		yes we do we well like i say we the little community we live in it's winter a lot of time  so we go sleigh riding and the kids love that they love there's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		several hills close by that we that are kind of designated sleigh riding hills and and we take the tubes you know the tubes and toboggans and
 		and go and do that in the winter and in the summer um oh bike riding and
 		we go well we've we've each got a bike with the little one we haven't done it this last summer as much because she's just so so tiny that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we didn't get a chance but um we've got the swings and had a trampoline
