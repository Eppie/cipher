 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so i guess you're a Cowboy fan
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i guess we're sort of we're stuck with that down here Brad we have to be  but uh been it's been difficult suffering with them through the past few years but it looks like they could be
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		you know on their way back a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah what's what's the story with uh your quarterback though
 	
 	
 		our quarterback's hurt right now he's gonna be out for a couple more weeks at the very least and may miss the rest of the season
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		course if they're lucky enough to make the play-offs he may be ready for then
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		we're we're fortunate to have a
 		you know a a fairly good back up quarterback that's come in
 		but i tell you what the people of Dallas uh
 		they love their Cowboys i'm a i've been here since seventy four and uh they're quite easy to easily to get attached to
 		and uh we've got our new coach now Jimmy Johnson which i we like we like what he's doing
 		they've forgotten about Tom Landry  he's a great coach in his day but they've forgotten about him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so who
 	
 	
 		yeah isn't the Cowboys were the tradition you know
 	
 	
 		oh yes who who's your favorite team
 	
 	
 		uh well it's kind of weird for me i'll tell you why first of all i used to be a Jet fan when i grew up
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i grew up on Long Island where the Jets play uh i mean they're in New York City but it's closer to Long Island
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh then the Giants which were up in the Bronx uh but then around eighty five the Giants started playing really good defense and they started you know really not that i'm a fair weather fan
 		but they really started looking good you know so now i root for both teams Jets and the Giants
 		but i'm involved in this uh rotisserie league i don't know if you're familiar with those
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		well you draft players from different teams
 		so it's kind of you get points based on how many how many touch downs and and and and stuff like that that players on all different teams uh make
 	
 	
 		well i'll be darned
 	
 	
 		so you get kind of caught up um  and now i got like you know players  players on on like Buffalo and and Washington and and i i happened to have uh your kicker
 	
 	
 		why sure
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh Micheal Irvin who was a great he's a great wide receiver and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		so how how's your team doing
 	
 	
 		so my team's doing pretty good for for those guys i have i do have a couple of Giants um but they're not doing that much and uh i also have
 	
 	
 		well good
 		the Giants are having a sad year
 	
 	
 		one Jet yeah they're not they're not looking too good um but you know it's always tough after you win a Super Bowl i guess and
 	
 	
 		i know maybe we're maybe we're both teams of the future huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and they they um they um i mean last year was just fantastic with the Giants winning the Super Bowl it was just
 	
 	
 		oh we're well it was fantastic they had a hell of a season
 	
 	
 		yeah and it was such a i don't know maybe because i'm a Giants fan but but uh it was such a unbelievable run you know all the games were like won by field goals and stuff like that so it was
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 		they had a great coach i think they're they're missing their coach but
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		most of all they're just they're in a rebuilding type of thing they've got they're quarterback's down too right now so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the big thing  oops
 	
 	
 		i'm here
 		hello
 	
 	
 		big big Phil's trying to come back hold just a second that's that's my other line
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		sorry Brad okay
 	
 	
 		that's all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so anyway Phil's trying to bring them back right now i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah they got a big game this weekend i think if they win it they got a shot at getting into the play-offs but i don't think they're gonna win
 	
 	
 		who they play this weekend
 	
 	
 		they're playing the Eagles
 	
 	
 		oh it's a big game yeah they play at up in Philadelphia
 	
 	
 		uh no they play in New York
 	
 	
 		play in New York well yeah
 		good chance there hope so
 	
 	
 		but i i don't know  first of all they don't they haven't done too well against the Eagles lately
 	
 	
 		i think we
 		right and we just hope we just hope Dallas makes it and of course all that depends on what Philadelphia and New York does too so i don't know
 	
 	
 		and
 		
 
 		yeah i guess you got to pipe it off having the Giants uh win this weekend to knock out Philadelphia
 	
 	
 		that's true because both our teams are like eight and five you guys are up what seven and six i guess
 	
 	
 		you know
 		um-hum but uh yeah i think i think i think Dallas will make it i think that i think they're they're uh they're doing pretty well and i think that like if the season ended now they'd be in the play-offs so you just have to like win two out of the next three or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i hope so their first play-off games travel to Detroit i believe and that's that'll be a tough one on
 	
 	
 		really oh you never know i mean what's to you know Detroit's only one game up maybe they'll oh well they lost to Detroit already though didn't they this year yes so they can
 	
 	
 		right yeah it was there but they lost them playing there but uh still a tough game
 	
 	
 		well maybe they'll get lucky and not have to go to Detroit because that's a tough place to play lately
 	
 	
 		they
 		but you got Emmett Smith versus Barry Sanders it ought to be a little exciting be a good game anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess their quarterback on uh Detroit was hurt too they're all getting knocked down so maybe they have a better shot against this new quarterback because they haven't Detroit hasn't played as well with this guy as with
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		um i don't know i think i think his name's Kramer
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh they used to have uh Rodney Pete who was doing really well for them and then he got hurt so
 	
 	
 		yeah he was doing well and the kid from Houston they drafted from Houston uh they gave all that money to
 	
 	
 		right yeah he's doing a lot
 	
 	
 		they've got a lot of high dollar players i tell you
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh
 	
 	
 		what do you this is off the subject a little bit but what do you feel about the amount of money
 		these guys that are are making and uh the amount of time
