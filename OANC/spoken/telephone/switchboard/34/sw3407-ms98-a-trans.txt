 		Bob
 	
 	
 		Bob okay
 		uh how how do you feel about uh gun control Bob
 	
 	
 		it's it's kind of like abortion it's kind of a touchy subject but um i i feel that
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		any person is uh has the right to be armed but i don't think they should have an arsenal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't believe in uh automatic weapons i don't believe in in uh having antitank guns and
 		um i i
 		there's just there's just too many uh weapons around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh i kind of i agree i guess i don't i don't think that we need uh
 		um these these automatic or semiautomatic rifles even i mean i don't really even care that the i don't know if you hunt or not but i don't even care that some of the hunters say they they like them i mean
 	
 	
 		no i'm i'm not
 	
 	
 		that you know uh maybe they use them for legitimate purposes but they're all you know folks are getting them and using them for not so legitimate to say the least
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no
 	
 	
 		purposes what do you feel about uh um how do you feel about a waiting period
 	
 	
 		i yeah i think that's a a good thing in
 		in the sense that it um it stops someone that is acting on a impulse however
 		uh anyone that has a revenge factor in mind is is going to weight that out
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um most um Dallas has if you read in the papers recently um the um
 		uh murder ratio in Dallas one point uh seven i think per day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and ninety somewhat percent of these know
 		uh the perpetrator it's it's not it's not criminals that are going out and killing people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it it's people with guns that are that are shooting other people
 	
 	
 		yeah it's probably not someone that's running down to the store and buying one either is it probably someone who's got one already yeah
 	
 	
 		no someone that's got one and and and for some reason whatever um they became
 		uh enraged or
 		you know it uh
 		some of these are somebody's dating somebody's uh girl friend or ex-wife or
 		um
 		a person that they know and and
 		it's it's again something that you know it's it's a uh
 		it's a decision of uh emotion
 		not um
 		it's not something you can really control usually i don't think you can
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't think you can regulate it
 		if they don't use a gun maybe they'll use a knife
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 		yeah i mean yeah i don't know if i mean yeah if someone wants to do someone in they're gonna do it whether they have a gun or not uh what do you think about that um that uh
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		deal with the police officer evidently evidently um i guess they speculate that it was teenagers
 		that that somehow got a hold of a gun
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah
 		yeah and and you look at the you know drive by shootings and things like that with with young uh people involved it's it's
 		it's a very volatile situation it's a funny world that we live in
 	
 	
 		yeah i i we just moved here about eight or nine months ago from from uh a little town in North Carolina
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh we have lived in Fort Worth before and and in Houston for a while so we we're you know we're accustomed to the big city but my kids weren't in in the age they are now they're in uh high school and junior middle school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the middle the high schools around here um man police have come in and and uh you know they got they raid the school and take out ten revolvers you know i mean it's just uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so it seems like
 		um you know it seems like and no and that's not a case of someone flipping out and running down and buying one so a waiting period isn't gonna help that but it seems like that there ought to be something that could be done  to
 		at least make it harder for those kids to get their hands on guns
 	
 	
 		well that that's parental control
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and that's you know that extends beyond guns that extends to drugs and everything else that that is bad in our society and and we don't have the
 		we don't have the parental control that that we need
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		that's that's a there's there's there's no deterrent um there really isn't and and you're not going to stop uh guns from being on the streets
 		again if they don't use a gun they'll use something else
 		and and then you take away the fact that uh
 		somebody has a right to protect their property
