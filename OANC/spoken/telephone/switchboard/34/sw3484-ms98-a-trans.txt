 
     		
 	
 		you feel about uh drug testing in the work place
 	
 	
 		well actually i'm all for it even though um  for instance like in the area that i work for you know there's no danger you know of someone getting hurt because of you know being on drugs or something but uh
 		uh  i think because of ethics involved and uh things i'm just i'm in favor of it i i realize that that's putting
 		a lot of  government control in effect or or control over people
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i think we need something in place to uh to solve the problems i certainly uh feel that it ought to be done
 		in public safety situations you know airline pilots and flight controllers and people who run trains and buses and taxi cabs
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 		well it's just like uh i can't remember now where it was what two three months ago there was that there was that bad train wreck and uh one of the um
 		engineers running the train was on drugs you know and people were killed in it and and yeah when it comes to safety and people being killed i definitely think it should be a requirement you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you're uh you know to heck with their rights you know they're interfering with people's rights to live
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if they're in that type of position and have that much control over people
 	
 	
 		one of the issues that came up for me personally was that uh
 		we see  i've gotten involved in uh foster care
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i've seen a lot of uh kids come into foster care as a result of their parents being on drugs
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh there's probably a lot out there that could probably stand public assistance or being rescued uh which aren't identified and so uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		testing at the work place in uh in in general i think is probably a good idea to to save some of the kids
 	
 	
 		feeling like that if you know then you can look into a situation and in case there are children involved
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i can i can understand that i i think it is
 		you know i think it's so sad these these crack babies that are now coming into you know grade school elementary school you know that are so um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh you know they're so messed up themselves and you know in talking to teachers i have several uh friends that are teachers  they uh
 		um you know they're hard to control they're hard to deal with and yeah i think that would be a good idea
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		being i'm a contract person with Texas Instruments and before i could even go to work here i had to be drug tested you know and they do a random drug testing of their employees
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but so far
 		far um
 		they don't require everyone to do it they just go through randomly and pick someone and you know and go do it and TI has an excellent um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		assistance program if you're found you know found with drugs they actually give you i think um three tries
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know to to quit it or get off of it or or whatever before you're you know dismissed i mean they work with you and they they have a program uh
 		uh that you can go to that the company picks up the tab for and also it's really an excellent program i know it seems like the older ones here are in favor of it the younger ones you know course are still
 		they're either you know doing some marijuana  or something or they're very idealistic you know and uh i don't know i think sometimes the older that you get i think the more ramifications you can see of so many things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well our company uh testing when you're hired is a requirement
 	
 	
 		is it
 	
 	
 		and i think they have a policy of uh random testing but uh i don't know whether they've ever done it or not i kind of wish they would
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um and we do have an employee assistance program that's uh good for uh drug abuse uh treatments and other psychological uh problems
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		stress in the work place marital problems whatever's  bothering you
 	
 	
 		yeah this this program you know encompasses everything but you know i thought you know it's not an instant dismissal if you are found to be taking drugs which i think you know is good and it's good on TI TI's part as i said i think they give you three chances
 		you know to come to grips with it before you're dismissed
 	
 	
 		what
 		you know a lot of times i see problems here at work though uh i remember a few years back i had a uh schematic drawing that needed to be done and i was in a hurry to get it out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i sent these drawing the rough draft over to drafting and i usually do a pretty decent drawing myself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when the drawing came back uh it was was apparent that it had been done by two people because the line work
