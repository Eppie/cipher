 
     		
 	
 		all right i guess tonight's subject is to discuss current events and how we keep up on current events and if we're
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		satisfied with with the uh coverage that we receive
 	
 	
 		that's
 		right
 	
 	
 		um thinking about it some of the ways i try and keep up on current events is uh
 		i enjoy reading the newspaper but uh quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper and so uh i enjoy watching some of the TV highlights and also
 		um some of the news periodicals uh weekly magazines and uh at work i also have
 		uh management summary reports that uh give basically a lot of the current events
 		uh how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well unlike you i don't i don't i like to read the paper but i basically don't do it every day
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i um i usually watch uh either Good Morning America or the Today Show every morning while i'm you know whatever i'm doing and i watch that i usually watch the news either at
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know early evening or at ten o'clock so i get it from TV a lot i get Time magazine i read Time magazine um that's one i read pretty regularly and uh
 	
 	
 		right right
 		oh yes okay you think that that's uh pretty adequate coverage and you get
 	
 	
 		the thing about it you know now that i've found found is that we get such good coverage on TV or at least such i don't know attempted thoroughness of coverage by the time you get the Time Magazine Magazine there's nothing in it you don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it's historic events huh
 	
 	
 		yeah if if you know then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something because really i thought lately there's nothing new in the Time Magazine
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		you know it's it's basically you've heard everything
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh you might you might get a little more thorough uh account of something but really um i don't know i so i get most of mine from television
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i would say
 	
 	
 		um i found out too that uh quite often if i see something on television that i want more in depth uh understanding or or get want to know more about it that the
 		the newspaper or uh i read Newsweek can give you a better
 		and more a thorough coverage of what i've heard on TV but uh
 		um i found out that also on on TV that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on CNN and and like you said the the news shows that are that are happening and you can read some more about it if you want to
 		um i found out though that or i feel that
 		a lot of the stuff on TV and the newspapers is negative there's an awful lot of  negative
 		news or bad news or or bad news and uh it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear to hear some good news
 	
 	
 		right and i i think there's an attempt to do that uh you know i think people there's a mild attempt for that but i think basically we basically associate news with bad news
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		
 
 		yes we do
 	
 	
 		or or or catastrophes or problems or crises or uh you know i think our concept of news isn't isn't necessarily events that happen it's more negative like you said
 	
 	
 		true true
 	
 	
 		but i i think people try to on the on TV i think they try to throw in good stuff but it doesn't uh it doesn't sway the vote
 	
 	
 		um-hum i've heard an interesting interesting comment also that
 		uh with budget cuts and uh expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a
 		in-depth analysis or uh investigative reporting on certain topics and issues but that takes time that takes a lawful lot of money and commitment and
 		and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or
 		what they call ambulance chasing and go after it you know it's quite easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things so i don't know i guess the economy is is effecting also the news media
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we have to pay that price but um
 		i don't know i don't know it's it's interesting and i think that now a days with communications the way they are also that we can see global events happening as
 		as they occur all over the world like the
 	
 	
 		right  you know the war last winter was certainly a good example of that because we saw every single thing practically
 	
 	
 		exactly we saw
 		yes it you know twenty years ago thirty years ago we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or or luxury to to view that
 	
 	
 		i mean you know i remember well just the things that are covered i remember watching the World Series during the earthquake and just seeing that happen i mean you know that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the and the announcers you know grabbing i mean it's like that was just something because that was like live and real
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like you said and then of course one thing i think too is with television
