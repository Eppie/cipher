 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		push my number okay
 	
 	
 		okay so are you a a a golfer or are you a spectator
 	
 	
 		oh i'm a i play golf but i don't actually play golf
 	
 	
 		well i'm the same way i i go out there and hit the ball
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hack it all over the place it's sickening isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 		uh well in the Carolina's it's it's just you know we've got a bunch of golf courses around here
 	
 	
 		yeah we've got tons up here but i don't know how do you feel about your game i guess that's a good question
 	
 	
 		uh well i mean i'm not a serious golfer at all uh uh a friend of mine goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and i uh i don't have a i don't really even have a game
 		i usually when i go out and play golf it's usually like at a at one of these par threes that you know you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 		i like watching it on TV
 	
 	
 		yeah i like that too
 		i don't know i try to play but God i a couple years ago i played two three times a week and got lousy i guess that's the best i ever got was lousy
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and i thought i was really improving and the big break was going to come and then i got worse again so
 	
 	
 		well i i i if i can i can hit a great deal like um
 		uh they they my friends to get me they they say i hit worm burners because i i can't hit it up in the air so i'm pretty bad but i i i get great distance hitting it you know uh for it going across the ground
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because i'm but i'm getting better i've got where now i can hit it in in the air some of the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah uh so i'm kind of a novice at it
 	
 	
 		um
 		i'm that at worse i i play next year i actually i take it kind of seriously but i've been doing so bad next year i always say this every year but next year i'm starting over from scratch
 		i'm going to go take lessons and everything i'm going to do it right and see if i can actually play this game or not
 	
 	
 		well that i i guess that's what i need to do is is get some kind of lessons or something because i my my tee off is not bad i mean i'm i'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it's just that that initial tee
 	
 	
 		yeah what do you do when you're putting that's a good thing that's something i could learn actually that's when i do my worst i finally get to the green and i think i'm doing all all fine and then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really you know checking the ground and and so forth you know see how it's going to break or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		can you really see it though what about the speed
 	
 	
 		yeah if you get if you get down on the ground you really can
 	
 	
 		can you tell how nah but can you tell how how fast you're going to hit it
 	
 	
 		um well if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it
 		not kill it but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's it's you know because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction
 	
 	
 		yeah but you can feel that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i have i can get get it within like you know four or five feet or something but
 		i don't have enough field now i'm TV watching they make you die at the hole every time oh it just dies and rolls in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's hard for me
 	
 	
 		but i
 		the the it's it's like i said once i get up on the green i'm fine but that that tee shot uh it you know when teeing off uh it
 		i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground so it it takes me awhile to get to the hole but
 	
 	
 		once you're there you're all set though
 	
 	
 		i'm all set
 	
 	
 		we should play team golf then i'll get us there and you put it in
 	
 	
 		that sounds good to me that it's uh
 	
 	
 		i see oh the TV golfers they do that it takes them two to get there and two to get it in so it's fifty percent and me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in
 	
 	
 		well it it it usually takes me about
 		probably two to to or three to get it there and and then that's according to the hole and it just uh uh maybe one or two putts it's according to where i'm at on the green
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		but the friends i play with uh they play all the time and and they're really good
 	
 	
 		Joe Pros
 	
 	
 		uh they're not Joe Pros but they they golf in the
 		high sixties low seventies so i guess they're pretty good
 	
 	
 		that's pretty good for eighteen
 	
 	
 		yeah for eighteen
 	
 	
 		wow that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm talking to the wrong guy your shitty golf is probably the best golf i've ever seen
 	
 	
 		no no no that's not my golf that's my friends mine mine i'm i'm usually in the eighties or nineties so i'm i'm not good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		if when i'm in the nineties i'm feeling good i'm usually around a hundred that's my thing around a hundred
 		you know i can hit a great drives and think i'm going to do all awesome on this hole but it ain't going to happen
 	
 	
 		well i either teeing off i either slice it or i hook it ever single time and and i alternate
 	
 	
 		well it's a good thing with me i slice it every single time
 		that's good i aim
