 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay would you like to um begin or would you like me to start
 	
 	
 		uh oh i can start i i think one of the the biggest uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into uh management
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and you're seeing them uh get uh elected to uh political offices uh not near enough i know there's still a long way to go especially in top management
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 		yes i agree
 	
 	
 		you're not seeing uh you know looking at TI you see them in management but you're not seeing them up there as VPs and i have a sister that's an attorney in Oklahoma City and i know the company that she was with
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh the women didn't have have near the positions the levels that the men attorneys had and were not uh given the same respect
 	
 	
 		right
 		i agree with that i i think you do see
 		more and more women out there in politics too as mayors or um you know in in helping to maybe um get some legislation passed to to have women have more rights i think still
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		even with that whole um  thing with Judge Thomas and and um you you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man or something the way they had it
 		the trial and um  i just think that it's it's still gonna take another generation or so before  before the women
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		really could really feel that they're really equal in the business world or that they work just as hard or harder  um
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but it's still um
 		going from hm from homemakers into um corporate leaders is still a big step
 	
 	
 		right i also think that uh uh women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be it used to be people would say do you work and
 		you'd say no i work in the home and it was it was then it was almost like a put down particularly particularly even by women in the work force
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i think now i think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very very important and it's getting the respect and which is about time
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 		i think it's true i think also people are having children at a older age so maybe like um you know you go through college and then you maybe work for a few years and then you have your first child
 	
 	
 		yes very definitely
 	
 	
 		and um you know you you know both sides of the coin
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly and to take care of
 		the kids and  and then uh maybe people that are just working and think oh you just stay at home but then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid it's like
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they lose it  they say wow this is harder than i thought well hm  you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		yes and and and to those that have never worked worked and had you know and have stayed home with the kids
 		kind of does your heart good  because i know i stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school and uh
 	
 	
 		i know it  i know
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you know it it kind of does me good i think also one of the things that that's really tremendous and it doesn't necessarily have to do with women but the fact that the fathers are so involved with families which again i think helps the woman's role
 	
 	
 		are so involved yes
 		right right their role has to change to kind of accommodate us too i know i have three children and my oldest is eleven and i've pretty much been home um since Brian was born
 	
 	
 		you know i
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um just recently i went back to work um last school semester to tutor um high school age students with learning disabilities and i was just out of the house two days a week
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i thought wow this is really hard only and it was only two days and i was home before three but getting the baby to day care getting the kids off to school i still did everything i always do
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know my husband still got up and went to work but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it it only those two it made a big difference i thought wow a full time i don't think i could swing that
 	
 	
 		well i had to course i work full time but my daughter and her husband were out of town
 	
 	
 		personally
 	
 	
 		so i had my grandchildren for four days during uh football soccer season
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and so i would work and her friends some friends would take care of the kids but i would have to get them picked up from there get them fed get them to practices get homework done get baths i was absolutely exhausted and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		picked up
 		dinner
 		right
 		i bet i bet
 	
 	
 		and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties or early forties to have their first children children i think are absolutely crazy
 	
 	
 		well i i know a lot of people i know i had my first child when i was twenty five and  that's not considered really young these days that's almost you know but um i have friends that that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		have kids just starting kindergarten and they're they're forty years old and and then like maybe a two year old at home and i think
 		boy i i'm i'm in my thirties
