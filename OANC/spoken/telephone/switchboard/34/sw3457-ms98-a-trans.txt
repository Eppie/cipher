 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh  let me see i've got two children one is uh both preschoolers one is two and one is um four
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so and um  this is my first year off and i've always worked uh the time that they were little and so i decided to
 		hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and  spend some more time with them which i hadn't been doing
 	
 	
 		well i think that's wonderful my children are in college
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i teach school and i teach uh middle school age children
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and so i see a lot of uh variation in what happens when kids are at home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have taught school ever since my children were little but the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's and your holidays are too so teaching i think is a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah  well that's what i was doing before i was teaching for a Richardson School District and um it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little and it was really hard
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right well with them being as young it was much much harder when mine were young
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his uh college work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and his Master's degree and so forth and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a full-time job
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right that's right and that's what was kind of what what where we were when you know we  i really didn't have to work but i felt like i really wanted to work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i felt i awful i felt like boy i was sure was missing a lot and they were growing so fast and
 		you know it's like do i really need to work you know  and i and it that choice was there i really didn't have to and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know  so i did have that advantage there but  it's different staying at home too you know it's an adjustment to make also
 	
 	
 		yes it certainly is we
 		well i think that um
 		we need to spend more family time together with with children today uh we made a point to spend a lot of quality time and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		involved in you know like uh through scouting or you know anything like that we participated and uh we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow that's great
 	
 	
 		when yeah  when uh
 		the kids were in high school it was harder to always have supper together but we did always have breakfast together
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we we had supper together as much as possible but when it wasn't
 		feasible you know we kind of kept a master calendar
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and when it wasn't feasible well that was understandable but uh we've always tried to spend time to talk and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have some time together time and we sat around the table we didn't sit in front of a TV or
 	
 	
 		ah that's great because that's
 	
 	
 		that kind of thing so i think that's been important because we do have a close family and even though the kids are basically uh grown uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and uh  have spoken before of they want that kind of situation
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know situation for them when you know and their children when they marry and have children
 	
 	
 		yeah kind of grows on and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they do what they see and you know
 	
 	
 		that's right they model and the with the dysfunctional families today i'm sure you with a as a schoolteacher also you see what happens to these kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the between uh oh second families or uh
 		one parent families or all those kinds of problems that they have and then you see them magnified magnified in the children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		yeah yeah plus you teach middle school so i'm sure that
 	
 	
 		oh boy yes
 	
 	
 		you are really you really boy oh boy i taught early childhood so i had the little ones
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and um you know i saw it there too and you you know you just
 		oh it's it kind of an eye-opener you know so
 	
 	
 		it is
 		it is and most i think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children and i think we make a point to do that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i think you're right
 	
 	
 		because we see we see all the time the outcome of not doing that and i think if we weren't so interested in in children in childfaring we wouldn't be teaching anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so uh i wish we could reach more of the rest of the world
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		because i think uh the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools it's what's happening in the families and uh they expect us to
 	
 	
 		i agree yeah
 	
 	
 		you know have create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers and you get to a point where it's completely impossible
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		yeah i agree i i know exactly what you're saying
 	
 	
 		and you just get more and more frustrated and yet you feel for the the kids you do the best you can but
