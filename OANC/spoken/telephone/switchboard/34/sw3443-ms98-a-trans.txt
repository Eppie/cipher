 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		surprised to get anybody this time of day but i've been i've been trying all different times and i don't get anybody at five thirty i don't get anybody at nine at night so i thought i'll try a really weird
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh well i'm at work and i just happened to walk back into my office i've been gone for a little while
 	
 	
 		oh  well well i go to school so i'm home certain days and um i really haven't been making many of these phone calls have you got
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i don't make i haven't ever made any i just receive them
 	
 	
 		have you have you received many
 	
 	
 		here i haven't here lately yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it it's uh well the first time we were on this it came just about every day i never had to make one they just always came
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		people must be tired of it or something well well anyway i guess we're supposed to discuss this uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		subject what do you think
 	
 	
 		well i never gave it any thought myself i was hoping you could tell me what you thought
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well i don't have any objection to people doing that i think it might be good for them but as a mother of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		two daughters i might be afraid of where they were sent is i'm just concerned about their safety more than because if they do good works in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if they were sent to a third world country i couldn't help but worry worried you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but that would be my main objection
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i don't know i think maybe it's it should stay on a voluntary basis
 	
 	
 		i don't think it'll probably never happen but
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah i i i think it would be good for uh everyone to do something like that but i i guess i don't feel like it should be something forced upon you
 	
 	
 		yeah well it it probably won't i don't i don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway we can't uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		seem to pay for all the things we have going now  that's another consideration
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know some some kids are so spoiled nowadays it might be a real eye opener you know
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i mean sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes and then they think
 		they're just kind of shocked at that side of town you know i probably lived in one of those when my i was a little girl
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um-hum
 		i have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while  wouldn't it though
 	
 	
 		oh boy that'd be an eye opener wouldn't it i mean right next to us is such a pitiful country
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it is
 	
 	
 		i know sometimes i wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world and helping some countries i never even heard of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum i know it
 	
 	
 		seems to me we uh it be to our benefit to strengthen that country
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		right on our borders
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but what do i know right  i'm just sitting at home and and uh doing laundry today and certainly not up nobody has called me from Washington  oh but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh shoot
 	
 	
 		anyway how did you get on this program
 	
 	
 		i work at TI
 	
 	
 		oh you do work at TI oh you're in Lewisville oh yeah i just went by that place we were going to a football play-off game a week or so ago which we lost and  we went by that's the first time i'd seen it looked really nice a lot of trees there it looked like a pretty little uh site
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah
 		hang on a minute
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		hm do you need a bag no i don't think so yeah Patty might okay
 		i'm back
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		but how'd you get on it
 	
 	
 		did
 		well my husband works at TI over on uh Central uh why we're living in Arlington i'm not so sure but he works over there and that's we did it last time
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so  just my daughter and i are registered this time i don't know they didn't even ask him back  that was weird wasn't it
 	
 	
 		really
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but like i said i hardly ever get any calls this time and i can never find anybody
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i don't get too many hm
 	
 	
 		i so um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the first time i used to get calls from far away too
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		like Maryland and New Jersey and but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that i get calls from
 	
 	
 		yeah i've had the same experiences all right around here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know uh i wonder if they really i don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize the all different accents there's just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there's so many within this one town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know even even in some families some people talk a little bit different
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		my husband's from New Jersey and one of his sisters says things that really sound funny to me and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way and that's one family right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		course i think everyb ody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny but you you know how that goes  oh God
 	
 	
 		oh i agree  oh shoot
 	
 	
 		well i'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet sometimes she says at night
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh our switch are are overloads so please end your conversation
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right
 		well well do you have anymore words of wisdom about the subject  you don't have any kids you wanna send over there
 	
 	
 		no i sure don't
 		no no kids  oh shoot
 	
 	
 		well it is  well uh i don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto well one of them is real idealistic she might
 	
 	
 		my sister is i'd be more suited to that than her she's just bugs
