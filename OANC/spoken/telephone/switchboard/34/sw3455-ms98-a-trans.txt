 
     		
 	
 		okay uh i guess our topic is about movies
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh what a coincidence we got a baby sitter and we went to the movies this past weekend
 	
 	
 		oh so did i
 	
 	
 		and we saw Cape Fear
 	
 	
 		oh i heard that was excellent is it um i wanted to see that i was deciding between that and uh My Girl and my boyfriend and i went to see My Girl
 	
 	
 		it is it's really good
 		oh how's that
 	
 	
 		oh it was excellent it was a really really good movie i'd recommend it
 	
 	
 		i i heard that's a a movie that uh you really can't take children is that true
 	
 	
 		um i heard the opposite that um you should take children to see it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um there were quite um few uh kids in there with their parents
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah um i don't know though i i've heard that and then what you just told me so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah because uh the little boy dies
 	
 	
 		right yeah it was sad it was really sad but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		his it kind of shows how his um best friend this little girl deals with his death and how i think maybe how children should deal with death maybe
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it was really good it was sad very sad
 	
 	
 		oh i wanna see that one well Cape Fear was was more suspenseful it was really suspenseful so that that's that's a real good movie to see
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		i heard it was um
 		sort of like um
 		not um too violent but it was kind of like um
 		gross kind of like um Silence of the Lambs like
 	
 	
 		uh no and no it uh it's kind of i don't know it's kind of both i guess but it's not it's not as bad as Silence of the Lambs
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but uh it's just as suspenseful i think and it it was a real good movie
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then we saw
 		Beauty and the Beast  because we have two kids and Fievel Goes West
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh
 		oh i've seen um
 		previews for them on TV but i
 	
 	
 		but uh those were those were okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so and then oh boy it's been it's been so long since we've been to the movies but i we've rented some videos
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i like to rent movies too
 	
 	
 		and i think the last one i rented was uh Mortal Thoughts with Demi Moore
 	
 	
 		oh i
 		oh i i didn't see that
 	
 	
 		and um that that that's okay that's pretty good oh and um What About Bob
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've seen that at the theatres yeah that that was cute
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we rented that one
 		and uh uh i guess that's probably about it have you rented any movies lately
 	
 	
 		um
 		the last movie i rented was The Hard Way with Michael J Fox and um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that was good we rented that one too

 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's been movies out that i've been wanting to see i just you know don't get a chance to get out and see them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well we have two little kids so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies we have to dig up a baby sitter and
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and that's only the only time we can go out so
 		our time is scarce
 	
 	
 		yeah oh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		but um
 		we we we try we you know we're we're big movie people and and we try and do and i don't i don't know about the last movie i've seen on TV that was real good um
