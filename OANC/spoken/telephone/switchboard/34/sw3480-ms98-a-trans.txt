 		there Portuguese and Italian blood in me and i kind of miss the cheeses  because in in Dallas only get a bunch of domestic stuff you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh i love Italian food though it's probably my favorite kind of food
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is Italian food i don't think i've ever had Portuguese food
 	
 	
 		well it's mostly they eat a lot of stews and soups and stuff
 	
 	
 		what is that it's
 	
 	
 		a lot of the stew and soup they they boil you know they boil or broil a lot of their food
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and it it's kind of like Spanish except it's not quite as spicy as the Spanish food
 	
 	
 		oh yeah hm
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like Mexican food
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah the Mexicans they though Mexicans use a lot of hot peppers where the Portuguese use a lot of more garlic and stuff in the hot in the spicy food
 	
 	
 		a real lot
 		oh really
 		oh
 		so what do you like to make for you and your son
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh i like to cook spaghetti the kind that you cook the sauce for about three hours
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so it's real thick and all you know
 	
 	
 		uh my parents make their own sauce yeah it's really good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i don't i don't think i can go the the jar stuff  after after being spoiled by the real stuff
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and my son cooks a little bit he's sixteen he usually has supper cooked when i come home during the day so
 	
 	
 		oh that's great that's really good i wished i would've  cooked more when i was in high school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we're we're both in Boy Scouts we learned to you know cook out over open fire in the woods and all
 	
 	
 		oh that's great that's good to know sure it comes in handy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and you know like to cook Cajun food when i when i can get the seafood it's kind of expensive in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i bet yeah
 	
 	
 		but sometimes we had
 		see we went into one of the grocery stores the other day and they had uh Cajun blackened shark
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and i tasted it and it taste pretty good and the shark was on sale so i bought some and the first time i'd eaten shark and cooked in it turned out real good
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 		hm i've never had shark  and i can't see it any
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's first time for me and i didn't know i didn't know whether i'd ever eat it but i sampled it and it was it was all right uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good i like seafood but i hardly ever have it i haven't eaten it in a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah well you you live on campus or
 	
 	
 		um i used to i used to live in the dorm for two years but then i came back home i went to um
 		University of Madison Madison so when you  eat eat in the dorms you know there's a big cafeteria they have the food already prepared for you
 	
 	
 		um-hum  right
 	
 	
 		so i didn't i didn't get a chance to cook much and now that i'm home my mom's home so she cooks so
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but i i do i make some things you know once in a while you know get hungry enough you're gonna cook for yourself but i'm still i'd like to learn you know i it's i like to bake i make cakes and cookies and things
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		yeah i can do that but
 	
 	
 		okay i'm not very good at baking i'm you know good at cooking the main dishes
 	
 	
 		oh oh yeah
 		oh well i i'd like to learn how so it's one of my goals  i'm sure i will once i move out on my own
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah when i was living with my mother she she tried to teach me how to cook and i wasn't interested then
 	
 	
 		see i'm not neither
 	
 	
 		yeah and then
 		once i moved out i miss her good food and i don't know how to cook it so i'm constantly looking up recipes or trying to cook what what i remember eating when i was small and wished i'd you know i'd learned from her
 	
 	
 		yep yeah i should start doing that it it  takes a lot of time though doesn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah it it does
 		course my mother never followed recipes you know she just cooked to taste i guess most good cooks do that anyway
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		they just add a little bit of that and a little bit of this and it comes out
