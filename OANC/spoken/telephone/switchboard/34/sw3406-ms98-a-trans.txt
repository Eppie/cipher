 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what do you uh think is the uh the worst culprit for air pollution
 	
 	
 		well i think it's it's probably a combination of things um factories that that burn coal as uh an energy source
 		with uh sulfur and nitrogen contaminants you know and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh those are the ones i think primarily contribute to acid rain and i think that's
 		that's probably hurting us a little bit it's hurting you know other countries it's hurting Germany for example too and some other parts of Europe where they where they have high industry
 		so we're not the lone ranger here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's i uh it's hard to put the finger on uh what's worse you know the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion um
 		with uh your hydrocarbons uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		causing the damage in which
 	
 	
 		hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit but i know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot
 	
 	
 		well well i notice on one of these uh home shopping networks they were selling these uh halogen uh fire extinguishers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the halogen is uh an ozone depleter and it got hydrocarbons in there
 		it's a very clean uh fire extinguisher but it's you know really bad on the environment
 	
 	
 		yeah huh
 		yeah i guess i missed that one uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		automobiles of course are contributing too and you know how how we are with our love affair with the auto
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of hard to do anything about that i guess
 	
 	
 		i know uh in the Twin Cities area i just moved out of there and was kind of happy i timed it just right but they had a new policy where in order to get your uh your license uh your car license
 		uh renewed you had to meet the pollution standards
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		we we have that here too but it's part of the inspection sticker you know they put a probe in your exhaust pipe and and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's you know that's the way they're dealing with it here
 	
 	
 		yeah and yeah i guess that was just mainly in the cities there and i
 		as far as where i live i don't have to do that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have an old car which i doubt would uh
 		would uh pass the inspection a seventy six and
 		uh you know there's no way i would put in a lot of money to to repair it to meet standards
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it probably be difficult anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so although i do what i can to to cut down pollution
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i was just reading an article in uh Mother Earth News Mother Earth News Magazine
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh they've got a new um you know a lot of places are burning wood a lot of lot of people are burning wood those of us who have i've got a place in the country and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they've had catalytic converters you know catalytic converters on those on uh i think they're required in California and Oregon and and Washington
 		but they've had out those for quite a while and somebody's come up with a new one that uh sort of it's a it's a catalytic converter it's a catalytic it's a plate that fits in you know into the smoke pipe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh apparently it sort of feeds itself the more smoke is produced uh the you know after you get to like five hundred degrees
 		the the higher it gets so the the more complete the combustion is
 		and it sounds real neat i haven't seen them priced anywhere yet but that that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know old old uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		older stoves that don't have any kind of EPA requirements on them
 		that might help a little bit especially in some places we're really lucky here we have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now sometimes we get a kind of a especially in in uh autumn it seems like we get a kind of a brown haze sitting on us
 		but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well probably blowing up there to you guys
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well well around here our we get the well depends you know either in the
 		in the winter time it it blows it your way
 		and in the summer time  we probably get yours
 	
 	
 		yeah it comes back
 		
 
 		yeah
 		i really think that um
 		you know we're doing some some important things education uh raising consciousness awareness uh and i know school kids i work for school district here and uh
 		you know this is one of the big things with kids kids are writing letters to the newspapers about you know uh telling adults to clean up their act and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's uh
 		you know it  hope we're not too late with it we're
 		we're uh we're having all kinds of recycling
 	
 	
 		yeah well it it that's that's a a big thing too i i know it's has nothing do with air pollution but i kind of look at the way people treat our
