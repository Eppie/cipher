 		i'm i'm an electrical engineer
 	
 	
 		oh in New Hampshire all right
 	
 	
 		i work in Massachusetts actually
 	
 	
 		oh all right okay
 		so is everything going all right up there
 	
 	
 		um it's only about um half an hour i  live with on the border
 	
 	
 		oh well that's not bad then if half an hour we do that just going to downtown Dallas
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		see we live up in tax free New Hampshire and drive down to Massachusetts to work
 	
 	
 		that makes a lot of sense
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um we are you a native of that part of the country
 	
 	
 		yeah i i grew up in New Hampshire it seems southern town it's called Portsmouth it's

 		oh
 	
 	
 		that one little spot in New Hampshire we have ten miles of coastline i live on one of those that little ten mile spot
 	
 	
 		uh sounds wonderful did you have damage this year with hurricanes
 	
 	
 		not up um where i live but further down the coast in Massachusetts they they got hit pretty bad
 	
 	
 		i happened to be in Nassau
 		and we got the backlash of that thing
 		and they had record high waves thirty year high waves come in there and it was quite an experience so well what movies are you looking forward to seeing now
 	
 	
 		um well i'm i'm only twenty seven years old so The Doors movie
 		that's out on video i wanna watch that
 	
 	
 		okay have you seen Green Card
 	
 	
 		that would be pretty good
 		no i haven't seen that one
 	
 	
 		that's a real
 		warm movie it it really just turned out nicely so i would recommend that if you have a chance
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm in for it we rent a lot of movies so we we often sit around and say what movies should we rent and we don't know
 	
 	
 		well if you if you can get Green Card go for it
 	
 	
 		all right we'll try that one
 	
 	
 		i have been working at uh as an accountant at the medical school here in Dallas and i have watched um
 		Gross Anatomy have you seen that one
 	
 	
 		yeah i did
 	
 	
 		okay
 		and i don't know i can associate with some of the people in that movie because of
 		the young students i see over at the medical school
 		but i hope you have a very merry Christmas
 	
 	
 		you too
 	
 	
 		i'm looking forward to it
