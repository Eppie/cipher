 		yes  vacation spots
 	
 	
 		okay
 		right anything anything in the area of types of vacations you've been on lately you've really enjoyed
 	
 	
 		well i  i guess probably my favorite thing to do is to go to the beach um and my most favorite place to do that is San Diego
 		uh i love San Diego very much but this past summer we went to um  Gulf Shores Alabama and had a great time there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the beach was beautiful and and that was really uh a nice place to go so that's  that's probably one of my most favorite places to go how about you
 	
 	
 		well i'm a lot the same way we uh i was raised
 		well West Virginia but also Virginia and i spent an awful a lot of time on the Virginia Beach area and i sort of love the water i've always loved the ocean
 		so i enjoy going to the beaches myself as far as a favorite beach
 		um probably Myrtle Beach is as as more of a younger person i haven't been there for years i'd like to go back and see how it has changed but i enjoy
 		Myrtle Beach i enjoy Padre Island right here in Texas but i enjoy pretty much any beaches
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i've i've heard that Myrtle Beach is wonderful i have friends who think that that's the best place in the world i've i've never been myself but uh you know i've heard that it's a wonderful place to go
 	
 	
 		well i haven't been right haven't been for twenty years myself but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		one of these days i'll go back and see how nice it is i'm sure it's just as nice as ever as a as a high schooler and a college kid it was a great place to go it was the big weekend place and things like that especially in the summer the place to go in the summer to get a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you know a summer job and to spend your dollars and uh have fun and everything
 	
 	
 		sure well also one of my i was thinking another one of my favorite places is uh Santa Fe
 		uh have you ever been to Santa Fe New Mexico
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		well it's wonderful
 	
 	
 		oh i'll bet it is
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is a beautiful place and for the past two falls i've gone there i've made two trips to Santa Fe it's sort of becoming an annual thing for me uh i go by myself i go without my family and uh if
 	
 	
 		what do you do
 	
 	
 		uh pardon
 	
 	
 		what do you do while you're there
 	
 	
 		well  i basically uh
 		i love to visit churches there are wonderful churches in Santa Fe it's a real uh it's just a wonderful area and this past year i went to a fabulous uh monastery
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh that's out in the desert uh out in the hills of Santa Fe i also went to one of the Indian pueblos this past year and that was just wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah my wife would probably enjoy i mean enjoy we'd probably enjoy that also are you Catholic
 	
 	
 		no i'm not
 	
 	
 		okay we're we're Catholics so we'd we'd definitely definitely enjoy all the old churches
 	
 	
 		oh you'd really enjoy it then
 		well you would love it because i have a very great appreciation for uh the Catholic church and for Catholic churches and all the ones i visit are Catholic uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		one of the places  that i went to is a little place town called Tamayo it's out of Santa Fe
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they have there's a sanctuary there there was supposed to be some uh miracle healing that occurred there
 		and it is just a fabulous place i i  i just love Tamayo and it's about thirty minutes north of of Santa Fe and
 	
 	
 		oh no kidding we'll have to maybe give that a try sometime
 	
 	
 		well i'd highly recommend it particularly if you're Catholic i think you'd have a great appreciation for it
 	
 	
 		if you're a a water person my wife still says the best vacation we ever went on with our kids and as a family was
 		we went to one of the Jack Tarr Villages in the Caribbean and we went to one the one located at Puerto Plata
 	
 	
 		did you
 		Puerto Plata
 	
 	
 		and you know that's the most reasonable vacation we were ever on we just opened the paper one morning four or five years ago and it said round trip all included seven days hotel food all you could drink just every party everything it was almost like a cruise
 	
 	
 		ah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh it was like five ninety nine so we said let's do it so we packed up everyone four of us plus my son's girlfriend we all went
 		and it's probably not like i said not only the most reasonable vacation we were ever on and everything was paid for it was just glorious i mean the water was fantastic you get they had pools they had beaches
 		people were so courteous the lodging was fantastic the food was just like being on a cruise ship
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		everything from Baked Alaska right on down and all this for five hundred and ninety nine dollars it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i mean that's unbelievable the price
 	
 	
 		oh it is unbelievable and we keep saying that one of these days our kids are getting older now they're in college and uh be getting married and whatever so we doubt we'll ever have the opportunity to go back with our with our kids but but we're certainly going back but
 	
 	
 		with your kids
 	
 	
 		that's probably one place that we really enjoyed
 	
 	
 		now that didn't include your airfare did it
 	
 	
 		that included everything airfare lodging every meal i mean if you were a heavy drinker you could sit there and drink twenty five or thirty drinks a day or whatever you wanted i mean just it was everything
 	
 	
 		gosh
 		good grief
 	
 	
 		and it was just a a Caribbean type of surrounding very
 		tropical just uh entertainment every night i don't know if you've ever been a cruise ship or not but it was exactly like being on a cruise ship
 	
 	
 		yeah i've been on a cruise ship
 	
 	
 		and we were on four cruises and uh
