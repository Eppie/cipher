 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		this is the first i have used this have you talked to anyone before
 	
 	
 		only one time before
 	
 	
 		okay uh
 		i understand that we're supposed to talk about pets so do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		i sure do i was just feeding them all  i have a a large aquarium
 	
 	
 		oh what do you have
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		that sounds fishy
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		that sounds fishy
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		i don't guess you make any waves though do you
 	
 	
 		no  i've got i've got a lot of fish in my aquarium and i've also got a dog who is sitting out there in the rain wishing i'd let him in  but i yeah it's raining here
 	
 	
 		rain
 		where what part of town are you in
 	
 	
 		uh real far north just north of Addison yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really well i'm out in Garland so it's not raining uh well it may be raining i haven't been outside
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah it's raining out here and i just steam cleaned my carpet today and i really don't wanna let the dog in
 	
 	
 		oh
 		bless his heart what kind is it
 	
 	
 		he's a a mutt he's part Schipperkes and part Chow
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he's he's real cute he's a he can turn me into a real sucker sometimes but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		can he get in out of the rain
 	
 	
 		uh oh yeah he has a house but
 	
 	
 		oh he just wants to give you the guilt trip
 	
 	
 		well he usually spends all his time with us  the whole time
 	
 	
 		i see
 		oh well that's good that's good
 	
 	
 		so how about yourself do you have any
 	
 	
 		well i used to have a poodle and he died and so my neighbor's cat has adopted me so it comes in and to see me and i have it a bed made on the little patio outside and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i think it's adopted me so i think it's my cat now because i even took it and had its shots but because it's so friendly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh you're kidding uh
 	
 	
 		i was afraid she hadn't well i'll ask her she had not had it's shots so i was concerned so i took it and had the shots
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		that's not good
 	
 	
 		no it's a beautiful gray cat it's real sweet but anyway i'm i have to travel a lot right now in about um another year i'll probably get another dog because i'll be through traveling
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 		so you're a dog person huh
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think so i don't know how to handle cats
 	
 	
 		really i i used to have a cat and he actually he died this summer but uh i had him for thirteen years and when we got this dog i didn't know what to do it just i never had a dog before in my whole life
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was it's really different to have a different type of animal
 	
 	
 		well i i just don't know much about cats and i um i don't know why i don't they see to themselves i think more than dogs do so that
 	
 	
 		yes they do they're very self sufficient and they don't demand nearly as much attention or care
 	
 	
 		that's right they say you you um
 		have a dog but you what is the saying that you never really own a cat that you may own a dog but you the cats just kind of tolerate tolerates you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		well do you um um have your are you going to breed your dogs
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh he's been neutered
 	
 	
 		oh its just just for fun huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah he's just a pet and he he actually has turned out to be a great watchdog too so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		have you been to North Park to see the kennel they have over there this year that you can adopt a dog you know for the holidays
 	
 	
 		no
 		uh no i haven't well i certainly don't need another one
 	
 	
 		that's real cute
 		well don't go over there then because it really hurt touches you when you see those that are up for adoption
 	
 	
 		i know
 		well you know i went before we got this dog we were looking around and we went to um some humane societies and that sort of thing and they would not allow us to adopt a dog
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		how come
 	
 	
 		because we both work and they required someone to be home all the time and quite honestly i think probably some dogs got put to sleep that could've had a good home i mean
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well i didn't realize that because i most people do work now and uh that's surprising
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 		yeah and i was too and and also there you know they come out and inspect your property and make sure you have a fence it has to be like an eight foot fence and our fence only happens to be six feet i mean i'm not
 	
 	
 		but your little dog can't go over an eight foot fence
 	
 	
 		no no  i just
 	
 	
 		so did you have to end up buying him
 	
 	
 		yeah we ended we ended up we got him it was sort of a flea market but they had a pet store had a little shop setup
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and yeah we ended up buying a dog which isn't you know really what i wanted to do but i couldn't pass the requirements
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		isn't that i didn't realize that well did you go to
 	
 	
 		and yeah and i'll tell you my dog is spoiled
 	
 	
 		well somebody told me that the Richardson kennel was good or the Richardson
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		what do you call it where they pound i guess is real good about letting you have them there so i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i guess we should've tried the pound but the humane society uh wasn't interested in giving us a pet so
 	
 	
 		huh well that's terrible
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought it was too but
 	
 	
 		i don't know how long we're supposed to talk do you
 	
 	
 		um it's usually like five minutes not too long
 	
 	
 		okay so i well does it  does the recording come on or something
 	
 	
 		no you just sort of decide when you're done talking and that's it did you
 	
 	
 		okay  well do you work in Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah i work at TI yeah
 	
 	
 		oh TI i see oh so you're part of the program then
 	
 	
 		well i just found out about it through a different department um i don't know anyone actually well i i might
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
