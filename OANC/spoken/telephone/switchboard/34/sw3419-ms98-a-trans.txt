 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh Kate what kind of uh where do you like to eat out
 	
 	
 		well we uh we really like the Mexican food you know here in Texas and uh so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and so uh Tia's is probably our favorite uh restaurant there and i think they have the one of the best services that uh that we really like it
 	
 	
 		do you have you tried Mother Mesquite's
 	
 	
 		no where's that at
 	
 	
 		that's at Skillman and LBJ there is uh it's where Skillman uh curves into Forest Lane and it's real good Mexican food a another real good one is uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Raphael's down on McKinney Avenue
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they're both very good um-hum
 	
 	
 		really oh that uh no we haven't explored uh you know too many places um you know
 		a lot of the big name brand i guess uh chains uh yeah but um oh we've tried places you know down uh by the Collin Creek Mall the uh you know Alvarez and um gosh we tried what was across the street
 	
 	
 		chains uh-huh
 	
 	
 		El Paso's El Chico's or something yeah something something like that uh-huh uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh El Chico's or El Phoenix one um-hum um-hum um-hum well i like Tia's better than i do El Chico's or El Phoenix
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		uh much better uh Mother Mesquite's is one of our favorites but then fajitas are one of my uh
 		i like it better than just about anything and they make very good fajitas there in their own uh homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful especially with butter and honey on them
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		yes
 		oh
 		uh-huh uh-huh oh i know i tell i tell you what they they are they just um they're excellent uh excellent food i wish i could make them here at home
 	
 	
 		yes yes so do i  well what else do you like
 	
 	
 		just can't make those flour tortillas but
 		well i love uh i love seafood and i notice they have like the you know The Louisiana Purchase um Razzoo's has opened up down you know off of um um  oh close to 635
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes now i haven't eaten there have you eaten there
 	
 	
 		yes i have eaten there now the only problem i love the food it's a lot of cajun food and a good seafood but uh the service has always been so strange every time i've been in there mostly it's been at lunch time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh but i hear at night though they have uh you know the outdoor um bar and um uh that's it's really uh you know kind of lively so it's it's really good all their blackened grilled stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i we like uh uh for the cajun the spicy we like Atchafalaya's out on Beltline in Addison and it's a good restaurant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh well that sounds great
 	
 	
 		and fish for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincent's there in Plano or uh  i believe it's a Rusty Scupper over on uh uh Dallas Parkway in Addison which is absolutely wonderful
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the service is great they have every kind of fish that that you could imagine you'd want and the uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the atmosphere is wonderful too if you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh  well i uh i have children and and work and so we uh we tend to eat a lot of fast food stuff  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		fast food oh i can understand that i can remember when our children were small we lived in the Chicago area at the time and we had a lot of McDonald's when they were first coming out i can't look a McDonald in the face now
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i
 		i know i i'm so sick of McDonald's we we used to eat there we used to eat there all the time and so now we we we branch out at this Wendy's or some other fast food joint
 	
 	
 		i know
 		yeah  yeah well Taco Bueno's good  and cheap and cheap very cheap
 	
 	
 		oh and and cheap too so yeah but but the kids you know they they've got those expensive tastes so uh they like Tia's so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		yes yes yes sounds like my grandchildren
 	
 	
 		yeah i know they they they're just spoiled rotten but uh but no i uh uh we love to eat out of course it's just so much easier and simpler yeah so we uh we usually eat out generally two or three times a week
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh yes
 		well it's just my husband and i and it's either TV dinners at home or we go out to eat and i would much rather go out to eat than TV dinners
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh oh me too me too so i know uh i i know that i uh you know i just work and i'm just tired when i get home and i i just don't feel like cooking
 	
 	
 		oh no no
 	
 	
 		and uh you know on the weekends there's always things to do and uh so we like to go out to lunch on Saturdays especially
 	
 	
 		i like breakfast out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i like the IHOP there in Plano
 	
 	
 		yeah now i we've been there twice and and both times i just oh the food just didn't quite settle with me and i don't know what it was
 	
 	
 		oh really oh now that's surprising
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		because normally they're just they're real good and i like because they they're even if they're crowded they're fast service you know i i don't have to wait forever for a table
 	
 	
 		yes and i love
 		um-hum
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and we also like Owens uh
 	
 	
 		oh family restaurant uh-huh
 	
 	
 		country sausage yeah yeah we think it's good
 	
 	
 		now i haven't been there before i went to one i think in Ohio or or or somewhere up there but i've never been to that one here i know it's just down the street so now have you been to Applebee's
 	
 	
 		um-hum it's good
 		yes yes and we like Applebee's
 	
 	
 		yes yes i i really like that too so that was uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's fun i like your up there in Plano that uh Country Steak House
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i've been i've been there twice uh-huh yeah so
 	
 	
 		have you tried it
 		we like it because it's fairly reasonable and they have we go for the salad bar
 	
 	
 		salad bar yeah
