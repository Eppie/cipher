 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um they said to discuss the type of novels i read for enjoyment i like mysteries i i i really enjoy a good mystery i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm not into the gory bloody type murder things but  i like a mystery to curl up with at night and um do you enjoy mysteries
 	
 	
 		well i do i don't read much of them i i i tend to watch movie mysteries more than read mysteries i read other types of books but who's your favorite author in terms of mysteries
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		well i enjoy Victoria Holt i like you know that that era and that type of a a setting so i i that the the type of area that i read um what kind of books do you enjoy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		well  my my books are a little bit more uh  different than that um i tend to um right now i i do a lot of um reading of the mystic um
 		Catholic i do a lot of Catholic saints uh i do a lot of mystic um the
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		the ancient um writings and i've been doing a lot of that kind of reading and um so like Saint Francis of Assisi and Teresa Viola um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Teresa Saint John of the cross um those kinds of of writings uh sort sort of um old spiritual leaders um
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		it's been real fascinating and
 	
 	
 		boy it sounds fascinating
 	
 	
 		that that's been a lot of my reading for the past number of years and then i read contemporary people um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		who um combine religion and psychology and that's been an interest of mine and so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		right now i'm currently reading a man named Morton Kelsey and uh his his a book on it called Transcend and it's a story it's about prayer and um and it sort of combines uh some of the old um with the new
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh i
 	
 	
 		well that's fascinating
 	
 	
 		yeah i do that kind of reading although i do do some uh casual reading my reading lately has been fairly heavy but um
 	
 	
 		that sounds heavy  in fact it
 	
 	
 		it is yes but i just read i've read Prince of Tides have you you know that's going to be a new movie and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh yes
 	
 	
 		that's a good book if you yeah very good book
 	
 	
 		is it
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i would highly recommend it um it's not a mystery uh it it is of sorts and it's it's really it's it's fiction but it's an excellent book i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh oh that's interesting i it sounds like my my novels that i read i don't do that real often i'm like you i'm more into the self-help help and the
 		um of course child rearing i like to read about that i have four children and and i like religious books also and um
 		you know that that's interesting that that you read those type things are they are they hard to understand
 	
 	
 		it depends i think i've i've learned through the years
 		different books speak to different people and i say you know my recommendation is for people to try it and if if they can understand it they're supposed to read it and if they can't you know then don't try
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		put it away for another time um-hum
 	
 	
 		um-hum because i really do think it depends on on where people are at the particular time as to whether or not they can read it and for me on certain books speak to me and certain books do not so you know i i it
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i just think not every book is for every person these are not like you know best sellers so um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i agree
 		uh-huh now when you go to the do you get them from the library or
 	
 	
 		i tend to buy them at a place here called Dallas Books and it has wonderful um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		wonderful books and i tend to get them there i have i have a fairly expensive library now of
 	
 	
 		boy
 	
 	
 		of things that i have read um another person who's wonderful who's more contemporary but who has recently died is Thomas Murtin and if you've read any of he was a Cistercian monk
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and his writings are wonderful and he was a prolific writer and uh you'll see if you know the name you'll see it quoted often um and and he
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he's really quite good and i think his books are a a tad easier to read you know i think that's a good place to start
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um have you read Scott Peck that's another good place
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		he wrote this this is what started me on all of it was The Road Less Traveled that was a that's been a best seller
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yes i'm familiar that now i'm familiar with the title i wasn't familiar with his with his name but
 	
 	
 		well he um
 		he's wonderful and i recommend that book to anyone
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um that is a great place to start and so it's called The Road Less Traveled
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh i'll have to do that
 	
 	
 		wonderful book if you're into religious reading um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and psychology it he's he's a psychiatrist and he was converted late kind of late in life and it's sort of his story and it's quite good um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		huh
 		now do you um
 		when do you do your reading do you
 	
 	
 		at night i tend to read at night um-hum i have i have two children but they're eleven eleven eleven and fifteen so
