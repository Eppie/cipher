 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right this is my opinion i i'm still a student right now and i'm actually studying in elementary education i think that there are quite a few problems with the school systems today
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um more than anything i just believe that as students we're taught to learn what the teacher wants instead of actually um gaining a further vantage point
 		and so it's basically we're taught to be mediocre in what we learn
 	
 	
 		yeah  um i'm also an education major  i'm still in school and uh but i wanna go into teaching special ed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um i think there is a lot of problems in that area a i think there is problems all over the education system whether it be
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um elementary you know or even colleges you know have their flaws but  especially in the learning disabilities because um
 		a lot of times you know teachers think oh this kid's dumb and you know they just not too many people have knowledge you know about  this area
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		of uh
 		type of kids you know because it's starting to become new and and they're starting to find out more research about um this type of learning
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you're right i think that's really a a a really neat field i uh work right now in a special center for abused children and for some of the learning disabled
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's incredible how they they can learn quickly if you just find what's right for them
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and i think like you said at least in my opinion i think they put a lot of restrictions on teachers of how they can teach them you know
 	
 	
 		that's right it they're they hire teachers who aren't even qualified to teach those kind of kids and they burn out so fast they don't wanna teach them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there's not enough teachers who want to do that  and they're starting to find out you know oh this kid  may have a learning disability they test them and find out that they do and then it's just a growing field because more and more kids are being tested into that
 	
 	
 		i i think it's really interesting too i think along with the special children i have a friend who is gifted and in school he did terrible his all his years because there was no one who ever challenged or whoever found what exactly was what he needed in terms of learning
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i think again it kind of goes back to the same thing of you know being mediocre in everything that we do
 	
 	
 		right yeah like  everybody not just people with problems um learn differently i mean
 		you know one teacher can go out and learn how to teach but  they only know one way and a kid might have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		problems you know learning that and comprehending well what does that mean i think it's i think more teachers should um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		find different ways and be creative on their teaching
 	
 	
 		well i think you're absolutely correct
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you know i think personally like you said it it has  more to do with the teachers coming out of their shell and not being afraid to make mistakes and saying you know hey i'm i'm gonna try this If it works great if it doesn't i apologize
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i i found  in my own schooling that when the teachers made that special effort to to make the class exciting to make it different to to challenge my intellect or to to bring about a different method of teaching i was a lot more interested in learning
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		what do you think about the grading systems and and how those work
 	
 	
 		the grading system grading system um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think um well in a sense it's probably too easy but if it wasn't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um these kids you know i mean nowadays a lot of kids they just you know don't try they don't get the grades that they could
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i don't
 	
 	
 		do you think there's too much focus on grades grades instead of learning
 	
 	
 		i don't
 		yeah i think
 		well the field i wanna go into grades to me doesn't mean much it doesn't tell you how intelligent you are how bright you are you know um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		because i know somebody who's very bright and very intelligent but just doesn't get the grades and that's just because they have a learning disability um so yeah i think you have a good point there where they don't focus enough on them
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how they learn and what they're learning you know not on the grade
 	
 	
 		hm
 		right
 		yeah and i think at least as me as a college student i have a really hard time because you know they
 		when you go out for a job or whatever they're gonna focus on your grades and i think again that a lot of the school problems are more society problems where they're not looking at the individuals as much much as they are just the whole overall picture
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know like you said i i like the point that you brought up that that you said really it it needs to be individualized and i think as that happens more that the schooling will become better
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		right and that's hard with a a large class you know with thirty kids you can't give them all your full attention but and you know i i wish there was a way i'm not sure of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
