 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		back and whether you have the same feelings is that what you understand
 	
 	
 		yes ma'am that's my understanding
 	
 	
 		okay Jerry are you ready to talk about it
 	
 	
 		sure sure thing
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well the kind of enjoy uh dining out i enjoy is where i can have uh real good food and uh
 		it's quiet enough to to talk and go with friends and uh just enjoy you know just a relaxing time how about you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well what i look for in in a good restaurant is a combination of um uh atmosphere and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um uh tasty food and uh uh competitive price
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh uh in the locate locate where i live is there are several uh
 		good restaurants within a three mile area of our our residence so we we have quite a quite a choice to you know choose from
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		and um uh i guess the most the most i look for is uh
 		the the tastiness of of the meal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		closely followed by the the uh whether the place is clean and and um the the the servers are uh  how do i put it uh
 	
 	
 		courteous
 	
 	
 		customer oriented
 	
 	
 		uh yes yes that's gets to be the the catch word now doesn't it
 	
 	
 		because
 		uh-huh well that's they beat on us to be proactive out at out at the office so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i understand
 	
 	
 		if i got to everybody else does too right
 	
 	
 		that's right what's good to me is good for you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well we have this coupon book that uh some friends gave us for Christmas and we also look at the ones that are advertised in there where we can get
 		uh meals that we wouldn't want to go out and spend that kind of money for
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		at uh a reduced price and uh we found that a lot of the finer restaurants uh are chosen in that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i think uh
 		the neatest thing i finally got to go to one i wanted to go to for twenty some years for my birthday my husband made the mistake of asking me where i wanted to go and i told him
 	
 	
 		oh well that's no mistake
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's that's just fine uh
 		but see he did that on purpose because i do
 	
 	
 		yeah but he wouldn't he didn't know i was going to he said the dollar signs kind of marched around the page
 	
 	
 		well that's all right he uh you're worth it you're worth every penny of it
 	
 	
 		it was good though yeah
 		well i thought so at the time
 	
 	
 		well i know so my sweetie is worth every every penny of it
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		in fact about every other uh  anniversary i take her to the uh top of the tower
 	
 	
 		oh yeah but uh-huh the Antares well
 	
 	
 		that Antares the Antares restaurant
 		yeah Antares
 	
 	
 		this one that i went to was Old Warsaw
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i've heard about it but never gone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well save it for a special occasion the food is delicious
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the service is impeccable and they're not intrusive
 	
 	
 		huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the music is chamber type music and it um it's background type and then they come around and and play around in the different areas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it is expensive but uh you know for every for every special occasions it's great
 	
 	
 		well
 		uh-huh well for for two people what would uh an average meal uh
 	
 	
 		oh goodness  um probably depends on if you have wine
 	
 	
 		okay well  we don't imbibe so
 	
 	
 		okay so you come out cheaper
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um i'd i'd say at least put away sixty dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah okay
 	
 	
 		probably more than that if uh everything's priced separately
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and that particular night i didn't look at the price tags
 	
 	
 		well you're not supposed to on special occasions that's that's not allowed
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well
 	
 	
 		uh you're supposed to go and uh have a good time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know let let wisdom be the be the the watchword but don't look at the price you know uh what's well huh you know you have to walk a uh have a balance and things in uh in all things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		oh yeah oh yeah you don't do that every time
 	
 	
 		that oh that's true unless unless
 		you have hit uh Ed Ed unless Ed McMahon has delivered to you a a check for ten million dollars
 	
 	
 		oh
 		now if he does that i'll go there at least once a month
 	
 	
 		rogo um another neat place up close to uh the main the TI plant is the uh the Sheraton the Sheraton Hotel across from um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		the center buildings has got a real neato restaurant up on the uh twenty first or twenty second floor
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well i haven't been to that what what kind of food do they serve
 	
 	
 		oh well they have pardon me
 	
 	
 		just general
 		just general type things
 	
 	
 		yeah they have different uh categories you know the steak uh uh fish categories and i think there's some poultry and i'm not not sure what all but uh
 		every last bit of it was delicious and they was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when uh they first brought our food
 		i
