 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh do you have young children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i have got two one is uh two and the other one's four and um this is my first year of staying home i've always had them in child care
 	
 	
 		oh well then you are familiar with it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay i uh i have grandchildren and i know uh one has gone to a well two of them have gone to preschool and i know what the experience my daughter has faced with that why don't you tell me what you have found
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well um it was our second sitter the first one didn't quite work out um there were some things going on that i wasn't really happy with and so i felt that
 		that i need to move on with them and so i found another babysitter and she was wonderful except i thought that there were too many in the home
 		and it just seemed like it was so hard to find uh really good child care she was wonderful it's just that i felt that there were too many in the home it was in home child care
 	
 	
 		okay so you
 		okay so it was in home child care you took them to someone's home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh all right
 	
 	
 		well both times
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 		and then i worked in in a child care centers and i wasn't really happy with the particular one that i was working in
 		so i just always had a fear about you know child care centers so that's why i put him in a in a in home day care
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum  and then i just decided that i was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little and and i couldn't get off of work as often as i wanted to when they were ill
 		so i just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more
 		uh independent and uh i could go back to work
 	
 	
 		i know that in raising my children uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i was fortunate i
 		didn't have to work we didn't necessarily have a lot of things  but uh i didn't and know my daughter because she has three and
 	
 	
 		yeah  that's how it's going now
 	
 	
 		to have three in day care you know even though one of them's in school full time one of them's you know in kindergarten
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that is a lot of money i mean it's so expensive you have to really make a lot of money and i'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something and
 	
 	
 		oh no yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and i know that one of the day cares and it's a a well-known chain
 		um she was not at all happy with it because was there was too many children per person
 		they were just kind of left to play there was no structure to it and the middle grandson went there as a uh
 		like a preschool thing she was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of of learning and training and stuff not just there you know so he went like uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think he went
 		well five mornings a week if i remember correctly and um
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		you know and it was supposed to be a basic you know starting to learn the colors and and learning to associate with children so that when he went to you know a school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and stuff and uh she was most unhappy with it  there was no structure there was nothing to it  you know and uh she pulled him out of that one and put him in a another one that was excellent it was it was like a little kindergarten
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh they had hot lunches and and they had classes that you know one class they'd do art they even familiarized the children with computers uh it was just it was really a very excellent one
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh and how old is he
 	
 	
 		he's now five and a half he's in kindergarten this was last year
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so you know it helped him and and the first one uh
 		he went to a uh church preschool that was very good the Methodist Church in Richardson the big one and it was a excellent they very good it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		oh
 		yes my little boy goes to the Methodist um in Garland um-hum i'm real happy with that one
 	
 	
 		oh does he
 		yeah they uh the church ones church ones seem to be very well run
 	
 	
 		i
 		well i've i've heard that the Methodist ones are excellent even uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		even the  even their Mother's Day Out programs i heard are really good
 	
 	
 		oh i had uh i just assumed that most churches going by you know experience there that you know that they were good i i didn't know that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know i'm not that familiar i just know that you know First United Methodist there at Richardson was just a great program
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah because this is First United Methodist in Garland that he goes to and i'm real happy with that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah it's a pretty good size church too isn't it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah well that a claim
 	
 	
 		so
 		well are you enjoying staying home
 	
 	
 		yes i am  uh i taught for Richardson School District
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i taught early childhood and uh i really enjoyed it but it was just it was taking a lot of my time and i noticed i was spending less and less time with them and it just seemed like they were sick more often and i just couldn't get the time off to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children and have enthusiasm
 	
 	
 		yeah it is it really is yeah it really is and i felt
