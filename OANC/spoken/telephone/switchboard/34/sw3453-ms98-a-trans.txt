 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay  did they tell you our topic
 	
 	
 		uh no somebody else answered the phone and put my number in uh what is the topic
 	
 	
 		okay it's uh the topic is cars what kind of car will you buy next and what kind of decision you know do you
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		think about getting the you know to pick that car out and uh and why
 	
 	
 		okay uh my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac i've had uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well i'm on my third one and i'm not real sure that i'd be in the market for a car for quite a while
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm the same way i was uh i had two Cadillacs i went to my first Lincoln this last time i travel and uh
 		my grandfather
 		worked for Ford Motor Company so he always said why don't you drive a Ford or don't you try a Lincoln so i finally tried one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		my
 	
 	
 		after fifty years and uh
 		i've had i guess i guess four Cadillacs and and one Suburban in my last five cars but i bought a Lincoln and i like it
 	
 	
 		my
 		my dad has been a uh
 		uh Lincoln man for a lot of years but i've always been a GM man i'm in the auto parts business myself
 	
 	
 		oh are you
 	
 	
 		and uh the last Cadillac i bought was an Allante
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i just love it to death i'm not sure i'd ever get rid of it
 	
 	
 		well i'm a i'm a traveling salesman i travel on the road so i like a little heavier car so that's
 	
 	
 		i used to do that quite a bit myself
 	
 	
 		so that's why i
 		choose you know to drive a heavier car and more luxury car but i tell you what i will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly yeah because i like the Lincoln but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 	
 	
 		there's just something about that Cadillac that whether it's a GMC product or whatever seems they handle better and
 	
 	
 		they seem to put they seem to be put together a little bit better
 	
 	
 		i think so too
 	
 	
 		and you know the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products
 		and i think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from uh imports
 		is they put so much you know gadgetry
 		on the dash and and the the buttons are so small to push and GM doesn't seem to do that i kind of like that feature
 	
 	
 		yeah they really do
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you know i'm a i'm a funny duck that came that comes to the simple things like front end alignments i have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know why why whether i just seem to drive them better or what but i've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac they always appear to hold well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i've uh i had an Eldorado was my first one was an eighty and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think at about sixty thousand miles i finally had it lined up and i had them do all four wheels
 	
 	
 		did you
 		and the only thing i miss about a Cadillac is
 		a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car and i traded it in traded it in on my Lincoln and they're just not as large as before i do miss that
 	
 	
 		that's true yeah but what is big today
 	
 	
 		well you're right
 	
 	
 		you know Lincoln still as big as it always has been but
 	
 	
 		yeah it's big but the trunk space for me uh what i usually do is i usually take the backseat out of my car and that's where i put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough
 	
 	
 		you know a car i ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental
 	
 	
 		yeah now i have the Towncar and it's it's a deep trunk but not as broad as the uh the Cadillac
 	
 	
 		well the Towncar i noticed uh or with the with the Continental uh i was rented one one time
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh we could uh put golf clubs in them
 	
 	
 		oh good and it went all it went all the way down
 	
 	
 		you know straight across i mean front to back not going from side to side
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		and we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage
 	
 	
 		yeah i sell sporting goods uh hunting related items i sell guns gun cases and things like that and i need to you know it's about the same size as a golf club they need to samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that and
 	
 	
 		i see yeah
 		um-hum
 		i don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental
 		uh
 	
 	
 		nope
 	
 	
 		it's not as peppy as a as a Towncar because it's a V-6
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it uh i took i drove it from here to Memphis and i really enjoyed driving that car if i was going to buy a Ford product that's what i would buy
 	
 	
 		yeah i drove mine a couple weeks ago to our one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville i usually fly i drove it with another one of my guys that worked for me we drove it's you know ten hours to Nashville and it
 		it handled real well but my main thing is space so if a Continental i might consider it the next time a Continental has more trunk space you bet
 	
 	
 		you might take a look at them they they had a a lot more space trunk space as a matter of fact they had
 		more trunk space than my uh Sedan de Ville had
 	
 	
 		you always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs
 	
 	
 		um all three of mine have had leather interiors yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i like leather interiors also
 	
 	
 		uh i had a eighty Eldorado which was leather leather and uh then my eighty six was a touring sedan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it had the gray leather package in it
 		and my Allante has um i guess saddle saddle colored
 	
 	
 		that's a nice car
 	
 	
 		type thing
 	
 	
 		you bet and i'll and i will say one thing about Cadillac versus
