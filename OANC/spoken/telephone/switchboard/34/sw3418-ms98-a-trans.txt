 		hello my name is uh Donna Donahue and i'm calling from Plano Texas
 	
 	
 		yes how you doing did you uh press one
 	
 	
 		hi yes i did
 	
 	
 		oh guess we ought to get started i'm Phil
 	
 	
 		okay um let's see um i enjoy watching the Today Show early in the morning with my first cup of coffee because everyone is still sleeping i have three children  and
 		i enjoy watching the news because i probably don't have as much time as i'd like to read sit and read the paper  um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what about yourself
 	
 	
 		i like uh i would like probably like i think i like the Today Show on the rare occasions i get to watch it i uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh first one comes to mind uh without a lot of thought is uh Thirty Something which course is not on the air any more unfortunately  it was one of my favorite shows
 	
 	
 		um right
 		i
 		yeah i enjoyed that too i guess too also that was a nice one because it was  at a time when the kids are already in bed  um i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh yeah and i was gonna say uh I'll Fly Away which uh
 		i think it was supposed to uh catch some of the same viewers as uh
 	
 	
 		uh i haven't had a chance to
 	
 	
 		we've been trying to watch that it's uh not quite as good i guess you got to get into it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is it isn't it it set in a different era is it um was was it the fifties in the fifties or in in the sixties
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh it's about uh the civil rights struggle in the fifties
 	
 	
 		okay i didn't i've i've seen the commercials for it but it's not uh seem to be on at a good time for me  i try to stay away from horror movies i just dislike them totally
 	
 	
 		totally agree
 	
 	
 		yeah i i don't um  uh one
 	
 	
 		well i say violence and horror i just kind of lump them together
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's that's that's right and um with young kids in the house we just really try to screen a lot of the things that they
 		they watch um we watch a lot of Sesame Street  and a lot of PBS and the uh Discover channel or Lifetime
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah that's fantastic isn't it that Discovery Channel it's
 	
 	
 		yes it is it is it is wonderful and especially my  eleven year old is just fascinated by some of the the things they have on there um
 		what else i my husband enjoys watching a lot of sports which i really um don't particularly enjoy but  they're they're on you know i tolerate it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i uh i like watching the Oilers and the uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's about it i guess i'll watch that's about the only sports i really like to get into on TV
 	
 	
 		okay and um what else is there's a lot of things that i just can't believe
 		is even on TV you watch it for two minutes and think this is so ridiculously stupid
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well one of the good things is having cable they uh
 		they uh now uh you know the choices are so
 		so  good and so uh variety variety there that you can really
 	
 	
 		you you can change it  you know what is a good station too we uh subscribe to the Disney Channel
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i think if my kids were small small again we'd probably would too but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's a really nice and it they have um you know movies
 		that sometimes we'll sit and enjoy and it's it's really a very nice uh that was we dropped um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		HBO because there was just never anything appropriate on for the kids and now with renting videos so readily i mean you can just rent it if you really want to see it that badly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		uh it's kind of a
 		toss up there whether the inconvenience of renting the video versus uh  there never seemed to be anything good on when we wanna watch it you know
 	
 	
 		that's right and then and then they repeat everything so often too and or if it's on at ten at night well
 		i i'm asleep by ten at night i don't think i could stay up that late any more  um not to start a movie anyway
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah well that's true and uh then course they have the Pay-Per-View but our our channel uh system here in Houston is uh is not noted for being the greatest you know i think we kind of got the short end of the stick when uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		programming came around so
 	
 	
 		i see i see
 	
 	
 		they charge a lot that's four dollars and a half or something like that per per view it seems a little high
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it that does that does seem high but um
 		what other there's a i guess one or two sitcoms and the kids of course like to watch that new dinosaur show that's uh  which is pretty silly but but they
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		we used to watch uh when my kids would watch when the teenage kids would watch that uh Bart Simpson that was pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah once in a while Bryan watch that but that is more for an older kid than than the younger ones
 	
 	
 		yeah they were teenagers huh
 	
 	
 		you know so that that seems okay for them
 	
 	
 		i i like Roseanne that's uh  Coach
 	
 	
 		i do too i had to try to tell my kids that you know we don't really talk to each other like that i hope we don't anyway to make sure they don't think well gee mom
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		look what their kid just said said well but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and the kids like to watch that Doogie Howsner but that even that sometimes i have to shut it off and say and say it's an adult theme we don't need to watch that tonight we'll we'll get out the Clue game or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		or i'll suffer Parcheesi or something with them
 	
 	
 		at least you're exercising a little control
