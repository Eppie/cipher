 
     		
 	
 		oh now we can talk about that great team
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i think we know where we're heading well
 		uh well i just heard i guess uh
 		big problem right now on the other side Duke's trying to sign Sierra you know but  apparently he's gonna sign for twenty five at five is what they're saying
 	
 	
 		you you think he's worth it
 		who could be worth that huh
 	
 	
 		well
 		i mean i don't know i think i think i'm worth twenty five million if he is but uh uh
 		as far as
 		i mean if they're going to pay Nolan Ryan four and a half million i mean yeah he's definitely worth it just because i mean Ryan's only got a couple good years left in it where Sierra's got at least another ten or fifteen years but
 		i mean yeah that
 	
 	
 		i i think they'd be better off trading him off for two million and a half dollar a year pitchers they can win some twelve games each
 	
 	
 		well uh the problem is you have Tom House who is going to he'll blow their arms out i mean
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		and Sierra i mean those pitchers
 		you got a uh they've got to resign them just to keep the credibility of this franchise i mean because if they don't resign them i mean that's pretty much going to be the last straw they've kept Valentine Valentine way too long
 	
 	
 		i think you're right i i think that as long as they they keep that uh management team i don't think there is going to be a winner i agree with you
 	
 	
 		and it's you know i don't think i mean he's even said he he you know that probably will not not sign for as much as Bonilla did but i mean
 		because apparently he's he uh he's real into um Arabian horses and one of the minority owners is a big time uh
 		Arabian horse uh dealer or whatever and he's i guess there has been some he'd want he wants to stay out here and get some land and develop that because
 		i was listening to a show the other night apparently he he doesn't want to he doesn't really have the stomach to go into a large market and have to prove himself all over again but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he's got it made if he just stays there so he'll probably stay and
 	
 	
 		well i'd stay for five million bucks a year
 	
 	
 		oh i'll stay for a million but
 	
 	
 		they could twist my arm
 	
 	
 		you know if if somebody that's going to pay it i mean you might as well i you know can't blame him for taking it i mean that's
 	
 	
 		well uh well i i i don't either i i think uh you know the the whole
 		pro sports have gotten out of control and watch watch a game on TV they got so many ads to pay for the thing if i can fall asleep during a football game wake up and not have missed a missed a down for crying out
 	
 	
 		oh exactly
 	
 	
 		and that's the way baseball's going turn into it is they they have gone up to uh last year ninety seconds between innings instead of a minute and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they keep escalating the salaries as they are i think they're going to wind up with as much you know advertising as they do uh playing ball and uh it's going to eventually kill the golden goose i i think i
 	
 	
 		i don't even think it's America's pastime anymore i think football  took it over i mean i was a big baseball fan when i was younger but
 		i still follow it and everything but it's just
 	
 	
 		oh i i enjoy i enjoy them both i
 	
 	
 		there's just
 	
 	
 		i uh refereed football for forty yeah for forty
 	
 	
 		yeah it's the only thing going in the summer but football is definitely a little bit more exciting right now but i mean you know
 	
 	
 		well i think uh amateur you know high school and college is a lot more enjoyable to watch than uh you know football than than the pros
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		they're just sitting around i last Cowboy game i went to they were sitting around uh between plays so long uh i don't see how they can break a sweat for heaven sakes you know just waiting on edge
 	
 	
 		yeah that's one thing that's
 	
 	
 		and uh it it's too bad so
 	
 	
 		yeah the worst is when they they kick the ball off after uh when it's a commercial after they score a touchdown
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah then they got then they got another six more commercials
 	
 	
 		then then they kick it off
 		then the commercial after that they bring them you know that's that's the one commercial i think they need to eliminate
 	
 	
 		yep but they won't they they want the money you know the
 	
 	
 		yeah someone's got to pay for it but
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're greedy and they you know they all admit it's a business and that's what comes first and that's probably what the
 		is is a major problem with the Rangers they make money and they don't uh as long as they make money
 		and are respectable they don't make a you know they aren't going to pay the bucks out to be a winner and lose money and that's apparently what it takes  what it what what it's taking right now
 	
 	
 		well i think they're just hoping something happens to them like happened to Atlanta which is a fluke i thought anyway
 	
 	
 		tell you what i got i got to keep talking to you but i think this is my car guy calling on this line so we're we're we're probably almost done but hang on just
 		hello
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		okay uh you got another call
 	
 	
 		good did you get
 		uh well that's that's okay hang on a minute Andy okay just a second   we'll finish this off here
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i've been waiting five days for my car so he can wait a couple seconds here  that's uh but anyway i i think we've probably got a
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		situation that we aren't going to see a winner this year but
 		as long as
 	
 	
 		well i i just i mean  i've been a fan since i guess the uh middle seventies and uh it's just been the same thing every year i don't expect anything and
 		
 
 		i mean with the lineup they have
