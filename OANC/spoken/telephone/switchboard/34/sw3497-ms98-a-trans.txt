 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so how is the weather out there
 	
 	
 		um it's really cold and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		you have breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff how about you guys
 	
 	
 		hum um it's just it's a it's about same the usual i think
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so nice for skiing and
 		all that kind stuff
 		it's good
 	
 	
 		yeah well the weather
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		let's see well the snow here is different from Utah's because i've lived in Utah for like ten years
 	
 	
 		oh really what part
 	
 	
 		and um Provo i was going to BYU yeah and um the snow is like really cold i mean it's like really humid so it seems uh wetter or something like that than
 	
 	
 		oh really okay
 		it's more humid in Utah than there
 		or there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it's more humid in Iowa than Utah yeah
 	
 	
 		okay right okay
 	
 	
 		and it seems like when the winds blow it's real it goes right through you it's really different from Utah's weather i thought Utah was cold but i think Iowa is a lot colder
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah see that's how it is in Texas too because when it's cold it's really cold
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think there's any mountains to stop the wind
 	
 	
 		so
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		i don't think there's any mountains to stop the wind
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah so the humidity i think is what does it
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's true
 	
 	
 		because i i noticed when i got here too because like i'd when it would snow in Texas um i would just i mean we'd be freezing really cold and we'd have to get really warm and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing and you you don't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah it is true
 	
 	
 		you don't feel super cold it was weird
 		but
 		so how long ago did you graduate or did you or
 	
 	
 		um i graduated in nineteen eighty seven
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband got his doctorate at BYU so that's and so he just graduated this past year
 	
 	
 		oh so you just barely moved away
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah we really miss well we really miss Utah  we miss the mountains
 	
 	
 		huh do you like it out there
 		you do
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because it's like really flat here  well not flat but hilly and but no big mountains or anything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so you just moved away a year ago
 	
 	
 		um in August
 	
 	
 		wow
 		just really recent
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but um let's see
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		let's see what else can i say about the weather um
 		well today was warmer  it was like forty five
 	
 	
 		oh warm
 	
 	
 		so what's the temperature up today over there
 	
 	
 		oh man it's got to be like it's probably
 		fifty fifty five maybe
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		maybe not that warm probably about uh
 		um yeah it's not it's not that cold really
 	
 	
 		and whenever i remembered the weather reports in Utah i never really remember them talking too much about wind chill but they talk about wind chill here all the time because
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah
 		yeah that's a big deal in Texas too
 	
 	
 		they said it could be like six degrees outside and like negative forty one wind chill
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so that's something we're not used to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true that's makes a big difference
 		huh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so oh i
 	
 	
 		so did you used to ski when you were out here
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		did you used to ski when you were in Utah
 	
 	
 		oh i've only i've only skied in Utah once i've only skied once my whole life
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but do you do a lot of skiing there
 	
 	
 		well
 		um not tons but i like to when i get a chance i've only been once so far but had the opportunity a couple times since then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just saving my money for Christmas things and that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so is this your first year in Utah
 	
 	
 		um no this is actually my third year
 	
 	
 		and you're going to school there oh at U of U or
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yep
 		no at BYU
 	
 	
 		oh really oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so but i'll be here a long time
 		at this rate
 	
 	
 		what's your major
 	
 	
 		um it was nursing but i'm in the process of changing it right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh
 	
 	
 		because it's really really competitive at BYU you have to have like a three seven to get in so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		it's really
 		i'm gonna look into some other fields i'd like all the science classes and that i'm just not really enjoying too much so i think i better get into something that i can enjoy the process
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of going to school so
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		did you graduate in
 		a certain field or
 	
 	
 		um education i got a double major
 	
 	
 		in
 	
 	
 		uh elementary and special ed uh-huh
 	
 	
 		really that's what my sister did yeah you might know her her name's Lori Bird
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		maybe not  i think she graduated around then too though eighty seven probably
 		but
 		she got her double
 	
 	
 		yeah well i can't
 		there are so many girls in all my classes i can't remember how many people
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah because they just since um stopped that program i mean where you can where you can get it doubled pretty easily
 	
 	
 		oh have they
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i mean it's hard it's really
