 		that's what i called my cat was Sammy
 	
 	
 		really ha how about that same names
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you let your dog in the house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah she's about forty five pounds or so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah she's about medium sized dog
 	
 	
 		she like one of the family
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah you get up from your chair and she hops in and you never have the heart to kick her out because she's too friendly
 	
 	
 		when you go on trips do you take her with you
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah she loves to go in car she's pretty good too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah she just curls up in the back and falls asleep
 	
 	
 		yeah i think dogs are less destructive than cats cats tear up your furniture you know that's the only thing i hated about my cat he
 	
 	
 		yeah well she sheds a lot
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so we're we're constantly sweeping
 	
 	
 		and brushing
 	
 	
 		yeah well she doesn't like to be brushed though
 	
 	
 		oh that's too bad
 	
 	
 		yeah i know you brush her and and she walks away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's unusual most of them really they like those
 	
 	
 		so we don't brush her much
 		yeah that's what i hear but she doesn't
 	
 	
 		those brushes
 	
 	
 		yeah she can play Frisbee pretty good though
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah she loves to chase things Frisbee or ball or anything
 	
 	
 		we have a lake up here in the middle of town and went last summer i went up there and there was a dog chasing i mean catching a Frisbee and he was really good
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they'd throw it and he'd be right there on it
 	
 	
 		did he ever go into the lake
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		some of them do though
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think Sam would she's afraid of water
 	
 	
 		she's afraid of water
 	
 	
 		yeah she hates baths and she hates the rain
 	
 	
 		boy
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of those dogs they they'll you know if they're after a stick or or a Frisbee and they throw it in the lake they'll just jump in there after it
 	
 	
 		yeah i've never tried that with her there's a couple like parks around here with lakes but they don't let pets in
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		so she's never had the opportunity but i don't think she would
 	
 	
 		no not if she didn't like water
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well it's like the first time she might not knowing it was water but then she'd learn
 	
 	
 		what kind is she
 	
 	
 		she's a Shepherd and Husky
 	
 	
 		oh i'll bet she's pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what color is she
 	
 	
 		uh brown and black
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'll bet she's pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah it's like that's that's she looks really puppy like too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah the top of her is all
 		blackish and then she gets lighter as you go down
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i like  animals i live in an apartment now but so i don't like to have animals in an apartment
 	
 	
 		yeah we're i'm in an apartment now too and i'm the same way but it's kind of like out in the middle of nowhere there's big trees and fields so we can go out and run
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh well that's different see i'm right in town
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah that's got to be hard
 	
 	
 		no yard or anything and you i think if you have pets you really need yards
 	
 	
 		yeah you've got to have one
 	
 	
 		or a place that where they can run
 	
 	
 		yeah this is like one of the few apartments apartments around here that takes pets everybody here has a dog or a cat or a rabbit or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so they always play together
 	
 	
 		yeah they ask for those big deposits for those pets too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but she's worth it she's a good little dog
 	
 	
 		i have a boyfriend and he has this duplex and he's he rented it out to these people that had a i don't know had one or two dogs and they just they ruined the whole thing
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		they wouldn't go outside to go the bathroom they ruined the carpet and everything
 	
 	
 		oh i bet they stained all over it
 	
 	
 		oh they did it was awful
 		so he had to rip up all the carpet and throw it away they ruined it
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		yeah we've never had a problem with Sam because we'll go to work in the day and leave her and she'll just sleep all day and not make a mess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i guess we're pretty lucky in that way
 	
 	
 		yeah well it depends on the people too that make their pets mind
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i guess if you care about them they'll be better pets
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well when now when he rents he says no pets when he rents to people because of that one experience he had where they ruined the carpeting
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah that's too bad though too a lot of people with pets need a place to live
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		so how's Pennsylvania is it cold over there today
 	
 	
 		yeah it's getting there pretty cold
 	
 	
 		oh well it's really nice here
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet it is
 	
 	
 		except it's windy if the wind wasn't blowing it'd be really nice
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh we got the wind and the cold up here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's it's uh
 		it's pretty warm but it's real windy and it's cloudy
 	
 	
 		ooh sounds like here except colder
 	
 	
 		yeah i like the sun to shine
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm waiting for it to snow some because uh Sam really likes the snow we take her outside and throw snow balls at her she catch them all
 	
 	
 		well i'm surprised if she doesn't like water
 	
 	
 		yeah she doesn't like when it's raining she hates to go out when it's raining but if it's snowing
