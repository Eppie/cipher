 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what do you think
 	
 	
 		well um gosh it set up on a scale one to ten
 	
 	
 		yeah one being total control
 		total uh restriction and ten being none well i'm probably dead in the middle
 	
 	
 		uh you know i i think i would too i think i'd straddle the fence
 	
 	
 		because my husband's a truck driver okay
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he travels a lot of states and i'm always thinking of New York and all of them now they get New York and California's got New York and Washington should i say
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		got the strictest gun control law there is supposed to be
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it look what it done
 		it's it's nothing the people more people get killed in New York than than anywhere from guns
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		so the only people the only thing that i think gun control does to me is it keeps the normal people or should i say law-abiding citizens from having guns because the criminals going to get their guns
 	
 	
 		right right yeah
 	
 	
 		it's not going to do any good to now if they ban like the automatic guns and all that from
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		period then you know then if they catch them with one then fine but just gun control ain't going to stop them from having a gun
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		then then that you know
 	
 	
 		oh well see i agree with you uh it seems like the the crime rate has gone up even more um here this year they're talking about uh there're more murders in Dallas um almost uh since last year and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well the guy that broke in the store stole a bunch of guns and because the owner didn't have a a burglar alarm or something and that that to me that was stupid they should at least make him have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		an alarm or make it a requirement on them on them gun stores
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you would think  but they
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah so yeah but i i just i wouldn't want to ban it completely um but uh somehow there needs to be the one thing that i did like was that where you had to wait seven days um you know um
 	
 	
 		well
 		no
 		um-hum
 		well i don't mind waiting that's that that i could care less
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you know waiting waiting seven days so that they can make sure that check it out and everything's okay and to me that was uh that was perfectly acceptable
 	
 	
 		you know but
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know because if you are a law-abiding citizen you're not going to want to you know it's not going to matter to you if you have to wait a little while
 	
 	
 		hum-um and see the the the thing about it to me that they was talking about having gun control so people wouldn't kill anybody but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i am a true believer that if somebody wants to kill somebody okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't care if they can't get a gun they'll find something else
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it doesn't matter that they the only thing is is the gun is the quickest way they they had or they had accessible to
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but if they don't have a gun they'll find something else especially if they want or they'll wait on their seven days because they're not crazy
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yet i mean you know they haven't proved to nobody that they're crazy or they're in no federal no no no uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh what do you call it record or nothing so they'll get a gun then they can go kill somebody and then that'd be it
 	
 	
 		yeah  oh i agree with you yeah um
 	
 	
 		and then they still going to get it so
 		i don't think the gun control is going to help as far as
 		you know just taking everybody's gun away because Japan well is it Japan one of those those foreign countries has gun control but all the mob people have guns
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		yeah no i i don't think that they should ban it i really i really don't um you know i i don't have a gun in the house myself because i have uh children and uh you know feel really uncomfortable about that but if i was by myself i'd definitely have a gun
 	
 	
 		well i have a gun you know my well my son's fifteen but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my husband and me he knows that he don't even touch it and it's not a hand gun see
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's a shotgun so it just sits there
 		and it's in it's in my bedroom and he's not allowed in there anyway so
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		uh-huh yeah so that's that's a great
 	
 	
 		but it's not nothing that he can like  and that's another thing with these kids with these guns i blame more the parents
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		because i grew up with guns i guess you know in the house my father had a gun cabinet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but we wasn't allowed to touch it and Lord help us if we did
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 		yeah but see these people i know they keep them up underneath their pillows and you know sitting right on top of their dresser drawers i mean it's no wonder you know the kids get in there and then they blow uh other people away so you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no
 		yeah little kids in the house and i don't like that i don't like it when they have kids little small kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because uh when i have small kids over i close my door
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and my house is i live i live in an apartment so you know if the door opens i can see like what are you going into my room for  it's not like a big house to where's i can't see if they go in my room
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah yeah  yeah
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'll know if they go in the room because there ain't but two bedrooms so it's like right there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah so that um yeah but that that's about the biggest reason why i just never never and and i won't even let my my son play with play guns either you know not even get that idea about about them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think the only gun my son has is part of the Intendo  you know with the TV thingy that's about it because
 	
 	
 		yeah there you go there you go that's right there you go yeah me too
 	
 	
 		the the you know i don't i don't like that i don't that's that's i don't know i just hum-um but i don't think the gun control as far as
 		i guess i would probably vote right in the middle if if if there is a way to vote
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
