 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		and my my first question is
 		what criteria
 		is normally applied by parents when they are selecting child care
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what are they looking for in other words
 	
 	
 		well
 		well in my experience um i've never i've been fortunate enough to be able to stay home with my children
 		but um i have given day care to other children
 		and those that have come asking me to give you know to tend their children um i guess it depends on the parent whether they're looking for a preschool type situation where they want the children to learn
 		you know different skills and um school type things or whether they're the children are younger and they just want somebody to be there loving and nurturing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		what age would you say uh a child should be before you could start applying this business of teaching them a little bit preschool information we talking what six or seven or four or five
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um  in my opinion i would i'm
 		would feel that four at the very earliest i i think that children need to learn how to get along with one another and to play and to be creative and and to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		they do seem to have a very much improved uh intellectual sort of a spirit they're bright they look around and and they they know what's going that's that i guess that's as important to say
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i agree yes i agree in fact a lot of the kindergarten teachers that i've spoken with said that they would prefer that preschools
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		per se would be done away with and that the children just had a chance to you know develop the social skills that they say the the kids that come to school that have been to the preschool type settings
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um are are almost far enough ahead that they're bored with school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they need to learn to get along but um have you ever had children in day care
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to think uh yes we've had uh our children in day care a little bit but not much i  the interesting comment i was going to make was that when my children grew up i felt very normal and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with them and i didn't consider a lot of these little details that we're talking about
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but now that my grandchildren are growing up i look at them in a totally different style style
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i i watch very closely their activities when i see them and like and i can tell when they're speaking more clearly the next day and and when they are understanding situations more carefully
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i i don't remember doing it maybe i did automatically with my own children but i'm i'm just looking with a much higher technical detail at at the grandchildren
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh uh-huh maybe you have more time as a grandfather oh oh
 	
 	
 		well i wish i did i'm still working but i'll be retiring soon
 		it it's it's just that uh with grandchildren they are for a short period of time and you just look at them and you absorb anything you can from them and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you start reviewing comparing when you get from them with what you got from your own children
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but it was really a different environment
 	
 	
 		oh yes how many ooh that's been what probably twenty twenty years ago
 	
 	
 		
 
 		something like that
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well let me ask you this is it difficult to find a day care when you have a a specific criteria of your own is that is that hard to find
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		i think it is in fact i know that um around here one of the major problems that the working mothers have said they have is they will find a day care provider and then
 		she will stick with it for oh you know five six months and then have something else come up and so then they are looking again for another one
 		unless they go to the commercial day care providers and i know in the community i live in a lot of the mothers prefer just to have their children go to someone's home
 		and i know that that's um
 		there's a risk with that with the insurance and and different things like that but i know most of them prefer to have their children just in a a mother and child home type environment
 	
 	
 		i see uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um i guess it just depends on what you're looking for and whether you mind if it was myself i would rather have my children in that type of environment rather than the the big commercial day cares just simply for the fact that
 		there's so much illness that the little ones pass around and and you you know that type of a thing and the um
 	
 	
 		that's true yes
 	
 	
 		and i don't know what the one to one or you know what the ratio is for the adult providers and the children but i would think that if you had a small group it would be
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		that would be my preference anyway so
 	
 	
 		well my my daughter my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam Holland
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they have over there what they call a creche
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so her two children go to this creche which is a an all day well about a six hour
