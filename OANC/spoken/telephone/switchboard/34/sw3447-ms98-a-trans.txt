 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		way the way i'll go ahead and start the way i work i the way i dress for work is uh this year nineteen ninety one has been really suit and tie or i shouldn't say suit but coat and tie everyday
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a a year ago i changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which means uh kind of a i guess it's a different
 		set of standards i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i i dress almost the same everyday i mean pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it was very different before how would you dress
 	
 	
 		well i'm a drafter so i just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes and i have a sweatshirt on today  and that's pretty much the norm for me if i come in in a dress everybody's shocked
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i understand
 	
 	
 		they ask me you know what are you doing in a dress and it's usually i haven't done my laundry lately  ran out of jeans
 	
 	
 		right
 		i understand that's funny  so does it change
 	
 	
 		no no hum-um
 	
 	
 		your your dress no
 		so or do i guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that  so back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty i would
 	
 	
 		no hum-um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like but  probably once a month or so there was some reason that i would have to put on a suit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		presentation customer presentation or something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah  every now and then i'll get dressed up and come in but that's for my husband's job and not mine i have to go to a business meeting once a month with him but
 	
 	
 		oh i see i understand
 		uh oh well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		let's see uh what else about this
 		hm
 		it it seems like TI is pretty cut and dried with the two like two or three levels that there's the top upper management that always wears gray suits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the people that don't uh i don't know if you noticed if i wanna say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like i used to be in that research and i guess you are that we dress in the jeans and then there's kind of the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah middle middle of the road
 	
 	
 		but there's not much it's nice that there's not a requirement
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum  sometimes i think there should be some of these women around here look like they came off of Harry Hines
 	
 	
 		for it
 		oh yeah right yeah i guess you see those once in a while
 	
 	
 		and you know the they have the no shorts deal and some of these mini skirts you know are worse than shorts ever thought about being but um
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that's i guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right i guess that that isn't there a dress code something about spaghetti straps i'm not even sure what they are
 	
 	
 		supposedly and backless things but i've seen those too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh backless all right
 		okay so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation but i think we  we did it
 	
 	
 		but
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		okay and and your name was Lisa
