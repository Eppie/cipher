 
     		
 	
 		okay Mike i guess we'll be talking about painting recently any of kind of recent painting you've done uh yourself have you done any recently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we um remodeled a bathroom
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and which required uh completely repainting the bathroom
 		and the other project we've done around here is uh we've remodeled all our all our closets
 	
 	
 		wow wow that's that's quite a chore
 	
 	
 		which required quite a bit of painting
 	
 	
 		yes i imagine it did did you have that done professionally or did you do that yourself
 	
 	
 		no we did it ourselves did it myself
 	
 	
 		you enjoy that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh that's that's fun we just recently uh had our boys' room our two oldest boys share a room and
 		they're uh the paint has uh kind of faded and deteriorated and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth
 		and uh looks quite good we were quite pleased with the result
 	
 	
 		is this a project you did yourself
 	
 	
 		yes it's a project uh that i did yes and and uh
 	
 	
 		what what what brought about the fading of the paint
 		just sun exposure
 	
 	
 		well
 		i don't think it's sun exposure but um
 		boys will be boys and there there were crayon marks on there and we had to to scrub the crayon marks off of course try and get it clean
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah
 		latex paint latex
 	
 	
 		and so pardon me yes it was it was latex paint and that's uh what we put back on there was a latex paint
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		plus uh they had bunk beds and the boy one of the younger boys when he was younger about three years old got a uh got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures
 	
 	
 		on the ceiling
 	
 	
 		so  yes on the ceiling and uh you scrub and you scrub but you can't it all off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no that's true
 	
 	
 		and so that's one of the reasons why we painted and uh
 	
 	
 		did you go what what kind of paint do you use on the ceiling
 	
 	
 		we used a flat latex paint and in the bedroom as i understand that's uh one of the better type of paints to have because it's not so reflective and and glossy colored
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it uh turned out real real well
 	
 	
 		seems like um i've we've done some remodeling of some uh rental houses that we have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it appears as though that uh oh in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built
 		uh they used a lot of uh semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints it seemed like
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we had a occasion uh where we had to do some sealing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of uh
 		the ceiling of the this type of paint before we could paint it
 	
 	
 		oh you had to prime it and and seal cover over it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you had pretty good luck with one coat type paints you use a particular brand or anything
 	
 	
 		well i like to use this this Sears uh the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee yes
 	
 	
 		weather beater type stuff yeah
 	
 	
 		and the reason being is once i paint it i don't wanna have to go and do it another five or seven years later
 	
 	
 		understand
 	
 	
 		but uh and uh we're quite satisfied with that and and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale
 		and we do do that fact i was just reading an article you mentioned painting your bathroom
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i read an article recently that uh you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to
 		to peel or come off because of the moisture high moisture content in your bathroom bathroom
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a lot like uh wall paper
 	
 	
 		and uh did you have any problems with that or
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		well the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath so we didn't have a problem with that
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		um
 		i have had i've uh have never experienced that type of a problem
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh with a latex paint
 	
 	
 		oh good neither neither have i
 	
 	
 		so you shouldn't have a you shouldn't have a problem with it
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		they're they're pretty well refined today a lot of the paints  and Sears is one of the better ones
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah you
 	
 	
 		i've used uh many a gallon of them myself
 	
 	
 		do you uh have you ever used an oil base paint
 	
 	
 		uh used oil base paints for trim
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know like around doors and and on doors things like that
 	
 	
 		why why do you use that i'm i'm kind of learning at this new at this but
 	
 	
 		uh primarily because it seems it seems to be a little more
 		um what do i wanna say
 	
 	
 		it adheres better or lasts longer
 	
 	
 		well not so much that it seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		as opposed to uh
 		a latex type paint
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it just you know it it gives you a a variance even though it's the same color
 	
 	
 		right well that's good that's good
 	
 	
 		so it's worked out pretty well for us
 	
 	
 		um have you ever done any painting outside
 	
 	
 		uh quite a bit painted a couple of houses uh recently this summer we painted a uh out building which is a shed that we have on the property
