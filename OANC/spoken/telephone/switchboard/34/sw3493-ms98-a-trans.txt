 
     		
 	
 		yes we're going there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		on our way
 	
 	
 		well uh this is a good topic for me because i just got off a jury on Friday
 	
 	
 		oh i'll bet it is a good topic then
 	
 	
 		yeah have you ever been on a jury before
 	
 	
 		i have been on a jury once and it was an experience of a lifetime
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		really what kind of a trial was it
 	
 	
 		it was just a it was like a civil suit um and i really felt that by the end of it i had no respect whatsoever for our jury system
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really what what did you think was wrong with it
 	
 	
 		yep it
 		well we all had to agree it well we didn't all have to agree because it was a civil suit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		ten out of twelve had to agree and we had like twelve questions and the exact same ten people had to agree on all twelve questions
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's really hard i mean we deliberated for  ten hours and that was a long time and people got  with each other and i mean it just was not a good situation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		hm that's interesting
 	
 	
 		well and you know by the end of it i didn't feel like anybody won i feel like we compromised  compromised until we got to the point that nobody won
 	
 	
 		really
 		wow that's
 	
 	
 		what about yours
 	
 	
 		well i've been on two actually and the first one i was on was also a civil trial but it was real apparent to all of us what what the situation was so it was real simple
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um and we only deliberated as maybe three hours and we weren't really deliberating we were reading through the whole charge
 		and and trying to understand what the judge had written but i mean beyond that we really didn't have much debate um but the one i just got off of was capital murder trial
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and uh that uh um i don't know if it's fortunate or not i was an alternate so i sat through five days of the trial and it's sort of like seeing five days of a movie and missing the last ten minutes because i don't know what happened yet
 	
 	
 		oh because you weren't allowed to go into deliberations were you
 	
 	
 		and
 		that's right that's right and they also they can't report it on TV or anything so i don't know you know until it's completely over i won't know what happened
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so it was it was really interesting and and i can see
 	
 	
 		are are you real definite as to how you think you would have voted and everything
 	
 	
 		i i was leaning one way or another but i really needed to look at some of the evidence to make sure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it it you know it was fairly clear and i talked to the judge afterwards and you know and knowing what i know know now which the other jurors didn't know i'd definitely convict the guy
 		because he was he was found involved in two more of them and he was caught on the scene a the third one
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so it was it was fairly obvious you know that he had done it and eventually i'm sure one of the in one of the three trials they'll probably convict him if not the first but uh
 	
 	
 		but is this one the first
 	
 	
 		this is the first one they tried him on yes so it was it was
 	
 	
 		wow
 		where are you from
 	
 	
 		um i'm in North Dallas where are you
 	
 	
 		oh okay Plano
 	
 	
 		oh okay well this happened in Plano  you'll be thrilled to know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what trial are you talking about
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		what trial are you talking about
 	
 	
 		um well the one i was involved was at uh Warehouse Beverage it's on uh i think it's Fifteenth and Avenue K and the one he was later involved in was the Texaco one
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i don't know what the third one was
 	
 	
 		oh my well i'll have to watch the paper then when did they go into when did they go into deliberations
 	
 	
 		but the Texaco one
 		yeah that
 		on Friday but that was just the the guilt and innocence phase and i don't know you know then there is the punishment phase after that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		now is the jury going to decide the punishment phase
 	
 	
 		um well all they can decide they don't really tell say we want capital punishment or we want something or life imprisonment
 		you know if they find him guilty those are the two options for capital murder but they had six six choices what he was guilty of uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but all they can do there is three questions that they have to evaluate one being could he be a future threat to people well he's already proven that
 		but you know a couple questions like that and your answers are yes or no and if you get i think it is three yeses it's capital punishment
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or you can decide if there is mitigating fact or something to that effect but it's not like you go and say you know we we recommend this punishment you just say we answered these questions this way
 	
 	
 		wow
 		and that's what it that's what it leads to
 	
 	
 		and it leads you to the punishment yeah
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so it was really interesting and i wish i knew if they were still in deliberations but i don't
 	
 	
 		um
 		well it is it  when did you say it was Friday
 	
 	
 		so
 		Friday they went into deliberations but i don't know if the press can report at the end of the  the guilt and innocence phase or if they have to wait until the whole punishment thing is over because that will take another couple weeks
 	
 	
 		Saturday Sunday Monday um
 		i don't know wow
 	
 	
 		so but it was it was really interesting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you enjoyed yours then
 	
 	
 		well i it i learned a lot what i didn't enjoy was not being able to plan anything in my whole life because i mean as far as i knew this could take months some of them do
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh yeah some of them do
 	
 	
 		and that was the thing you know with Christmas and everything and i couldn't make reservations to go home but uh
 		you know now that it's over it was really interesting
 	
 	
 		who is the judge
 	
 	
 		um Nathan or Nathaniel White
 	
 	
 		Nathaniel
