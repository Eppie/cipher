 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what do you like to read
 	
 	
 		uh i read about just anything that i can get my hands on
 	
 	
 		you sound like me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if it's printed i'll read it
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah it's amazing to me the people that uh i've i've got a brother and sister-in-law that uh like whenever i go to visit them i'll always have to be sure and carry a book with me because there's nothing to read in their house and i go crazy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i i pretty much carry my own reading material too i mean i'll uh i'll be walking to work i mean walking to the elevator to work and i'll be reading a book on the way up in the elevator and everybody laughs at me
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah well i i went to the library yesterday looking around and i found this uh new book by PJ O'Rourke called uh uh Parliament of Horrors and it's about uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's a  humorous humorous attence attempts to explain the entire US government and it's really cute
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but anyway he wrote for Rolling Stone magazine for years and years i think he still does
 	
 	
 		uh-huh is it a is it a satire or
 	
 	
 		it is very much a satire
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i like i said i i i gosh i can't remember the last book i bought but i've read so many and any book my mother usually has a stack at her house so i'll go and pick up one over there and
 		or several actually and just get through them one by one mostly i like i don't know
 		i suppose
 		uh mystery or history true history
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that type of thing
 	
 	
 		most ladies do like mysteries a lot i have i have a friend too is a voracious history buff she just she reads one history
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		book after another and and i was telling her about the library here in Houston that has uh one particular library that has all of the mysteries arranged in one area uh
 		and then another one that while they're not arranged in one area they do they have question marks on the covers to indicate that they're mysteries and she said oh that sounds like heaven to her so she wouldn't have to have to look for them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		that's true
 		no i can't say that i've been to the library lately i've found quite a bit i mean i'm either reading a newspaper or a magazine or like i said anything i can get my hands on
 	
 	
 		yeah the only problem that i've got now  is that uh i take a daily paper and then i've got oh i don't know four or five magazines coming in and then of course i've always usually i'm in the middle of two or three different books at the same time
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and i've found lately that uh that i i feel  God for some reason i feel kind of bad about it but i'm not able to get through the newspaper i mean and i and and then if i'm not finished with it i don't want to throw it away and then all of a sudden it's the next day and then it's the next day
 	
 	
 		uh uh-hum
 	
 	
 		my kitchen counter is covered with magazines newspapers so i finally just you know make a run to the dumpster
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		i uh i well i end up just picking out key sections and reading those and the rest of it if i get to it fine if not
 	
 	
 		hm yeah
 		yeah the only really the only the only day that i just uh devour it cover to cover is on Sunday but that's sort of a ritual with me get the coffee and a bran muffin and the newspaper and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the turn on the stereo and i'm just i'm i'm set for about an hour
 	
 	
 		an hour is that all
 	
 	
 		well maybe a little more at least an hour at least an hour
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well i know my dad gets both i mean he gets the two Dallas papers here and he he sits down for at least about
 		three so me i don't know i don't i don't sit specifically sit down on Sundays to read the Sunday papers sometimes i don't get to it till like Wednesday
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah well that's the good thing about the Sunday paper though they have so many articles that aren't necessarily uh you know you don't feel like they're
 	
 	
 		but eventually
 	
 	
 		old if you don't get to them that on that one day
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		well i uh i don't know i had bought books for years and years and uh the last time i moved when i was transferred to Houston i uh filled up
 		one big closet with books because where i live now doesn't have a bookshelf doesn't have doesn't have the book shelves that i had in Dallas where i moved from
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i don't know see i've i've just i've got such so many books and moving them was such a pain that i've really
 		stopped buying so many and i started going to the library again which uh i hadn't done in fifteen years you know and it was kind of like an awakening i thought you know gosh this is free it's amazing so but i've enjoyed it  and i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		it's it's really a much better idea it's a bit inconvenient for me but i've i've always told myself i'd do that because
 		i don't know i get the books and then after i read them if i really like them i'll keep them but if if not you know it's it's wasted space for me so i end up giving them away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but um i've got
 		i'm kind of sort of surrounded i've got three different libraries that are within oh i don't know it's uh  i guess the furthest one away is maybe two miles one of them's only about a half mile away the other one's about a mile and a half
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		and it and one in particular stays open until uh nine o'clock
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		Monday through Friday so it's you know it's great and that makes it it it you know if they were just regular hours then it would be difficult because i'm
 		usually work pretty late at the office but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		anyway that uh i still like to go to the bookstores and browse around but uh
 	
 	
 		well i'll i'll read the reviews
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and if they end
