 		oh no
 		oh gosh oh gosh i look
 	
 	
 		well anyway we've got a easy subject
 	
 	
 		yes we do

 		okay let me think here favorite shows i haven't been watching much TV lately  i used to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah you know you get so busy
 	
 	
 		yeah i have uh let's see i have one favorite soap opera i still watch and i tape if i'm not home  and uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		let's see that's General Hospital and then uh at night i don't um when i sit down i don't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock when my kids get in bed and
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		and and uh then i watch uh what do i watch at nine o'clock let's see oh well Tuesday nights i guess we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like and uh
 	
 	
 		right are they little
 	
 	
 		i have a seven year old and a ten year old
 	
 	
 		yeah they're pretty young
 	
 	
 		and uh so we usually catch uh Full House and uh
 		what's the one comes on after that it's a new one um
 	
 	
 		i don't know my kids are older so i don't i don't know some of those shows now like i used to  yeah
 	
 	
 		three something
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah uh other than that uh oh gosh i watch Knots Landing on Thursday nights for pure entertainment nothing else yeah
 	
 	
 		right well i like i like the comedies they're just light too i have to watch Murphy Brown i really like
 	
 	
 		oh now that is a good one that is a good one if i'm home on Mondays then i i definitely watch her
 	
 	
 		i make a point of that
 		i love that and i really like Coach i think it's when it's good it's just a scream
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well he's such a good actor he really is good
 	
 	
 		uh well he's probably playing himself half the time you see these people on an interview show they're they act just like they do in their parts  he i saw him on Johnny Carson once and he acted just about the same
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh gosh well he could very well be  so do you watch much TV or
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh
 		well i watch more now because well i i had been going to school for years and have really been too busy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but this semester i'm only taking one course and so i see Murphy Brown and Coach and The Wonder Years i just make a point of seeing those
 	
 	
 		now i never see that oh i've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show
 	
 	
 		oh it's fabulous really you should never miss that it they are just gems of shows i mean they're really uh fabulous in every way
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		what now what night is that on now
 	
 	
 		oh that's Wednesday at uh seven thirty
 	
 	
 		Wednesday at seven thirty oh okay yeah Wednesdays i i go to church choir so  that's my one night out and about so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		sure yeah well maybe your maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime just so you get the idea it wouldn't take much wouldn't take much to get hooked on those
 	
 	
 		yeah i should get him to do that because i know
 		yeah yeah uh-oh
 	
 	
 		so so i watch those and
 	
 	
 		are there any new ones this year that came out that you like or
 	
 	
 		well you know i haven't oh yeah we started watching Northern Exposure well it's not really new but it's still kind of new and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh how's that i haven't seen that
 	
 	
 		i like it a lot it's real different in fact they never thought it would be a hit
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i mean they'll have some things in there that almost almost you know like supernatural or something you know i mean somebody will
 		see a figure from the past that nobody else does or i mean it sounds weird but it's it's a very very uh unique show and very well done excellent actors
 	
 	
 		ah
 		huh
 		i'll have to watch for that one sometime
 	
 	
 		i i guess we just it came on after something we used to watch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i guess we just kept sitting there and then now we make a point of watching i can't take all these shows on because next semester i'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television
 	
 	
 		so gosh
 		uh-oh
 	
 	
 		well then it will be mostly reruns i guess  it's uh by the end of February the way they do it nowadays
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um gosh well we used to watch a lot of Designing Women but uh i haven't seen that much lately since they got rid of uh Delta Burke and  brought on the new ones
 	
 	
 		but um
 		yeah
 		yeah i've seen that
 		was she the was she the best one was she the best one on that old show
 	
 	
 		oh she was just funny she was really funny and her character was good i don't know that it was her in particular it was just the character so um
 	
 	
 		really
 		right right
 		yeah they had a big fight on that show didn't they they were all accusing each other of everything in the world
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh that was awful and who knows still what happened really happened you know
 	
 	
 		well i know you know gosh you never will probably
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		well well i think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable i don't have cable
 	
 	
 		oh i know now i told was gonna no we don't have that station either so uh i haven't been able to catch any of that but just what little we caught on the news
 	
 	
 		i mean it's just as wild as any soap opera from what i hear on the news and i think he's guilty as the devil
 	
 	
 		oh i know it
 		well i don't see how he couldn't be you know
 	
 	
 		i know what's in it for her is there's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that because you know they tear you to shreds especially those rich high powered lawyers
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 		oh and they said this lawyer is unbelievable but they said she held up so well yesterday
 	
 	
 		um
 		i know everybody was saying that and then in the paper said it so it should be interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		well the National Enquirer says  i was reading that in the supermarket line i never have the nerve to buy the thing uh
 	
 	
 		oh shoot well do you watch any uh any sports or anything like that or
 	
 	
 		says he
 		hum
 		no i don't care anything about that
 	
 	
 		because i don't either i can't i can't watch it on TV so uh
 	
 	
 		um i like the ice skating you know occasionally some ice skating will come on on a Sunday or the during the Olympics i always watch that i think it's so beautiful
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i like to catch the gymnastics sometimes too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's good it might
 	
 	
 		just to
