 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all of our children are um
 		uh well two of them are back in the house now but they're all grown twenty one and over
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		and how did you spend time with them when they were young
 	
 	
 		i guess like everybody else soccer games and all sorts of games and carpools and
 		traveling and um they we seem to be together enough
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well
 	
 	
 		um was there was always one parent here at least because um we'd never usually leave together
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i usually work teach at night and my wife was here in the daytime and i mean at night and then i was here most of the day if they were when they were here so
 		they didn't spend a lot of time by themselves
 	
 	
 		how many children do you have oh um-hum
 	
 	
 		three
 		two girls and a boy
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i had two boys and i'm a grandmother now so my children are grown also and they live away from me so i don't see them much but
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh you are
 		well we had uh that those they were all away and now there's uh one's coming back from college and the other one has just graduated and stayed back home so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i i tried to spend a lot of time with my children when they were young we spent lot of value time um creating things and
 		building things together i feel the families watch too much TV today
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh absolutely yeah that's the truth we didn't have a TV for three and a half years when they were in school early school for some reason and they did so much better and then we went back to TV's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you can just see it that
 	
 	
 		well i tried to put a limit on it when they were in school to so they could only watch so many hours per day of TV so
 	
 	
 		um-hum where'd your kids go to school
 	
 	
 		well we traveled we moved around quite a bit so they went to a lot of different schools
 	
 	
 		oh
 		they weren't here in north Dallas huh oh
 	
 	
 		no
 		they did go a year in Palestine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but we did move around quite a bit so
 	
 	
 		yeah well i don't know that i i just uh that's that that TV's probably one of the problems and then both parents working and
 	
 	
 		but
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh that's a i don't think a good situation but i don't imagine it'll change
 	
 	
 		i don't think so either it takes two incomes now anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		but i feel that i didn't get to spend as much time with my children as i could have
 		or as as i should have i i was a working mother and
 	
 	
 		you probably didn't if
 		that's right if you had to work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh it's just almost impossible
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		especially when they get up to the age where they have so many things they want to do on their own so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i remember the things that they really liked my oldest son he liked kites he always wanted always building kites and working on those he loved kites
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so uh well my all three of mine ran sports so we spent an
 		time lot of time with their different sports activities because they all played and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now they're all in college or one two one out and two in still in college so
 	
 	
 		well mine they were in the music end of it instead of sports they did my oldest son did play a little football and soccer but i had them in the band they were playing horns in the band
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		so well we probably if they're alive and kicking we probably did did a decent job
 	
 	
 		yeah nobody's perfect all you can do is your best and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		shit absolutely
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		anyway well
 	
 	
 		well i have three grandsons now and i one of them uh two of them's in California and one of them's in Arizona and i'm gonna get to see them at Christmas time so
 	
 	
 		oh great yeah
 	
 	
 		i uh it's gonna i'm gonna enjoy that
 	
 	
 		i would hope so
 	
 	
 		they're all little they're little kids so but i bought little things for them to work on and to try to keep them busy um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah that will be
 		yeah that'll
 		that'll be fun look forward to that you're gonna fly out there
 	
 	
 		no i'm going to drive to Arizona uh hum
 	
 	
 		oh you are
 		ooh i've done that a few times
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's a tough drive
 	
 	
 		it's worth it to see my family
 	
 	
 		sure you just gonna try to spend spend the the
 		uh spend the night somewhere
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well we always stopped at Pecos that seemed like like it was a good

 		oh yeah well that'll be great
 		so well anyway it's good to talk to you
 	
 	
 		well the they won't be be upset with us if we hang up too soon
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't know i think
 	
 	
 		i haven't done that before usually i talk and talk and talk
 	
 	
 		they usually come on and say something don't they
 	
 	
 		uh yeah when our five minutes are up
