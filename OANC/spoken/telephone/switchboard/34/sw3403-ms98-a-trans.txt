 
     		
 	
 		well what's your favorite baseball team Rita
 	
 	
 		well i suppose i supposed to say the Rangers right  is that what i is the million million dollar question here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well this isn't a a a true false or right or wrong test here
 	
 	
 		yeah uh um you know i would like to say the Rangers but  unfortunately they're not i was from Illinois and my favorite team was the White Sox
 	
 	
 		not a Cubbies fan huh
 	
 	
 		no no my family my dad was but i turned out to be a White Sox fan
 	
 	
 		well that's all right how do you expect them to do this year
 	
 	
 		lived in Chicago yeah they did pretty well
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		what'd you think the World Series
 	
 	
 		well
 		i'll tell you i just uh
 		moved down from South Dakota in July
 		and uh in South Dakota the Minnesota Twins are the closest
 		professional sports team to where i was living
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so everybody was a Twins fan and i was  kind of
 		uh didn't have much interest in the Twins you know it was it was kind of pathetic i mean we only had two radio stations
 		and one of them broadcast every Twins game live you know  and the other one was country
 	
 	
 		so you didn't really have a lot of choice did you
 	
 	
 		so that's right it was Twins there or you know Skip Williams
 	
 	
 		or country
 		yeah oh uh and i was routing for the Twins
 		myself because uh they a couple of Ranger players that i had
 		watched when we first moved here uh went to Minnesota and we used to tease about my son and i used to have a bet going
 		because about some of the players that had moved from here to Minnesota but it was interesting it certainly was an exciting series anyway
 	
 	
 		it sure was it sure was
 	
 	
 		what do you think's gonna happen to the Rangers how can we predict
 	
 	
 		well i would
 		i would like to assume assume assume that they're gonna do do better this whole this coming year i would sure hope so anyway when we moved down
 		uh i was able to go to my first you know baseball game and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		thought this is great this is incredible so i i became a Rangers fan
 		i i didn't really have one in South Dakota so i adopted the Rangers or rather they adopted me i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it was just exciting you know you can watch baseball on TV and they hit the long ball and it looks like wow they really hit that ball
 		but when you go to the ballpark it's really not all that far
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		you know and it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you and
 	
 	
 		oh isn't it though you know but oh i i think going to ballpark it really really makes it because then you watch it on TV you feel like you're more a part of it too
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		you know well i'm a great sports enthusiast so i love
 		you know baseball teams and they in fact on the news tonight Nolan Ryan was on there he was being he was put in the which i'd never knew exist the Restaurant Hall of Fame
 	
 	
 		the Restaurant Hall
 	
 	
 		the Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		he uh says he's coming back you know and he doesn't know how many years i mean to pitch he'll be at least one more and he said he's been saying one more and it's been two and three might be two and three more  he likes it
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right and he's still doing great still doing excellent
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right you know and he said i get a kick out of it uh you know he's he's such a nice man
 	
 	
 		well didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers
 	
 	
 		yeah and he you know when he quits at being active he will go into you know being a managing and yeah you know being a coach i'm sure
 	
 	
 		management
 		right
 	
 	
 		but he's uh he certainly is a good example uh for the kids
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know you like to have someone like that you could point to to say see what a fine man that he is
 	
 	
 		you know some of the
 		like uh
 		Ivan Rodriguez wasn't even born when when uh Nolan Ryan started pitching
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and it's just incredible to think that there's uh there are players
 		who are the sons of ballplayers that used to play against Nolan or with Nolan
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and now their sons are
 	
 	
 		oh he's been a legend for so many years you know and i don't know were you here
 		had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at UT with his son his son pitched for UT and he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers
 	
 	
 		huh-uh i wasn't
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a i think it was a a little early part of the summer and uh
 	
 	
 		was it Nolan against uh oh it it was Ryan against Ryan huh
 	
 	
 		Nolan against
 		Ryan against Ryan yeah his son pitched for UT
 	
 	
 		well that is neat
 	
 	
 		and uh only uh Ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want the son getting too nervous about this whole thing game is a game you know well the Rangers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		really uh
 		knocked the socks off of them which you would expect you know anyway but Nolan i think took himself out after a couple of innings or something
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know of the game to let
