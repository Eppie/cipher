 		put up some kind of a structure to house that pony because he a stall because he brought the pony to my children

 		and that pony lived with us for about twenty five years and uh the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		his name is Sandy and he was a champion jumper in Chicago
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it turned out that my brother-in-law's daughter had had a ponies in a at a certain place out there and it caught on fire and they they got out there and got all the ponies out and these people were so happy that they gave her this pony for saving the rest of them

 		my goodness you are a busy lady with two ponies and three dogs
 	
 	
 		three dogs no cats
 	
 	
 		i'm yeah i'm afraid the cat would be scared to death i'd i have i have a cat a pony a cat pony i have a cat also whose name is Babe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it used to be in the old days i had uh
 		mothers and father cats you know and then we'd have a of six or eight and litters around and so forth and this is the only one that's left from the whole big batch that uh lived through the years when my children were at home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now the pony has died the dog has died and the three children have moved out and have their own homes and so  my wife and i and Babe are the ones left on the farm now
 	
 	
 		the dogs died
 		and you've and you
 		are you gonna are you gonna get another dog or any more pets
 	
 	
 		we are so busy right now trying to take care of ourselves that uh i don't know how we can handle any other pets right now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if things ever calm down why we'd like to have pets again i i enjoyed uh Gena she was a very sweet dog but i hate to have her she was an outside dog and i hated to have her on a chain all of her life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but that's basically what she had to do we could let her loose and let her run oh for an hour or two every day but we had to make certain she didn't get off the property or get up to the highway and
 	
 	
 		see my three are in in anywhere they wanna be dogs they're they're indoor uh they always sleep indoors
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh well mine mine have always slept outdoors
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		and well they had their own house
 	
 	
 		dogs are dogs are um at least dogs are um uh pack animals and uh you are their pack
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		yep they certainly depend on you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh my dog Gena as i say she had her own house and she was warm and comfortable in there and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		other times why she could go in the in the barn with the pony and uh they got along fine  so they had their own great big house back there i have several other acres of ground that i normally planted corn
 	
 	
 		yeah  uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i have a big enough building back there i had to build this new building to put the pony in the little one i built only lasted about two years and so he had to move into his new castle
 	
 	
 		oh goodness
 		
 
 		yeah
 		a barn with  the hay and everything else in it the feed
 	
 	
 		yes he had the works so i'm sure that uh Sandy had a a good life he was fed twice a day and had his own two acres to roam in and to graze and so forth
 	
 	
 		um
