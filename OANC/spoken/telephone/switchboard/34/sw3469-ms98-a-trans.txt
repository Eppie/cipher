 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well what do you think about it
 	
 	
 		uh well immigration i know they're really strict right now because my hundred husband is from out of the country and uh
 		we had to go through a whole very long process to uh to assure the government that he was uh marrying me and not to be a resident here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's interesting yeah i think that's uh i think it's a little crazy i worked with Spanish people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for about two years and just it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true i mean you can't just come over to the country because uh you want to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know that's not good enough you have to have a have to have a darn good reason of political or whatever
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right exactly
 	
 	
 		it's not a good not a good easy way to get in
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you know i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to to protect you know the people who are in the states
 	
 	
 		exactly my mother uh actually knew a woman uh in another state that used to marry men just never she'd never even meet them and she'd just get money for it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh you're kidding
 	
 	
 		huh-uh so uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sounds like a lot of fun yeah it's amazing to me how how many things they would allow
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		to occur before you know you can come in and
 	
 	
 		exactly but i mean with the new laws it's really it's tough now
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah it's kind of frustrating too for those who are legitimate now you know i think
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		well and you know uh my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life you know and they got here but now it's a you know it's so strict that you you can't just do that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right exactly
 		and i think it's important that they you know they allow a good number of people in every year because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that that we don't want to do
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		and i just i don't know i have personally i have a problem with it i think that you know if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that
 	
 	
 		exactly if they're not going to be on welfare or or whatever they're going to be a productive citizen
 	
 	
 		we shouldn't close our door
 		yeah
 		and you know i i believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when you you know send them back to their country
 	
 	
 		yeah but
 	
 	
 		and i think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in and
 	
 	
 		well think of how many illegal aliens have have have been uh you know sent back to Mexico just to find their way back
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's that's what i think you know i i have to laugh because like i said i worked with a lot of those and they'd been deported two or three times and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas
 	
 	
 		that's right that's our money
 	
 	
 		or for any other time
 	
 	
 		yes that's true
 	
 	
 		but
 		i think you know i think all in all there's a lot of improvements i think the general idea is good but
 		but there could be some work done in the area
 	
 	
 		i i think i agree i agree
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway do you have anything else in the the subject uh that you might want to talk about
 	
 	
 		uh boy this is spur of the moment um uh but i i don't really see any any uh changes that i think are really blatant right now other than i think they ought to take you know on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a um
 		political refugee
 	
 	
 		yeah absolutely i think a lot of times we take
 		you know basically who we want to because if you if you have connections it's a lot easier to get in
 	
 	
 		exactly connections and money
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think you know it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that it should be equal to all and then not like the United States basically it's not who you know it doesn't it doesn't become a thing of who you know but but how the type of person you are
 		and it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people like probably your husband can get in
 	
 	
 		i agree
 		yeah well we got him past that but uh  there's i know there's a lot of other people out there
 	
 	
 		well great
 		
 
 	
 	
 		would probably do a good job here
 	
 	
 		yep well
 		let's see is there anything i believe in
 	
 	
 		i think that's it is this like a very short call
 	
 	
 		no i'm not sure how long they're supposed to be but
 		i've enjoyed it it's good hearing your your point of view and i think that's neat i think we agree a lot on that and
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		i've learned something from it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		well thanks i'm glad you're home you have a good evening all right
 	
 	
 		you too
 	
 	
 		thanks bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
