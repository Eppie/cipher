 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what kind of car uh are you thinking of buying next
 	
 	
 		uh more than likely it's going to be a Chrysler
 	
 	
 		you like the Chrysler products do you
 	
 	
 		uh Chrysler LeBaron yeah it it won't be a Ford i've got a Ford Mustang now and i hate it
 	
 	
 		do you really what year is it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's a eighty eight
 	
 	
 		and why don't you like the Mustang
 	
 	
 		it's um i've had one problem with it after the other the the the paint the paint's peeling off of it and there's no reason for it you know and
 	
 	
 		i'll be darned
 		well you know the old sayings about Fords what they stand for
 	
 	
 		fix or repair daily or find on read road dead
 	
 	
 		there you go
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that uh i it's it's my electrical system shorted out like two or three times and it's been torn up since April and i and
 	
 	
 		well uh
 	
 	
 		luckily everything was under warranty so it's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed it would have been like two thousand
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well we've always uh we've always had Oldsmobiles and uh been very uh happy with Oldsmobiles but uh
 		my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those uh Mitsubishi Eclipses
 		she really
 	
 	
 		those those are nice cars
 	
 	
 		she likes uh likes those uh she has a sister that lives in uh Phoenix that has one and uh really uh enjoys it
 		well what uh what things do you consider when you buy a car
 	
 	
 		um the gas mileage for one thing and i've uh
 		i've always had like stick shifts i want this next car i want to get i want it to be automatic
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		because i'm  i'm i hate driving anyway and then
 		and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now
 	
 	
 		yeah well especially when you're in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and you know when you work nine to five or eight to five and you're  in rush hour traffic to and from work unfortunately
 	
 	
 		that makes it very frustrating
 	
 	
 		and i look ah and that one of the things with Chrysler right now is is their the warranties that they have and
 		i've i feel like there's everybody everybody i've talked to that owns one is is is is been real pleased with it hm i like those uh those
 		driver's air bag i like that
 	
 	
 		now this is a LeBaron
 	
 	
 		uh yeah well all Chrysler products has it in there but i is a Chrysler LeBaron would be the next car i get yeah
 	
 	
 		i sure like the uh convertible those ragtop LeBarons they really look sporty
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i like i like that too huh but i couldn't i couldn't afford the insurance on one of those
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh we always  this last Oldsmobile we bought uh it's an eighty seven but we bought it in eighty eight you know right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we found that uh we found a real good interest rate you know when they're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that they really come down on their prices and uh
 		um you know we looked around at used cars and we really couldn't uh afford the payments on a used car because uh if you go to the bank and try to get a loan they want to charge twelve thirteen percent you know
 		and we ended up i think with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car and our payments
 	
 	
 		well that's that's what i'm paying on mine now i i had to get like a first time  my dad's always co-signed on on my my loans or whatever and this is one i've  that whenever i got my Mustang this time
 		was by myself because i was out my own or whatever and um
 		i had said that they they said it had to be like a first time buyer's car or whatever and
 		they're charging me unreasonable about interest but
 		i've got eight more payments and it's paid for
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		but i got it when i got it when the eighty eights first came out
 		so it's it's it's a good car
 		i mean i got in eighty seven i guess in like November or something like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventy seven it was a two door Cutlass Supreme
 		and um it just happened that when we looked for our
 		our new car they had a thing going with Oldsmobile and if you'd buy a a new Oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred dollar rebate because it was their seventy fifth anniversary
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i believe it yeah seventy fifth anniversary so in addition to everything else we got off the car all we had to do is show them our
 		uh papers on our first car and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it so we we got a four door this time and i sort of went more for the uh
 		the comfort factor and uh i like the smaller cars but i'm a bigger person and i i really like comfort you know driving along the road and stuff
 	
 	
 		well that's another big factor of mine next next car i get's gonna be a a four door too something with some room
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		because i  my Mustang's a is is
 		two door with bucket seats and when you buy groceries and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		and if you try to take anybody uh you know go to the show or go out for supper and you go as a foursome
