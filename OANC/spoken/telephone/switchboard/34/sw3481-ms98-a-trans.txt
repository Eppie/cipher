 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		so what did you have done to your car last
 	
 	
 		well just fact just recently we're waiting to get it fixed right now it's uh my wife one day when it was kind of a windy day she opened the door and it kind of blew it all the way back
 		kind of bent it back up against the front bumper there
 		and so we're trying it it uh broke the uh the hinge that holds the door on onto the car
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so it has to be rewelded and everything
 		so uh we're waiting to get that repaired you know repaired and they have to weld it and touch up some of the paint and everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		as for maintenance and stuff that i do i i i kind of don't don't do any my on on my own i other than waxing the car and kleeping it clean but usually i go to like Jiffy Lube and have them do the uh the oil change and the lubrication and such
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really dirty work isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah  how about you
 	
 	
 		oh i'm a single woman so i have most of mine done and i my car died this year  and i went down and priced the new cars and there was no way i could afford a new car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh did it
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i just i went and had mine rebuilt i had a rebuilt engine put in it and the week after that the transmission went out so i had to put a transmission transmission in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but
 		it's running pretty good now after i had all that done
 	
 	
 		gosh what kind is it
 	
 	
 		it's a Lincoln
 	
 	
 		um ours is a uh Voyager Plymouth Voyager
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so and i really like that but that's about it i mean i don't do i used to i used to have a uh when i was single  and i had a a uh Mustang a fast you know an old Mustang sixty five i used to do everything a lot of things you know i'll do all the oil changes and the tune-ups and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know making it fast and putting carburetors and everything like that on it and uh i used to do all that but since since then really no since i got married actually
 		and just find it easier to go to one of these uh you know fast places like Jiffy Lube or someplace like that
 	
 	
 		is it that you don't have the time to work on it like you'd like to or you're just tired of it after doing it for so many years
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's pretty much
 		no it's actually it's more like i don't have the time you know because we also have two kids too and so then i you know i just
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		trying to find time for them and then try to do the car too i just you know and the house and the yard and you know everything else so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so usually i just uh try to make it as convenient as possible and go to one of those kind of places
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well being a single person i can't afford much so i take mine to KMart and get the oil changed on it and i get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i can get by pretty cheap on that and then i have a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		friend that puts my
 		plugs in it when i need new spark plugs and so he does that for me and that's that helps me a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		good deal
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well i guess that's about it huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i need new i'm putting new tires on it now so yeah
 	
 	
 		oh are you
 		oh yeah we did that too in fact that was that was the one right before this is uh we had to get some new tires in the back
 		evidently one of the uh the right
 		rear tire had one of the weights fall off it or something
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and so consequently got a some kind of bubble in what they call out of round or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so you can hear it when you sit in the back you know the thump thump thump thump thump thump and so we had to get a new one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that was a recent one too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and tires aren't cheap
 	
 	
 		well car car that's a car is never ending
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah right
 	
 	
 		you
 	
 	
 		it's always something that's true
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i tell my friend uh when my when i have car troubles he says well you just you have to remember it's just a machine and it's not going to last forever
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i say well i want it to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i want it to last forever i put
 		i put uh two thousand dollars in it and i want it to last
 	
 	
 		yeah you're right
 	
 	
 		at least a little while
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		least another year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yep well that's about all i have for stories on the car
 	
 	
 		yeah me too well what well how old are your kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh one's four and the other one's one
 	
 	
 		oh well they're just little bitty kids
 	
 	
 		yeah so they take up a lot of time
 	
 	
 		really they do when they're little like that
 	
 	
 		uh sure do
 	
 	
 		and are they a boy and a girl or
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
