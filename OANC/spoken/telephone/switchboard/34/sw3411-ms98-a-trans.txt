 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what kind of car would you like to buy next
 	
 	
 		well i guess Cadillac i guess that's kind of everybody's dream
 	
 	
 		huh why would that be a
 	
 	
 		oh i guess it's a General Motors product and i like
 		General Motors because they're made in the United States and uh we've had General Motors for years and have always had real good luck with them
 	
 	
 		okay well that's good if you had uh no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh  um i think i'd still go with a Cadillac i don't i don't care about a big fancy fancy
 	
 	
 		say what
 		which type of Cadillac uh is your favorite
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know i guess the Seville probably or yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		the Seville that's a sharp looking car that really is it it always has been though
 	
 	
 		yeah they have been
 	
 	
 		you know it doesn't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness it never really has it's always had it's own unique look
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i've always liked that i liked the the one year they had or the couple of years they had were uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah right
 	
 	
 		i thought now that looks sharp that looks real sharp
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think the ones uh now with all of the um fancy gold lettering and all you know i think they're very pretty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and course the top now the vinyl what is it a vinyl top i think those are pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh the i i've never really uh i've never ridden in one recently um but they're supposed to be just real smooth
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just a nice comfortable ride
 	
 	
 		yeah they are and uh
 		they they're just always they they look like  they're sturdy you know they look like they're very sturdy and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you don't have to worry that much about  um getting you know hurt like you would in a small one
 	
 	
 		right now they've got a uh a unique feature uh feature in them now if uh if you have a front end accident
 		at such a rate of speed the engine the engine will actually drop
 		out of the car so that it doesn't come through the
 		so it does not go it doesn't go through the you know into the inside it'll go underneath the car instead
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		so that's that's a big safety factor they've got in them now
 	
 	
 		yeah and i suppose they all have the balloons
 	
 	
 		the air bags yep
 	
 	
 		the air bags yeah
 		well
 	
 	
 		so though that's great that's great so you say you've you've always uh preferred General Motors products what uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah i do um i i go for things you know built in the United States rather than foreign countries help our economy and
 	
 	
 		right
 		what kind of uh
 		General Motors cars have you had in the past
 	
 	
 		mostly Oldsmobiles
 	
 	
 		Oldsmobiles those are real nice riding cars too
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah that's what i have now but of course if i had my choice i'd still have the Cadillac but um i've been very satisfied with the with the Oldsmobiles we've driven them for about probably twenty years
 	
 	
 		
 
 		has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra
 	
 	
 		uh no the Ninety Eight
 	
 	
 		the Ninety Eight okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		so
 	
 	
 		well i don't think uh
 		let's see the Ninety Eight now that's got that big V eight engine in it doesn't it doesn't it
 	
 	
 		well no now the one we have has a six uh-huh but it's a very good car it's uh
 	
 	
 		has a little V six
 		okay
 	
 	
 		a have not had one minute's problem with it and i've had and i have twenty three thousand miles on it
 	
 	
 		it
 		oh that's great that's great that's always nice to get uh reliability
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in a product especially when you're spending you know anywhere from fifteen to twenty five thousand dollars for for a single item
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know you just don't want any hassles with it you just you expect it to do its its job and i think a lot of
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into consideration don't take that into consideration you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum there that's true
 	
 	
 		they just expect you to buy their product but
 		that's always been something that's been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car gonna be you know price is is an issue but it's not the most important issue
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no it really isn't because now you can get like five year financing on them and so um but i i i would go with the General Motors any time
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh well i've always been a Ford man myself
 	
 	
 		oh really oh
 	
 	
 		yes but that's all right you know it's it's American made too which is good um but i i've ever since i guess i was i was growing up my dad's always had Fords
 	
 	
 		yeah well sure
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh well i grew up in South Dakota so everybody has a truck
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh my Ford trucks have just i've i've just never had problems with them i honestly think i would die before my truck would kill over on me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah well uh Ford yeah those are good products also um
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		doesn't seem like
