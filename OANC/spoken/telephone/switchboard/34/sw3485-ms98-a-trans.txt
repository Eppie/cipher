 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay do do do you work outside the home or  you a student
 	
 	
 		i do
 		i'm i'm a student and i work at Nu Skin
 	
 	
 		you're a student oh okay so you have a wardrobe to choose
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you wear more dressy type clothes or casual or
 	
 	
 		um we're allowed to wear we just we just can't wear jeans um every Monday through Friday we just have to wear you know nice slacks or um just something that looks nice and then on Fridays and Saturdays we can wear jeans so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		like jean day
 	
 	
 		oh does your does it change pretty much from does it change from season to season or is it pretty standard
 	
 	
 		um it's pretty standard i mean just more sweaters and stuff of course in the winter but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well it seems like  you know warmer warmer
 		even in the winter you go from your warm car to your warm building so there really isn't that much of a
 		of a difference or in the summer it's it's mostly air-conditioning course  you do wear cooler things but i um don't work outside the home right now i have four little ones and so my
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		my clothing doesn't need to be probably as fancy as yours  but um you know mostly during the day i wear the the casual type things and and i have the sweaters and the in the winter and fall and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and cooler things in the summer but i for my husband he wears pretty standard all year round because it's so climatized his work situation but we just recently done something that we found
 		really helpful with his wardrobe and that is um we send all of his shirts and his slacks to the dry cleaners and we hadn't been doing this previously i was
 		you know washing them and ironing and taking care of them at home and we found that it makes them wear and look so much better to have just everything dry cleaned i don't know whether you
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		and you don't find that gets too expensive or
 	
 	
 		well we uh figure it's pretty much worth the expense  just because um
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		the the dry cleaner comes right to his place of work and picks the articles up and takes them
 		and dry-cleans them and brings them back the next day and then they give
 		the company a fifteen percent discount so it really
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		it really is not that expensive and we figure you know what it saves on wear and tear and then and saving me having to do it and they look so much better when they're dry-cleaned
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		than when i do so that it does it does and that's kind of a
 	
 	
 		that makes it really nice
 	
 	
 		uh just just a you know thing we've recently started that's that we found really helpful
 	
 	
 		uh-huh does he have to wear suits and ties and
 	
 	
 		no he doesn't he he wears if he has an meeting a meeting or an important thing he wears a suit and tie but most of the time it's just dress slacks and and you know white shirt usually and a tie
 	
 	
 		uh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so that now that's interesting do you wear when when on the days that Monday like Monday through Friday do you wear slacks mostly or dresses or
 	
 	
 		um i  i rarely wear dresses
 	
 	
 		do you  you're not a dress person
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it doesn't
 		it doesn't have to be that dressy guys have to wear ties at work but shirts and ties at Nu Skin but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		uh-huh even even during the week they do huh or i mean on weekends do they
 	
 	
 		other than that
 		oh no no no
 	
 	
 		not on the weekend
 	
 	
 		but um the guys seem to get to have to dress up a little more than the girls
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		for some reason we can get away with more
 	
 	
 		oh huh what about like shoe type things do you wear mostly dress shoes or do you wear tennis shoes or what
 	
 	
 		um no we can't wear tennis shoes during the week either so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well i guess you couldn't because you wouldn't have jeans on
 	
 	
 		yeah we can't wear
 		tennis shoes but i it's pretty casual i i found i mean it it would be what i would wear to school anyways most of the time so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		so can you wear right what you wear to school to work you don't have to change
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i well i work in the mornings from six thirty to ten thirty so
 	
 	
 		well that's
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i get up pretty early and then school comes after that so i just don't bother to change for school unless i really want to be casual  but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh oh well that's interesting okay well can you
 	
 	
 		yeah how long have you been doing this TI thing
 	
 	
 		um let's see about two weeks is all
