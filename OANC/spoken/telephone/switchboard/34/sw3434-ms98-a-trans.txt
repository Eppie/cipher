 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay let's see um
 		when i was working i would wear um comfortable
 		casual type clothes nothing real dressy but um  mostly um i do like to wear shirts that are kind of longer and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		not real high high shoes i would say more
 	
 	
 		more flats with low heels
 	
 	
 		more more flat kind of shoes and something that would be comfortable to wear throughout the day nothing that would be too dressy
 	
 	
 		well i work in an office so i wear a lot of suits and but my shoes are lower heels i'm not able to wear high heels
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i wear but right now it's kind it's real casual in this office because we're getting ready for this holiday and and we're wearing pants and sweaters
 	
 	
 		which is nice that's that's
 	
 	
 		a lot of girls wear jeans but i just i don't approve of that in a office
 	
 	
 		um-hum i felt the same way well i work in a private high school and i always felt like i had to dress i dress casually but yet i dress a little bit
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		dressy i dress totally dressy compared to what the kids came in to what the kids looked like you know i had to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well you're an example for the kids then
 	
 	
 		right so i had this and real conservative my taste runs real conservative i like white blouses with little Peter Pan collars and sweaters and cardigans and turtlenecks and just kind of um
 		just very conservative kind of traditional clothes and nothing
 		nothing at all faddish i don't i get suits or dresses that i have that i had several years that i can pull out of my closet and they will still be in style just as they were when i first bought them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's good that's good uh-huh that's the kind to get
 	
 	
 		you know that kind of stuff
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind that's in style for a long time that's the kind i have too
 	
 	
 		yeah and just
 		just um
 	
 	
 		i like a lot of color though too
 	
 	
 		i do too i do too a lot of
 	
 	
 		i like the peaches and the
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i have uh dark hair so i do like to wear the real bright i like bright bright royal blues and bright reds on on on me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's kind of nice especially for the holidays it's fun to dress with all the bright colors
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i have light hair it's a kind of a reddish blonde so i wear the bright blues too and the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but i can't wear red red's just too much
 	
 	
 		no
 		too much for you uh-huh huh okay  um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i like the peaches and the greens and the blues and
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		and um let's see what was the question did we supposed to come
 	
 	
 		the seasons the colors in the seasons there's
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i like the darker colors in the fall the browns and the
 	
 	
 		yes now browns i stay away from browns because i have dark eyes and dark hair so for for me
 	
 	
 		oh okay well see i wear a lot of those i like a lot of brown
 	
 	
 		a lot of those who look pretty shirt um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that that i have a a little three year old that has very blonde hair and i dress her with different colors that i never get to wear like the bright
 		the bright um she looks really pretty in yellow just like a real bright lemon yellow and um certain colors like that and she um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'll put on her and they look real cute  um that's it well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well i like a lot of nice i wear a lot of nice clothes too of course they are expensive it takes money to dress nice now
 	
 	
 		well that's the that's the problem i think it's you know the way you would like to dress and the way you could afford to dress is two different
 	
 	
 		well when you work
 		yeah
 		when you work a lot of your money goes to your clothes because you're trying to look nice like everybody else in the office
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's right  i found that even just working part-time in this uh private school last year um it was it it was
 		an expense just to get started to get the clothes after being home with the kids and like i said it was real important because i was working around teenagers and i like you said had to set an example and i
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		well wouldn't have felt comfortable wearing jeans although some of the teachers did once in a while that i don't i very rarely even just wear jeans at home you know i'm not comfortable in them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well now you could have mixed and matched them did you do that with different skirts and blouses and
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		to make different outfits uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yes that that is a big consideration if i have a a solid navy blue blazer i might you know go ahead and pick up a plaid skirt or something and then maybe a solid whatever to mix and match that
 	
 	
 		yeah you can make
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i sit there and really kind of i really have to take a long time to think about what to to get because like you said you have to
 	
 	
 		can make your wardrobe larger that way by
 	
 	
 		right to make it
 		right and also adding some accessories to different different things i'm not a real um i don't like to wear really big earrings i kind of have a few gold earrings that are my favorites and just little pearls so i'm really kind of boring in a sense conservative
 	
 	
 		well now the the scarves i didn't really go for the scarves did you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no they once in a while i'd i'd try one on and it would seem right and then
 		before i walked walked out the door i'd have it off because it just didn't feel right
 	
 	
 		yeah i just didn't go for the scarves i don't know
 	
 	
 		i didn't um i didn't like that too much either
 	
 	
 		i knew some women that they in fact they still
