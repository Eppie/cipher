 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um do you golf yourself or are you a spectator
 	
 	
 		well no i i try
 	
 	
 		you try
 	
 	
 		my husband and i uh took it up last year last summer so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we try and it it we really enjoy it we're having a having a good time although can be rather frustrating  how about you
 	
 	
 		do you
 		did you take a class or did you just start
 	
 	
 		um we took a golf clinic there was about i don't know twelve fifteen people in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and we took lessons for about seven weeks we went once a week and and that's how we got started
 	
 	
 		oh that
 		oh that probably helped a lot i'm more of a spectator i i have been a couple of times with my husband but i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i'm more of a spectator my relatives have a cabin and it's right on the fifteenth hole of a golf course
 	
 	
 		oh how nice
 	
 	
 		it is and we just love to sit and watch the the people golf it's it's fun  to see them i i enjoy looking at
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		noticing different golf courses and the way they're set out you know the the layout and are some of them harder than others or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		they're
 		do they have so they do they name the golf courses like this is a you know beginning one intermediate or
 	
 	
 		you know i've never really heard of it but they do something called the slope rating
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm not into it that much to really know but i think that has something to do with how easy or how hard the course is
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		um uh my dad has talked about it and i'm just kind of like okay whatever  so i'm not really sure or not but i think that's how they rate the the different courses
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh so now when you go do you take a caddy or do you just go yourself or
 	
 	
 		oh no we go ourselves a lot of time we'll walk just to get in the exercise uh depending on how the weather is if it's too hot or something then we'll then we'll ride but we we just like you know getting outdoors and
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and walking around and playing and
 	
 	
 		spending the time together probably
 	
 	
 		yes and that's something that that's a sport that a husband and wife could do together
 	
 	
 		oh yeah do you
 	
 	
 		so we we you ought to take it up it really is a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		it looks fun and it doesn't look that difficult i mean i'm sure that's what everybody says that hasn't tried it
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know you sit there and watch the pros on TV and it's like oh they make it look so easy and you're going oh i can go out and do that and then you get out there and it's kind of a different story
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh well that's what i i noticed uh the golf course that we watch most the times they have you know the sand traps and the little lakes and there's a a river going through the middle of it and the trees and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think boy i in fact we do find a lot of golf balls  off to the side of the road that have been hit off you know and and that's fun we enjoy walking looking for the golf
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		golf balls now how long does it take to to to play a round of golf
 	
 	
 		usually if you're gonna play eighteen holes it usually takes about four hours
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		a lot of times um you know you've got groups in front of you and sometimes you have to wait and and that kind of thing so it you know it can take take a long time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do you usually play the full eighteen rounds or do you just do the nine or
 	
 	
 		sometimes we do nine it just kind of depends if we decide to go out you know in the afternoon and just want to go and play nine then we'll do that but usually we play eighteen
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh so would you recommend taking a class before you just go out on the course and try and try and start golfing
 	
 	
 		yeah probably so just so that you know you know the courtesy and and get at least the basics down so you feel a little bit confident because i know the first time i went out to play i waited until i took all the lessons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i was i was so embarrassed because i thought oh i'm gonna be holding people up behind me and they're gonna be laughing and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know you just i guess you just get nervous and then after you've been out a few times you just say
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh well  you kind of get used to it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh so do you have your own clubs or do you you each have your own set of clubs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah we each have our own clubs when we took our lessons the instructor provided clubs for us because which was really good
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because you know when you're just starting out you don't know what type of clubs to use you know what's the best for you and so there's no sense in buying a set and then finding out later that you really should be using something else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		no
 		uh-huh well that's my husband he took a class in college and he really enjoyed it and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i've since thought about buying him some clubs but i don't know the first thing about it you know and i wouldn't even know where to begin whether
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well you can go to you know a golf shop or something that's what we did when we went to go look for them and they helped us out a lot
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh to tell you the lengths to get and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the different type of oh well that's interesting huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so that that helps
 	
 	
 		boy i'll say yeah because i like i say i don't even know where to where to start what to do but i guess that's i'm sure there's books and
 		on on golf that you could read too so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so do you have a favorite course that you usually go to or do you
 	
 	
 		well we have we have one that it's not our favorite one but it
