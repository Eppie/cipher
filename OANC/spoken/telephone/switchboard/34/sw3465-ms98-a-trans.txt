 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay um i i guess um
 		you know i really i remember what school was like when i grew up and uh you know back then
 		i believe i really do believe people had more respect for teachers back then
 	
 	
 		well that's what i was thinking the discipline just isn't there anymore like it used to be
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they've lost the teachers have lost control
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree and i don't know  i you know i think some of that stems with the parents but
 	
 	
 		well i think so too
 	
 	
 		i i think some of it also stems from just society in general  because teachers aren't looked looked upon as uh you know like with as much respect as they use the to be
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		because back then you know if you were a teacher people used to think oh you know that you know that's great and nowadays if you're a teacher it's like oh you had nothing else that you could come up with to do so you decided to go into teaching
 	
 	
 		yeah well they didn't used to sue the teachers like they're doing now and that's why why the teachers are in so much trouble
 	
 	
 		you know it's like
 		yeah that too
 		that's true
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		that's really too bad that the teachers don't have have control over the students like they used to
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true yeah my wife's a teacher but she teaches preschool
 	
 	
 		and see the um parents used to back up the teachers too they would sit they would tell the kids now you do what your teacher says
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum that's right
 	
 	
 		and the teacher would let them know if they weren't doing the right thing and the parents would be right there on the kids but
 	
 	
 		that's right and it seems to me like now it's just the opposite
 		in in a in a lot of cases you know the
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		parents are behind their kids now and they believe the things that they say about the teachers so
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		i don't know how they would correct it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and i also don't believe that you know uh you know physical punishment is is really the answer either uh
 	
 	
 		no i don't believe that either
 	
 	
 		uh because you know a lot of kids
 		you know they get that at home you know they don't need it at school either they need some other way of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		of discipline that's you know it's going to uh more or less snap you know snap the child around  and and get them you know just just earn some respect
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know anybody can beat up on anybody else
 	
 	
 		well they should just for the discipline at school they should just uh take away some of their things that they enjoy the most
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i guess it really would i mean doesn't matter what age the the child is you know anywhere from
 		preschool to you know teenagers you know you take away what they what they want and enjoy then they're going to pay attention to you
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		i have a sister that's a first grade teacher she teaches first grade
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she just she thoroughly enjoys the kids she really likes them
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm gonna i'm going back to school i'm gonna start back in January get my teaching certificate i'm gonna teach high school
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ooh you're brave
 	
 	
 		i'm gonna be a home economics teacher
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ah
 		you know i i think maybe it might not be too bad of an idea  you you i don't know if you've seen the movie where the the principal cracks down on the kids and he says okay let me know who all the trouble makers are and they're out of here
 		and i'm wondering how practical that is to apply to you know to all the schools it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i wonder if that would work or not or what kind of alternative they could provide for these you know troubled kids and trouble makers that type of thing
 	
 	
 		well you know the main there's a big really another big problem and that's the drop out problem now all the kids are dropping out and i think it's because the parents don't tell them they can't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		parents don't
 		don't um you know the kids say well i don't want to do that anymore and then the parents say well okay whatever you think and that's what that wasn't that way when i was a kid
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		uh and we'd say why do we have to do that and the parent would say because i told you so  and you do what i say see they found they've
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right
 	
 	
 		they've uh lost whoever's supposed to take charge here
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's getting to the point where you know where well you know it's kind of with both parents having to work it's really hard to uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that has a lot to do with it too uh-huh they can't watch over their kids anymore like they used to
 	
 	
 		uh to have the strength
 		yeah yeah and then when mom and dad do give notice at home then you know they're too tired from working all day long they just assume let them do whatever they want and
 	
 	
 		neat
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		don't bother me i'm tired
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah it's really too bad
 	
 	
 		and that doesn't help either that's true
 	
 	
 		because it depends on what they do in school as how they're going to
 		do their future things in life
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true especially i think at the younger ages uh elementary
 		you know  i i think maybe you know i hate to say you know one teacher teaching a certain grade is is higher priority than another teacher but you know so much of of what they experience in their early years
 	
 	
 		oh that's right they need the basics too in the education they need that reading and writing
 	
 	
 		sets a pattern
 		um-hum um
