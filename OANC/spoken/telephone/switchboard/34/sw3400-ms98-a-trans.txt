 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		all right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay what uh what was your name
 	
 	
 		Patricia and yours is Charley right yeah
 	
 	
 		Patricia okay Charley yeah
 	
 	
 		well i i listen to the radio whenever i can i watch TV TV news at night but i'm really a big reader so i read that paper from front to back but i don't think either of the papers i get here in the Metroplex are that great
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		especially the Star Telegram i get that one it's it's not the highest  quality i don't think and i get the Dallas Morning News and it's kind of fading no not the Morning News i get the Times Herald what do you get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um i read the um Dallas Morning News we we've moved here about six month or no eight months ago
 	
 	
 		i think
 		oh where'd you move from
 	
 	
 		North Carolina
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i tried the Times Herald first and then i tried the tried them both and i ended up back with the Dallas Morning News
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's the better of the papers
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i don't and i pretty well read it uh i kind of i mean i go through the whole paper i don't read every
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Karen would you not roll around here please run on run on from out here
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i don't uh i i pretty well look at it all the way through every day and then i listen to i listen on i have a forty five minute drive so i listen to the news on National Public Radio
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too
 		oh yeah i love that i think that's so good once you've listen to that you can't believe the regular radio news
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and they have a lot of um early breaking stories before before anyone else does so i kind of like that
 	
 	
 		huh it
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i like i like that too
 	
 	
 		yeah and i guess uh i'm getting used to the Dallas Morning News i didn't like it as much as the paper that from where we moved but uh
 	
 	
 		oh i don't think any of our papers in the area are great papers you might have had a really excellent one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know you have to get a local paper or you won't know what's going on that's why i get the Fort Worth one which i didn't do for years before we moved over here but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's the only way i could find out what was going on in my own city of Arlington so i had to subscribe to it finally
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we used to live in Fort Worth and we got that paper that was like a number of years ago and i liked it i of course uh that was probably fifteen years ago
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh
 		yeah well the editorial page is pretty good of course they you know it's all things they get from other places
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i'm not really thrilled with with the paper
 	
 	
 		do you listen to National do you listen you say listen to National Public Radio
 	
 	
 		yeah i listen to that quite a bit when i can
 	
 	
 		yeah i listen to it i guess uh well every day on the way in and every day on the way home
 	
 	
 		yeah you really get a whole story you know the news on television is probably i think the worst source
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because it's like eight minutes of top news out of the whole half hour by the time you take all those you know the ads and the sports and the features and the the cute little talk you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i don't know i guess um i used to watch TV news but i don't hardly ever watch it any more uh
 	
 	
 		uh i'll catch the ten o'clock sometimes or if there's a story that i'm really interested in i'll i'll try to
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll turn it on if there's a how about Nightline do you ever watch any programs like that
 	
 	
 		oh i love Nightline yeah i like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i like that too but it's it's hard sometimes to stay up for me that late
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is if you have to do something early where do you work do you work at TI No you don't work at TI do you
 	
 	
 		no i work for a mechanical contractor um
 	
 	
 		where where where do you have to drive to
 	
 	
 		uh Farmers Branch from Plano so takes about forty five minutes
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you go against all that traffic i guess on LBJ or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well no i go kind of a back way but it still it takes forty five or fifty minutes
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah well my husband drives from here in Arlington to TI on Central  well yeah he listens to a lot of news  but
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's a good drive
 		yeah well do you read any uh do you do read any magazines or anything like that
 	
 	
 		yeah um well just Time as far as news i mean we get a lot of magazines but that that's the only news one that i get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah do you read it pretty regular
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh uh well i didn't like it this week it was just all about California and i don't don't care that much about  uh did you get it this week
 	
 	
 		no i don't we don't take we don't take many magazines occasionally i'll i'll see one somewhere and look at it but um i don't uh seems like it takes too much time or something
 	
 	
 		the whole issue's is oh
 		uh-huh
 		well that's true no we do get Time and um i i read it pretty well you know i especially read the political news uh um i like to keep up with that but um
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like you said i think the best source of all is the Public Radio  and Nightline well Nightline's great especially when something exciting is going on you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then i then i'll really make a point well you know it used to come on at ten thirty which was better but then they put that silly Entertainment Tonight
 	
 	
 		yeah so it comes on at eleven now yeah so i'm still used to North Carolina time it was um oh it was eleven up there i think
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh was it
 	
 	
 		yeah but that's still that's awful late
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know i wish it would come on earlier but obviously the sitcoms make more money or they you know or they wouldn't have it on at eleven  but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh well i guess we've exhausted that subject  well who do you think's going to run for President next year since you're up on all your news
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		guess we've got Bush again but
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i don't know who's going to run on the Democrat side um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		Patrick Buchanan supposedly was thinking of running against Bush or he just announced today
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		i don't know if he's announced or he's thinking about it but it was on the news
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well that's kind of a futile effort probably wouldn't wouldn't you think yeah
 	
 	
 		well i would think but it
 		uh it might scare Bush a little
