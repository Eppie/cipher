 
     		
 	
 		okay go ahead
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i  i live we're gonna compare notes um i uh i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		myself often desire to exercise often believe i should and rarely do
 	
 	
 		don't do it
 		well i tell you i i firmly believe in exercising i think it's a i do it everyday on a regular basis i
 	
 	
 		what what what sort of of regiment do you have
 	
 	
 		well i just got back from biking twelve and a half miles but this time of year you can't get much biking in uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but every morning i use this President's uh council of physical fitness and it really is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh uh it's worth doing and you can do it anywhere i i travel quite a bit in my in my business and you can do it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know wherever you're at and if you do it i i do it every morning after uh usually after breakfast before i take a shower and get you know dressed going you know to go to work
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh now what i do i mean i've done this for you know like fifteen years so you don't start at this kind of regiment you know i so what i'm telling you isn't something you go out and do and because you'll hurt yourself
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh every every uh you know it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because i do it all the time but i uh i do twenty five um
 		uh what where you have your arms above your head and and your body twisters touch you know left and right toe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		then i do uh ten uh right and left uh trunk twisters
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i do uh about sixty uh
 		uh you know bicycle type uh leg thrust type things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i do uh twenty uh leg lifters on each side you know when you're prone laying on the floor
 	
 	
 		yes yes right
 	
 	
 		and then i do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups and uh then i do about uh
 	
 	
 		my goodness you do all of this in fifteen minutes
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah and then uh thirty uh now if you did football like like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you you know prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but that takes about really about maybe about thirteen minutes uh you know in the morning to do it but
 	
 	
 		yeah now what what keeps you doing that i mean i i sometimes start start little much less much more modest efforts  but i  give up i just find them boring and hard to
 	
 	
 		well um
 	
 	
 		find time for it on a given day and
 	
 	
 		years ago i used to uh referee football and uh to stay in condition i did that uh just as a normal basis and uh uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i tell you just by doing it uh well
 		example this summer i i was about fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be so i i increased
 		i do three hundred sit ups a day now but not at that in the morning i do a hundred then and then i do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before i go to bed i lost fifteen pounds
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles and you can you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want but you don't you know within within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical your physical being and uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just you know you're ready to go at a i i i think it's really important
 	
 	
 		well i i i whenever i do it i feel good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean good that i have done good because it's it seems right and good because it has good effects but but it's this maintaining a a regular habit that i just can't seem to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well well that's why Chuck i think uh if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i i like biking and during summer i'll do you know at least seventy five miles a week and when i really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty but you can't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know there's excuses the weather or you don't have time or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you're gonna spend fifteen minutes or a half hour and you get up a half hour earlier
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and once you start getting into that one you just feel good and you look a whole lot better
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes do you do you does your wife participate in any of this or
 	
 	
 		unfortunately not and there's no way i can get her to so it's a like it's something you either just really want to do it or  you can't talk anyone into it if you don't like to exercise you know it isn't going to happen but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		i i sure wish she would she's you know unfortunately overweight and but she's a wonderful woman and you know no sense getting in arguments with her anybody about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah well i uh i uh i keep saying if somebody else would do it with me i  that would be a little bit of peer pressure would help considerably
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		but you seemed to have solved solved that problem without any any external
 	
 	
 		no problem at all and uh if you get one of these mats you know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these ABCs of physical fitness on them
 	
 	
 		help
 		yes
 	
 	
 		my one of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year and uh
 	
 	
 		what what what what's on what's this mat i mean in
 	
 	
 		it it it's just an exercise mat that rolls up so you can put it out you know just in the corner
 	
 	
 		is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip and sleep on it i mean it's that it's that kind of like half inch of foam or something
 	
 	
 		well yeah you can do that
 		but but it doesn't
 		yeah yeah it's a foam thing yeah yeah and it's it's just about six feet long it rolls up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't take it on trips with me i you could but uh i don't mind uh you know if i do like sit ups i'll throw a
 		a towel down or something and you know so you don't have the abrasive
 	
 	
 		yeah
