 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well let's see what have you seen lately
 	
 	
 		well uh City Slickers and
 		Star Trek Five
 	
 	
 		five
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		yeah you only only five
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought i'd better see that one before i go and see six
 	
 	
 		well nah didn't need to
 	
 	
 		no i found that out
 	
 	
 		i just saw the latest one
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 		how is it
 	
 	
 		it was fantastic
 	
 	
 		oh i can't wait
 	
 	
 		yeah it's the the lines in there were just perfect i mean it was classic Trek
 	
 	
 		now does the old Star Trek guys meet the new guys
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		no it's just the old guys still
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it was just a rumor that that would happen this time
 		however the rumor is is that it will happen next happen next time so
 	
 	
 		you know that i read in People or somewhere no it was USA Today
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that they said they weren't gonna do anymore that was it
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah uh
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		except that the rumor is is that they still might but it may not include the entire crew and it will be a next generation meets this generation
 		
 
 	
 	
 		huh i'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the the old guys was
 	
 	
 		so
 		i think it's a hundred years
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		somewhere in that range
 		considering that Spock was on an uh you know couple weeks ago and and that the the very first episode of Next Generation they had McCoy
 	
 	
 		oh that's right
 		is that right he was a doctor still
 	
 	
 		and um-hum yeah well you know he it was like a rear admiral whatever you know and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow Vulcans age a lot better
 	
 	
 		well yeah he didn't look too bad did he
 	
 	
 		huh no huh-uh
 		matter of fact he looks just as about as old and the uh Next Generation as he does in the latest Star Trek  imagine that
 	
 	
 		yes yeah that's amazing
 		uh did they have some pretty good special effects
 	
 	
 		oh excellent excellent special effects
 		but i think the script was you know just incredible compared to the last one
 	
 	
 		yeah Five was the script was bad bad bad  no i don't why
 	
 	
 		well you know why
 		uh William Shatner wrote it
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		and even worse he directed it
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Leonard Leonard it its Nimoy he does a lot better
 	
 	
 		oh yeah he in fact uh he didn't direct this one he produced this one
 		but he directed the one before uh i think Star Trek Four something like that
 	
 	
 		In Search of Spock or no Journey Home i think that
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		are you're a real life Trekkie
 	
 	
 		well i think so
 	
 	
 		i really like them i i wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well i've gone to you know one for real live Trek Convention but
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw James Doohan you know the guy that plays uh Scotty
 	
 	
 		huh did you get to talk to him
 	
 	
 		no  not in a crowd like that huh-uh it was like uh want an autograph wanna stand in line for about four hours   it was a pretty crowded place
 	
 	
 		it was crowded no
 		yeah wow
 		huh they have some good management principals in this New Generation
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i it's it's kind of funny i uh was reading in uh a book
 		uh trying to think i can't quite remember the name of the book but it was it was saying don't do Star Trek management style
 		and they were referring to you know Captain Kirk every time he left the Enterprise everything went to hell
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and and nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship
 	
 	
 		right and he kind of was a cowboy type too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he made all the decisions but uh Jean Luke does more of a a committee type of management
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum yeah um
 		it's definitely a lot better  a lot more realistic really
 	
 	
 		what other movies have you seen
 	
 	
 		uh saw The Addams Family last week
 	
 	
 		oh how was that
 	
 	
 		it was pretty good uh there were a few things different than the old series but on the on the whole it was pretty similar
 		and  a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		lots of little funny spots huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		did they have Thing and
 	
 	
 		oh yes in fact Thing has a big much bigger role than he does in the series
 		i mean you know there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and he runs around a lot
 	
 	
 		how did i've always wondered how he gets around
 	
 	
 		uh you know just finger hopping
 	
 	
 		but he's in a box right
 	
 	
 		no no no in fact it's funny he never did does come in out of a box i don't think and he's just kind of walking around
 	
 	
 		didn't he used to
 	
 	
 		not really he was always in the box before
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well that's yeah that's  okay yeah that's what i was thinking
 	
 	
 		yeah
