 		i'm Jay in Dallas
 	
 	
 		okay um i um find exercise kind of a task i guess i'd say i go to aerobics two days a week but i also have three kids at home so they keep me pretty busy
 	
 	
 		that keeps plenty of exercise for you
 	
 	
 		yes it gives me plenty of exercise but i enjoy um  walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family excuse me   and yourself
 	
 	
 		well i uh i uh have uh i walk and run every um almost every morning i've sort of stopped here with the weather change but uh it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum every morning well my husband swims every day at lunch which he loves doing and
 	
 	
 		oh that would that's fantastic exercise
 	
 	
 		yeah he does it every day like a ritual once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he  um someone invites him to lunch he'll he'll not go but  he goes um every every day and then he
 		runs he's a runner too he runs  three mornings a week he gets up about five and and does his his deal  and some days he doesn't but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run  and um we basically
 	
 	
 		hm
 		right i'd rather get a bicycle but i have an i had an exercise bike in the house but uh didn't seem to use it enough so somebody sold it in a garage sale and so uh but i'd like to get a bike and just do outside do biking outside
 	
 	
 		oh
 		the the the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here and i know um uh we we both of my husband and i both
 		do it to just  keep the pounds off we're getting up in age i guess in uh our late thirties so we need to keep exercising just to be able to um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it keeps going because i'm fifty five and it uh it just gets worse worse you still wanna eat and uh but you just i think you feel better too if you get on some program like that but uh
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 		yeah i go to this aerobics class two mornings a week and i take my three year old with me there's a nursery there and it's kind of another day out for her
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to um have little friends and  um i i enjoy the socialization of it you know getting to see the same women every  morning but um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		there're some parts during that exercise that i think i cannot do another second of this
 	
 	
 		oh i know it it it some of it is so tough and uh uh especially when somebody's um planning one for you and they know what what's good for you i think when we do it ourselves we take the easy way sometime
 	
 	
 		it is
 		that's true that's true  well okay well yes thank you for participating thank you bye
 	
 	
 		so
 		so anyway thank you for calling and well all right bye-bye
