 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right here we go
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		Susan what kind of fishing do you like
 	
 	
 		let's see uh the only kinds i've ever done are just regular you know fishing in the lake or i have actually fished for Brook Trout in Colorado but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i've always wanted to go deep sea fishing but i've never i can't ever get anybody to to go with me
 	
 	
 		yeah you almost need to get several to go it it's so expensive to rent those boats
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i that's i that's what i hear is you know that you it's not too bad if you can put uh like eight people on a boat then it comes down to not being so expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i also found out some more about it and i'm not sure i would enjoy it i don't know that i would really like you know fighting with a fish for
 	
 	
 		for umpteen hours yeah that you know takes a lot of strength for that
 	
 	
 		hours you
 		yeah i i
 	
 	
 		i like the kind where i sit on the bank and watch my bobber and when it goes down i pull a fish in
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's the kind i like
 	
 	
 		in fact that's the most successful i have ever i mean as far as ever ever catching a big fish that's how i caught one with
 	
 	
 		um
 		what did you catch
 	
 	
 		um a a bass it was a well see i can't remember if it weighed three and a half pounds or five
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		five pounds or
 	
 	
 		well that's a big fish
 	
 	
 		i mean it was you know big i mean it was biggest fish i've ever caught in my life you know
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		i was so excited you know i was like screaming my father was running you know he saw the fish go flying through the air and
 	
 	
 		i've never caught one yeah
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that part of it was kind of
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		exciting yeah
 	
 	
 		i was fishing with a little light reight weight rod and we'd been fishing down behind there's a place on the back side of this dam of this little lake that we it's a little private lake that we water ski on a lot and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they have have the water they let water drain off the back side of the dam through just kind of a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's some kind of a little drain shaft or something and and it makes a pool and then it goes on down the little creek that they dammed up to make the lake in the first place and they were there's a little pond kind of a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		pool of water there that is pretty turbulent and it's usually pretty good fishing and mom and dad were fishing in there and something kept eating my minnows you know and i was getting real ticked off because i couldn't you know i wasn't catching anything
 	
 	
 		yeah i know
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i crossed the little road that crosses the stream and went stomping down through the woods and where the creek runs on out there's a big old tree uprooted and laid over lengthwise in the water and i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		thought to myself you know i mean this creek is about five feet across max and i thought you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i bet you at the end of those roots there might be something and so i had my little you know i couldn't cast because the tree's hanging over and brush and everything so i just kind of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		held the bobber in my hand and flipped it out there in in and amongst the tree roots
 		and it kind of went around in a circle and then it kind of went right below the water and then it went around and then it just went whom altogether out of sight altogether so i started reeling you know and it was stripping my line
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		as i started going i realized i had something bigger than than i was equipped for because i had one of these little ultra light you know kind of casting rods and i was like oh man so i was reeling for all i was worth and pulling you know pulling on the line with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um
