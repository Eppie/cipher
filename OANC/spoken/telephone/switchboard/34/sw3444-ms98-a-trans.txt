 
     		
 	
 		i'm kind of ambivalent myself uh oh  we we have that kind of a program at uh at work but uh  i'm not crazy about it myself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think that it can be um a hassle but
 		considering some of the things we picked up um i think it's i think it means as much to get a clean one i think being able to prove that you're clean is is quite beneficial to the employee
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		especially when there's been in an accident of some kind or you know something didn't go right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i know our company requires it before uh employment and then if there's an accident on the job they require it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh right
 	
 	
 		and i does your company do the same
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um they require they require it before
 	
 	
 		on a accident
 	
 	
 		uh employment as as a condition of employment and then uh they have random testing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i don't know about after accidents because industrial accidents i guess are relatively rare at TI
 	
 	
 		well we hope they are at ours too but that's just in our policy and procedures
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um we um i think in a in a way it's a protection for the employee
 	
 	
 		i really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because they can say that uh it definitely wasn't their fault  if they work on it you know hurt on the job
 	
 	
 		i guess you could view it that way  i tend to be more concerned about uh where it'll go from here and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		also i  not convinced that the at least the kind of people that i work with i'm not convinced that that's really uh doing much for the program for the uh drug problem
 	
 	
 		oh well i think uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the sensitiveness of either one of other professions requires complete ability to think properly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think from that viewpoint it's not a bad idea but uh i'm not sure that the random testing i'm not so sure
 		but i think if um  if there's any suspicion that a person is using drugs i think that the employer should be able to do a little bit of testing
 	
 	
 		yeah for cause
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah  for cause
 	
 	
 		for cause i just um i'm not convinced that that wheeling all this machinery in place and testing a lot of um
 		uh
 		people who as far as i can tell
 		uh i i think the yield is very low
 	
 	
 		yeah it is even around here
 	
 	
 		um
 		it's uh a lot of expense i know for
 	
 	
 		oh it is um-hum  it's a lot of trouble too because most of the time especially for TI  they have to do chain of custody
 	
 	
 		companies that aren't doing well
 	
 	
 		and um with even with the money we charge for it it uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it uh it's not a money maker
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		not at all but we we do have in our particular facility we have a special area
 		where uh we do special toxicology work and uh the security involved is tremendous  so it's uh
 		one of those things that i know at least in our area is it provides properly which should be you know kind of comforting to people who have to have it done
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i haven't been uh selected for random testing yet but i'm not looking forward to it
 	
 	
 		well oh well all you have to do is go in and give a specimen then go on your merry way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i understand that yeah  but i'm more  something of a civil libertarian i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah don't have to worry about it
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i think uh i'm just worried about what what they'll do next
 	
 	
 		well yeah there's some of the tests that uh i think uh still we have a right to privacy
 	
 	
 		yeah particularly if there um i'm worried about this business of uh  detecting everything that could be possibly wrong with anybody and then adjusting health insurance accordingly
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah i know when some of the disclaimers came out you know and permissions you had to give on health insurance
 	
 	
 		they're gonna start there's
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh right first i had this young lady read it i said i want you to be sure and read this before you sign it
 		she read it she said i think i'll go call my lawyer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she came back in and she says i don't think i want this and i said i thought didn't think you might but you sign away your rights
 	
 	
 		right
 		i'm afraid they'll start uh picking out people with every possible type of risk factor and trying to exclude them from health coverage
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well they do that to some extent already
 	
 	
 		yeah  so i i'd
 	
 	
 		we went into that
 	
 	
 		right drug testing could uh could be the first step towards that so i hope they do it very very carefully and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		we could
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well uh
 	
 	
 		sensitive to what the to the peoples privacy
 	
 	
 		um-hum we do them um for the people i have a have a program where we can do them for the individual
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which is a little unusual but its done through the auspices
