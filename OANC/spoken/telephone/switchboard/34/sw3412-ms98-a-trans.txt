 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh i guess uh
 		you have any uh favorite foods
 	
 	
 		well i like to eat um i like to bake a lot i'm not a gourmet cook but um  just enjoy a lot of old-fashioned cooking
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i i used we used to get the uh magazine Gourmet and uh
 		stuff like that uh i i did try
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a few of the the recipes in there and
 	
 	
 		well how did those those turn out
 	
 	
 		uh well i made a a um
 		a bread pudding uh
 		fancy style and it came out really good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that sounds good my son takes the Gourmet um or the Bon Appetite
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		a magazine and he has prepared several dishes uh  and they've turned out really well one of those is uh was  i don't even i don't even know what the name of the recipe is to this point but
 		um
 		it was just beef cooked with a a lot of wine and and uh all kinds of spices the rosemary and those kind of things and it turned out really really well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i see yeah i i do a lot of i did i've done some uh you know things like chicken and and stuff in there but i
 		i deviate from it i i never like to follow  sometimes if there's something uh in there that i i don't like i'll substitute it with something else and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so uh i like to experiment
 	
 	
 		well
 		well i do too uh in fact uh lot of times i will just
 		uh decide on a a meat and then just put some things around it add some gravies or or um uh sauces and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the the thing i've found that's bad about that if i don't write it down while i'm being creative
 		and it turns out wonderfully a lot of times the next time i think about it i don't have that recipe in mind i can't exactly remember exactly how i fixed it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i've learned that when i am creative like that that i try and make sure i write that down
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um one of the things that i have had a lot of fun doing is collecting recipes uh well not really a i don't have lots but i have
 		collected a few recipes from restaurants and uh we have um
 		i don't know what part of the country you're from in but i'm in Dallas
 	
 	
 		i'm in the northern area up here in Wisconsin Minnesota
 	
 	
 		okay well i'm in Dallas Texas and um here for years and years we've had a waffle shop
 		downtown it's closed now but they had famous waffles and i happen to have
 		that recipe right in front of me which is really um
 		doesn't look like a heart healthy recipe at all but it's delicious if you're into waffles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh well i i like waffles but i usually go to restaurant and eat them
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		i don't even have a waffle iron
 	
 	
 		well  you need one of those for sure but it has um  like milk and it has half half-and-half in it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh  course real butter and
 	
 	
 		i like all those things that aren't good for you
 	
 	
 		the me too me too and i'm beginning to show it too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i uh i mean we we do use a lot of the the margarines and that but i do miss actual butter
 	
 	
 		um-hum i don't uh use butter unless i do some special things uh usually around the holidays
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i tend to um
 		feel like i can justify use the use of butter during that time uh not only just you know to put into the recipes but to serve on the table too
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i know it's something that my wife picked up was uh we uh made some um butter from uh you just take heavy whipping cream
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you keep churning it until it turns to butter so
 	
 	
 		well i've done that a couple of times not on purpose
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i did that by accident a couple of times one of the things that i think i'm going to try this um
 		uh  this year for Thanksgiving is i um i've talked to a a gentleman who prepares turkeys by deep frying them have you heard of that
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		he deep fries the turkeys whole in a peanut oil
 		and he says that um and i haven't tasted them um but he claims that they are juicy and just very very good
 		um he prepares
 		he can prepare up to a thirty two pound turkey uh with the method that that he uses which is just a big vat with you know lots and lots of the the peanut oil
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i think that i think that's um
