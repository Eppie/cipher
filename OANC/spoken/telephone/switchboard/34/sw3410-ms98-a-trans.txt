 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay what do you feel are everyday occurrences that are invasion of privacy in your opinion
 	
 	
 		well uh i guess uh one that comes to mind is um
 		the way the credit bureaus operate
 	
 	
 		i i agree one hundred percent especially whenever it's like  they keep stuff on your record like for seven years and they don't bother like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i know at one time i was unemployed or something and and they kept they kept it on my record for like seven months even though that i seven years even though that like you know i i um
 		yeah they sent a letter in but they didn't bother to include the letter  for the explanation where i got behind or anything like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we had a problem with them back
 		oh i don't know five or seven years ago where it uh some stuff was on there that was incorrect and it was and it was real hard to
 	
 	
 		and well that too
 	
 	
 		get it  get it fixed  but they um they share that information with a lot of people that
 	
 	
 		well that happened with me i um i had had a a doctor's appointment at at uh
 		University of Chapel Hill Hospital
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there was two William Parrishes and they were charging me for this other person
 		and i went through like six months of you know because they kept billing me and billing me and billing me i was like  you know i'm not this person i'm not seeing  seeing  you why are you charging me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i mean they turned me into the Credit Bureau they even held my taxes
 	
 	
 		oh they did
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it went a long ways and it
 	
 	
 		you mean they held your uh refund
 	
 	
 		over my refund that you you know and it was it was a mess and finally i got it straightened out but it it took me almost a year to get that straightened out and it was for something you know uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		another William Parrish that wasn't paying his bills or either else they wasn't you know charging him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it was really weird
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well
 		let's see um
 	
 	
 		i think the biggest thing i think that are is not just well not for the average person i i think like the media's is is getting a little bit overboard on the invasion of privacy on
 		like different on public figures yeah that  some of the stuff that they're they're like
 	
 	
 		on public figures
 	
 	
 		like the tabloids and stuff are are saying that it's like really like i think Joan Collins i believe is believe right now is having a lawsuit against
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		think it's the National Enquirer for taking pictures of her when she was getting undressed in her bedroom and  published them and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i some things i think should be private i would hate to know if i was getting undressed in the bedroom somebody was taking pictures of me you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		someone someone between the curtain was
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i believe they've got  something now i read in some science magazine or something where they have a
 		infrared camera that can take pictures like with inside your house to see if you have any drugs or anything like that i think that's kind of an invasion of privacy too
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah i guess um another thing comes to mind is some of the
 		quote unquote routine uh traffic stops they do that man they did that around Raleigh all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they set those roadblocks up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah to see if you've been drinking and driving
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and you know and and uh
 		boy they just you know they have no reason to be stopping you and they just uh they stop you and and uh
 		look in your car a little bit you know lean in the windows anyway
 	
 	
 		well i i i had something like that happen to me too um i worked for the Hilton for a while as a banquet waiter and um
 		one night whenever i got off work you know it was like two or three in the morning  it was a big party and you know i pulled out of that little road where you know pull out of the Hilton on the old Wake Forest Road going home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i looked up and it was i seen you know blue lights on and i thought God i just pull on the road it can't be me
 		so you know like i pulled off the road and i pulled you know pulled off the side road and the car followed you know the police car followed you know pulled me over and next thing i know there was eight cop cars and they all got out with guns and everything
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		and it it really scared me really bad
 	
 	
 		and they were just stopping you because you were leaving a a night spot probably
 	
 	
 		well uh they they said that i it was suspicious behavior and i looked at you know the highway patrol and i said how could it be suspicious behavior of me
 		uh waiting to a light was green making a left hand turn in the correct lane what's to make you know and they had they went all through my car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you know while  the highway patrolman pulled me back there or and and i i think they gave me a ticket for driving without my license
 	
 	
 		they did search your car though
 	
 	
 		they did yeah without my permission
 	
 	
 		oh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so i i thought i'd i was really offended by that i thought that was a severe invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think some of the laws that they're trying to pass right now um
 		especially in North Carolina uh i mean we
