 		do you ever watch it
 		well my kids like it they all think it's funny and they all say good grief you're just too  you're too old fashion it's just a spoof but i really dislike what it says about marriage i dislike what it says about raising children

 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		everybody says oh it's it's just supposed to be funny i don't find it funny i find it insult
 	
 	
 		it was just for a kick i know
 		yeah but look at the soap operas
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i don't  i work so i'm not a soap opera person and so i just never watch them
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too i know yeah i'm not a TV person i haven't been a TV person and i really

 		which ones do you like
 	
 	
 		oh just the little funny things we love Full House and
 	
 	
 		i love Full House i think that's probably one of my favorite shows
 	
 	
 		you know i just
 		yeah it's mine too and i just
 		it's nice and wholesome and there aren't very many of those you know so we look forward to that and i love i just love that little bitty girl on there  she's so cute yeah
 	
 	
 		no there aren't
 		she's a sweetie and it's uh it's really neat because they really have watched her grow up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh did you see it a couple weeks ago when they had her fifth birthday that was so precious
 	
 	
 		yes they went through all
 		yeah it was really well done
 	
 	
 		it was and i hadn't realized that she'd been on the show that the show had been on that long that she was so tiny
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and that she was just i remember when it very first came out i remember watching the very first episode
 	
 	
 		oh i don't remember
 	
 	
 		and God they were all so young well you know the girl that plays DJ Cameron that's um Kirk Cameron's sister do you ever watch Growing Pains

 		yeah i just never i never got into it and it might be the time that it's on and i'm not sure when it's on but
 	
 	
 		it used to be on Wednesday well first it was on Tuesdays and then they switched it to Wednesdays and i hated that time frame because i had church choir and now it's on Friday nights
 	
 	
 		um-hum

 		no i've never watched it it's just
 	
 	
 		oh he's so it's such a strange thing have you ever seen it
 	
 	
 		not me
 		Quantum Leap
 	
 	
 		it's he changes he has a little buddy that's sort of like a conscience or something i'm not sure and he goes to a different time
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know a time in the past it's sort of like a back to the future theme and he goes back and he changes things
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that they're not like somebody doesn't die but he  becomes that person i mean he's already been a pregnant woman and had a baby i mean it's it's uh it's a ridiculous
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ooh
 		hm i think i might have trouble with that
 	
 	
 		it's a really uh i have trouble with it it's just a really ridiculous show i just hate it my daughter looks forward to it she likes it
 	
 	
 		but but your daughter likes it
 		that's funny

 		you like what
 		i don't watch it either
 	
 	
 		it's a new one that just came on this year and i like it because it's the fifties back in Brooklyn
 	
 	
 		oh see i would probably like that too i enjoy things like that
 	
 	
 		well being from New York i relate to when the Dodgers were in Brooklyn and i mean back you know and so it's like that time and the kids are little when i was kind of little you know and it was
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's sort of like that so it's a little bit nostalgic for me and the things that my father talks about a lot of them are in the show you know so that kind of thing yeah  so i like that
