 		uh been camping in a camper trailer or or on a uh with a truck and a and a camper um when i was younger
 		i really enjoyed going in the in the the trailer
 		i didn't realize until i was older how much  how much work there was involved for the for the parents of the camping
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um are you have what kind of camping have you participated in
 	
 	
 		uh i'm a boy scout leader so we we go camping every month
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know just you know tent camping of
 		i never really camped in you know in a motor home or a trailer
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's always been in a tent
 	
 	
 		so when you go do you go to to designated camping sites or just up in the mountains or
 	
 	
 		just no no the the the boy scouts have their own you know ranches
 	
 	
 		well no mountains there
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that they own and they've got park rangers that run them
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that you know they've got campsites set up and latrines and water and all for the boys
 	
 	
 		oh so you you don't really have to rough it too bad huh
 	
 	
 		no we we bring our own cooking gear you know the the boys split them up in patrols and they cook their own food and stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh do you do you cook over an open fire or do you have the little camp stoves
 	
 	
 		uh we
 		we usually cook over an open fire we've we've got camp stoves in you know in case it's if wood is too wet or something but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh have you ever done Dutch oven cooking while you're camping
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh yes we
 		we've cooked stews and cobblers and biscuits and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in fact every every time i go i end up having to cook biscuits for breakfast in a Dutch oven so
 	
 	
 		oh  you must be an expert huh  oh
 	
 	
 		well  just a lot of practice
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i've had um
 		we go my family once a year goes up to the in the mountains around here it's to a place called Cup River and
 		and camp out with the family and also a family reunion type thing and my uncle makes uh
 		potatoes and onions in the in the
 		in the Dutch ovens and they are sure good i so i don't know how to cook that way but it's
 	
 	
 		yeah we
 	
 	
 		i've liked the things i've tasted
 	
 	
 		we do that for breakfast sometimes
 	
 	
 		oh do you set up your own you take your own tents you say and
 	
 	
 		uh yeah the the boy scout troop owns enough has enough tents for the boys you know two man tents one for each boy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then a couple leaders have big tents that most of the adults you know sleep together in them
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and sometimes sometimes we rough it we went there's a
 		lake called Lake Texoma on a Texas Oklahoma border
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we took the boys backpacking there that they didn't have any
 		you know facilities or anything and we
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		each we packed in our tents we packed in our own groceries our own water and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		oh wow so you have to
 	
 	
 		and boy
 	
 	
 		take everything you need and
 		do they did you just find a place that you liked and decided to set up camp there or
 	
 	
 		it's it's a it's a state park
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we just you know had to check with the ranger and tell him where we was going we had a map and all
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we had the boys the boys hiked in i guess about five miles
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and we set up camp and you know spent a night and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do the boys like that kind of better or do they like to just go where it's close and the facilities there
 	
 	
 		oh they they seem to like the roughing because they want to go again next month
 	
 	
 		oh  next month in December oh i keep forgetting you're it's not as cold there as it is here  oh well i when i was a fourth year uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no it's
 	
 	
 		girl scout camper we we hiked into a spot and that was um by a lake and it was beautiful and i almost think that's you feel more rewarded when you when you do it that way than when you drive in with uh
 		other stuff it is a lot more work though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it takes a lot more so did you camp when you were growing up or is this something you've just done as a result
 	
 	
 		uh i was in scouts as a kid so you know i've gotten
 		when camp with kids i've gotten used to it and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh my wife was from Mississippi out in the country and she's
 		her family camps they you know they spend they spend a week on a lake fishing and stuff uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in fact a few years ago we
 		on Labor Day weekend we went into the Arbuckle Mountains in Oklahoma
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		took three days we camped at a different site each day
 	
 	
 		oh how nice
 	
 	
 		and that was enjoyable
 	
 	
 		boy that sounds like it sounds like it was a
 		a nice trip
 		huh i yeah i have lots of good memories when we always used to take a week in the summer my family and have lots of good memories of
 		sitting around the campfire and marshmallows and ghost stories
