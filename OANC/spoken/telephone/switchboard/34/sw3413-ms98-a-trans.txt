 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh well i i kind of feel like we pay um
 		um maybe uh little uh too much actually i mean like twenty five thirty percent of our income the average family you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes absolutely
 	
 	
 		and it just seems uh
 		um and yet you have big corporations that that manage uh just because the way the laws are written not to pay anything at all year after year after year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh yeah no i i agree with you there um i've gone to other states where there's no food tax you know some things there aren't taxed at all and i think that that's really nice i think they that's what Texas needed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to do also is to discriminate as to uh which should be taxed and what shouldn't be taxed so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i don't i've never been any place that didn't have it we went from here to North Carolina for a while and and they had a food tax there so i guess i'm just kind of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh see we don't they don't tax food here do they
 	
 	
 		no they do they do uh-huh yeah but i have lived in other states in which they don't uh tax uh food uh clothing items personal things like that
 	
 	
 		they do tax
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um so that was that was really neat but i guess the way that they get around it though is that there's no quote state
 		income tax but then you pay  ten fifteen percent taxes um you know i know they say it's only eight and a quarter or whatever it is but uh but yeah i really think that it's it's way too much
 	
 	
 		no state income tax right
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh whenever you buy an item especially a large purchase item it it's it's something in which you're you're paying and you've always got to add in that about ten percent tax
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh what do you feel about do you feel like um
 		how do you feel about for what we get back in the way of services and things
 	
 	
 		in the last what
 	
 	
 		in in the way of services for for the money that we pay
 	
 	
 		oh in the money that we pay um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well  now for the city of Plano um i really like the the things that they offer here
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		um i and i can't say that for for all of Dallas or all of Texas um but for Plano i do i really think that i get my my money's worth they always seem to be ahead of any other um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		city and in the things such as uh you know separating out your glass and your paper now and and uh having the great big you know gallon drums uh uh keeping Plano beautiful and and i think that they really do a good job at it too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well we participate in a lot of the recreational you know we use the recreational facilities
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		where we came from in North Carolina i mean it was a nice area but we didn't have any the mean the
 		the recreational recreational facilities they have here are just
 		unbelievable so i think that we get a good deal in the way that goes
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum um-hum well and i think you get spoiled and you expect it whenever you go to any place else and it's just not quite up to standard or par and it's just like oh gee whiz you know it makes you really appreciate i think uh you know that your city
 		and uh what it has to offer now as for the state you know i uh uh you know i guess the the highways outside of what metropolitan Dallas and Houston are okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i don't know i haven't i haven't been much i haven't been much outside well yeah i used to travel when i was here and they seem to be okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah and the outside i mean the your state highways i i think you know are are pretty adequate uh adequate but gosh you get into the cities and you might as well forget it um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah now we lived in Houston for a while in the  and in in the city was pretty pretty pretty rough in places
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		right yeah so um i i don't know i'm uh i'm really glad that they didn't go to the um the the state income tax um i'm hoping the lottery is going to uh take care of it uh i know there's a lot of religious issues and et cetera
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um but i i'm hoping that uh in a way people can can see that as a contribution then to the state
 		um i did live in Ohio for a couple of years and i know that's how they kind of got around um you know having to uh taxes or increase in taxes was was by the lottery
 	
 	
 		is that right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and and i know the people are concerned that it's only gonna be the the lower you know income people who are actually going to you know be the the biggest participants in this um
 	
 	
 		yeah so some of those folks probably say you're taxing them anyway then if you're dangling a lottery out there in front of them yeah
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah absolutely absolutely and um i only saw it as being you know really positive and of course it you know was just a fluke if you won
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you know because i really never expected to win and and i never did the big big lottery we're talking about uh but you know every once in a while i'd come up with two or three dollars or something but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i felt good in the sense that i was really putting my money the way i felt it was back into uh the taxes uh and it went actually most of it went to the schools and uh to school reforms things like this so uh yeah i i saw it really as a positive thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah how do you feel about um federal services and things
 	
 	
 		you you know i was yeah
 	
 	
 		what are what are the federal services what what do we i mean i know we got a big army and and you know uh
 		i guess i guess they have matching federal funds for a lot of our state and local projects
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right well because i was looking at some of the services that i actually use now i did um uh way back when i did use government um things such as uh uh
 		food stamp
