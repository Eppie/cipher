 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what kind of car would you uh  would you buy if you were going to by one these days
 	
 	
 		uh that uh to be real honest i'm thinking about a truck as opposed to a car
 	
 	
 		what kind of truck
 	
 	
 		um uh uh probably some sort of utility type vehicle either a um my  my particular favorite right at the moment is that Explorer the Ford um Explorer
 	
 	
 		oh i i think that's pretty good i uh i got to look for something too i i unfortunately i have a Ford Thunderbird that uh
 		it's been in the shop for three days and they can't fix the thing so i'm not real happy with Ford at the moment right i think i will try some other  line
 	
 	
 		oh
 		some other brand or something yeah no i just am i have looked for a long time i've i've had since i've been out of school i've mostly had uh you know German cars like um
 		i had i mean you know used ones obviously  um i had a Mercedes sedan and then i had a BMW
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how how did those work
 		how long did they last you they
 	
 	
 		well they're excellent cars and if you uh my uh i was a little partial to the Mercedes i think i almost wish i'd kept it it was old it was by the time i sold it it was about fifteen thirteen or fifteen years old
 	
 	
 		how many miles you get on it
 	
 	
 		oh jeez um
 		ah
 	
 	
 		did you get a couple hundred thousand
 	
 	
 		at least i mean the the the year model that i had was one that that um they say that those engines are built to be completely torn down and rebuilt like at least three times
 	
 	
 		really
 		hm
 	
 	
 		that's the amount of metal that they have in them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that Mercedes really i mean the way look at a car is they built you know they build this car you buy this car you can drive this car your whole life
 	
 	
 		maybe that's the kind of car i better buy i drive too many miles i uh i drive about thirty five thousand miles a year
 		and uh American cars i guess just don't do that kind of mileage
 	
 	
 		i think they don't build them to hold up to that for something
 	
 	
 		well well i think the cars do i don't think they have mechanics that can fix them that's the whole problem
 	
 	
 		yeah that's probably and all this computerized stuff is fine and good but you know something goes wrong and and it seems like
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		you know it's like yeah yeah you can't fix anything anymore you have to replace entire parts or something you know you can't you know back in the olden days
 	
 	
 		well they can't fix it they don't they don't have the
 		no
 		yeah
 		where where do you live what city do you live in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i live in Dallas
 	
 	
 		you live in Dallas well you got the same problem with mechanics i think they i i just don't think there's good mechanics around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i mean i don't know i i do a lot of stuff myself because
 		it seems like if you take something to a dealership you know they are even more inclined to not fix something and just like replace the entire part
 	
 	
 		i think you're right
 	
 	
 		and and and they don't seem to really know how to do anything else you know what i call parts changers and and so i get myself a little book and i start fixing a lot of stuff myself
 	
 	
 		want to fix my Thunderbird  they can't fix it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		if it's a very new one i wouldn't even begin to you know all this computer stuff just loses me i don't like to look under the engine of the car and not see anything i recognize you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		that's the problem i agree with you used to be you could you could repair and do all those things yourself and there's there's so much pollution i i think the antipollution stuff is what really fouls up a lot of engines
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh there's there's no way you can work on them
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think because the whole system wasn't designed with that in mind in the first place so they just came up with something they could slap on after the fact
 	
 	
 		yep that's right
 	
 	
 		you know i mean if if if you really wanted to i mean you know if we can send people to the moon
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we can sure have engineers that can sit down and design a fairly efficient engine that would also be good for the environment
 	
 	
 		i think they can it's just that
 	
 	
 		but the you know there's no percentages in doing that there's too much i mean they can make too much money doing the doing the other way around or something
 	
 	
 		that's why the electric car has has been made for some time but uh there's too much politics and too much
 		gas and oil people that will prevent that from coming on the market for the time being i'm afraid
 	
 	
 		and i'll tell you you know the thing i worry about is
 		that's strictly short term i mean that you know we know that our oil supply is running out you know and what happens when it does is what i want to know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		then they bring it on board
 	
 	
 		i mean i may not have to worry about it because it happen in my lifetime but i worry about it anyway because i know it's out there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's just
 	
 	
 		well we can always go back to horses
 	
 	
 		well that's you know
 	
 	
 		least you don't have to worry about maintaining them
 	
 	
 		this well this is true you could just like have them out there i don't know in the pasture grazing and there's not much fixing with them either
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know i don't know that i'd want to have to rely on that as my transportation but
 		i don't know i just you know i've been looking at at some things and like i say i've been looking at these Explorers and these other kind of you know Blazers and whatnot and you know they open up the hood and they say
 		you know it
 	
 	
 		you think they last a long time
 	
 	
 		i don't know they but they say they open up the hood they show you all these modern advances they've made and they show
