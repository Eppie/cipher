 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh i haven't uh talked to anybody outside the Metroplex so i didn't even think of saying Arlington Texas this is a real first  are you at work
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		yes i am
 	
 	
 		i i i've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening and i thought well i'm not having any luck i'll try the middle of the afternoon
 	
 	
 		well i'm i'm happy we got through
 	
 	
 		i am too well do you uh have any uh opinion on the subject
 	
 	
 		well i'm i'm especially interested with what what's happening in the Soviet Union uh the the move to um
 		uh the the the the Ukraine's vote to uh basically to secede and set itself up independently
 	
 	
 		democracy
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh is quite a remarkable
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		accomplishment is that is that reported in the Texas papers
 	
 	
 		oh sure well yeah we  we we hear a little of the news  uh God i have heard about that the last couple of days how how big is the Ukraine the area do you know
 	
 	
 		um as an area it's not
 	
 	
 		or a population or anything i'm really uninformed
 	
 	
 		i i'm afraid i don't have the statistics in front of me it said
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's not a tiny area um
 		if i was looking at a US map i would say it was sort of reminds me of of a uh
 		well it's not as big as California proportionately maybe
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but but but it's it's more significant  in the sense of it's a great agricultural region
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i see oh i i didn't really know that i know a lot of their
 		oh their countries that they had overtaken or wanted to be independent or several of them right and uh Estonia what about Estonia are they
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they're they're completely out now
 	
 	
 		right i thought they were
 	
 	
 		yeah the three the three Baltic uh republics got out as quickly as they could
 	
 	
 		but but the Ukraine Ukraine is especially significant because it of the agriculture
 	
 	
 		right it's it's very important for the economics of the whole of the Soviet Union
 	
 	
 		um so they would have a probably really fight to keep it in if they could
 	
 	
 		right right um except they can't fight  it's done done democratically um
 	
 	
 		no they don't
 		and Bush has already given his  opinion on it right didn't i read that
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so now uh not that they may that may matter i don't know anymore  i um fear for the Russians from what i read you know i wonder how they're gonna get through the winter
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		foodwise or any wise sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon or not that that would do any good but i guess people do that when they're desperate
 	
 	
 		that that's true uh
 		hasn't happened here for a while but it um
 	
 	
 		well that's true since the Depression i guess when the veterans went to Washington and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and well you know with war riots of course
 		let's let's hope we don't get to that point  things are not so good in Texas jobwise
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		no i've i've heard they're i hear you have some problems
 	
 	
 		well we do we have lots and lots of uh layoffs here lot of companies folding lot of layoffs and it's pretty scary
 	
 	
 		do you do you do you blame the the government in Washington for this
 	
 	
 		well i don't understand economics that well i don't know i i  i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and so i assume that that has some effect
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or a great effect and i do uh i mean they said during the Reagan Reagan Bush years the rich got richer the poor got poorer the statistics prove that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um  i i guess
 	
 	
 		so i mean you think it's it's you think it's Reagan and Bush have done this or is it just coincidence it was during this period
 	
 	
 		well i really don't know i think maybe they uh  maybe they contributed to it maybe they should pay more attention to these trade  or you know to the more equalization of the trade
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		of course if somebody in in China China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions well i don't know what's gonna happen then
 	
 	
 		oh the Chinese use slave labor too that's that's one of the ways they get away with it
 	
 	
 		right
 		and child labor right well i don't know what do you think has caused our horrible situation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um i don't think there's any one one simple answer to the whole thing i mean it's that's very complicated
 	
 	
 		one thing
 		right well they say too that having a democratic congress
 		and republican President is not good the i mean i've read that is a theory
 	
 	
 		so which one are we gonna throw out
 	
 	
 		well i hate to say it but i i'm tending to go stray back into my original democratic party  i i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		Texas Texas used to be a democratic state didn't it
 	
 	
 		oh i know it used to right well you don't run into too many democrats anymore for a while i kind of deserted the party but
 		now it it's looking better to me
 	
 	
 		i like your governor
 	
 	
 		oh do you oh i'm glad to hear that well i think so too i i just admire her her a lot
 	
 	
 		she's an impressive woman
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i hope i really hope she does well but she's uh
 		know  you know probably more popular out of the state than she is here although she did manage to win but look who she was running against you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well yeah anybody could beat Claytie in Texas
 	
 	
 		he shot himself in the foot so many times oh how did you get on this TI thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i i know some of the people
