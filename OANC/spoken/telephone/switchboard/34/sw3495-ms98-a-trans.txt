 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay what do you feel are some of the main problems
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well i'm in a i'm in an urban area i'm in Dallas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem uh even a more major problem uh in Dallas some of the major problems um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		drugs seems to be related related to quite a bit of the crime we have now there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with uh people trying to get money for drugs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i think that's a national problem though it's not unique
 	
 	
 		it it it's pretty bad here too we've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff and in Durham which is right next to Raleigh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 		well now we're pretty close to the golden triangle aren't you
 	
 	
 		yeah that that Durham Raleigh and Chapel Hill is the triangle
 	
 	
 		right research triangle and all of that and um
 	
 	
 		right
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i'm sure you have a lot of students there uh and a lot of researchers so you you may have a
 		you know perhaps a little better economic climate but in all your cities now it seems like there there's a a crowd that's really effected by this bill
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's really it's and and i've seen in more in Durham than i have in Raleigh or or
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		or Chapel Hill Chapel Hill is kind of a a ritzy
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		city or whatever i mean it's kind of
 		i'm i'm sure there's problems with it but it has a pretty low crime rate compare compared to to Durham has probably got the worst
 		they've had like forty eight murders since the beginning of the year and over half of it's been drug related
 	
 	
 		really
 		hm
 		well here uh i'm not sure how many Dallas has had i've
 		uh Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four i I don't know a a number every week
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh Dallas is having quite a few it seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or or like i say drug related
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values seems like a a lot of people
 		don't hold human life quite as high as
 		perhaps they used to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		i
 	
 	
 		well that and the and the economy's so bad and
 	
 	
 		the economy is lousy
 	
 	
 		and so many people have been laid off and stuff they've done special stories on the news local news here we've had a lot of bank robberies and different lot of break-ins and stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i know like a week or so ago
 		i live in a in a town house which is you know it's a pretty nice neighborhood
 		and this lady was going to work she came home and everything in her house was total gone light fixtures everything and
 		nobody thought any different they just thought she was moving it was a moving man pulled right up to her house broke in and stole everything she owned
 	
 	
 		boy that really that really takes someone who's bold to do that
 	
 	
 		well yeah it's it's it's pretty bad
 	
 	
 		well now do you find that security is very good in in a in a town home
 	
 	
 		um i would say so for the majority in in our in my little section of the neighborhood because
 		there's always somebody at home and we all know one another and and on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving  and different things like that it's i i'm
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that
 	
 	
 		i'm probably the one of the youngest people that live over here most people are are retired or or
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		or you know they're they're in their forties or or whatever so
 		and i'm in my twenties so i i'm i'm out more than they are but they're at home at night so i really don't worry about anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think you hit on one point there is you know each other i'm i'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything uh i am
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		oh about three blocks off a major road and uh a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs
 		i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts and uh i'm over the northeast part of Dallas and it's a in a nice neighborhood the houses here
 		uh before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and course everything's down ten to twenty percent now
 	
 	
 		yeah see that's the same thing here
 	
 	
 		but we have uh one one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and now that the economy is bad they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the uh
 		uh they're not nearly as selective as they used to be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex you start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so uh i'm sure that aggravates it also
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but unemployment now in Dallas or in Texas is up around six point
