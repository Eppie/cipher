 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um
 		what do you consider an invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		um i was just now told that's what the topic was and um i guess invasion of privacy uh
 		to me for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for example
 		and uh i guess recently
 		one of the TV stations here uh
 		ran a series of uh news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers
 	
 	
 		that's very easy
 	
 	
 		and use it and i was quite surprised at that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess i can consider myself fortunate that uh it never happened to me
 		i don't know what i'd really do if it did
 	
 	
 		no i've never
 		i've never had that happen to me either what do you think about for instance like i was in Michael's the other night and charged something and they asked for
 		my home phone even though you know the charge had been approved what do you think of that
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		does it bother you to give it
 	
 	
 		no not really because i'm listed in the phone book if i was the type of individual that uh had an unlisted number i i think i would be hesitant to give it
 	
 	
 		you know that they they now have a uh i believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give
 		your phone number on a charge ticket
 	
 	
 		one of the things that upset me when i lived in California was uh they did a lot of things with your Social Security number
 	
 	
 		security number um-hum
 	
 	
 		as a matter of fact they even went to the point of printing your Social Security number on your driver's license
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number so we had our Social Security numbers imprinted
 		on our checks
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i was really you know unhappy about that situation i think that was an invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		privacy yes yes i can see you know where that was i i don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given you know when i have to cash a check
 		i don't see any need for it when i'm charging something
 		but i neither am i a person that  has the guts to say no i'm not going to give it to you either  you know and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		one of the biggest things i think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of uh mail lists and things like that
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		you know uh recently we uh i purchased some magazines US News
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and Forbes magazine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and every since that day i have been inundated with
 		you know uh subscriptions to this subscriptions to that uh this news letter this investment letter
 		uh even to the point of people calling me at home and prior to me ordering these magazines i never got those kind of calls
 	
 	
 		right right i discovered with uh charge cards um
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		i feel like that i don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list
 		or whether the uh uh credit report bureau sells it
 		but i get catalogs from people i've never even heard of and i know they have to be coming from my charge cards you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		from some some list yeah
 	
 	
 		from from some list you know that knows that i have a say a charge account at at Neiman's or something because then i'll get
 		catalogs that you know are within that range that i would never order from ordinarily and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and i get i get tired of that i because i look at all that junk mail and i think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up  you know all their time to sort and they're not even paying full postage
 	
 	
 		all their time
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you know and if you did away with some of that
 		our postal service might give better service
 	
 	
 		i think the general public would be you know uh tremendously upset if they knew
 		how easy it is for uh
 		let's say the criminal individuals to to get access to people's records um
 		their credit cards driver's licenses checks things like that
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		i don't think anybody really knows what to do about it
 	
 	
 		no no um
 	
 	
 		computers ha caused a lot of this i'm sure
 	
 	
 		well you know let's face it computers can be gotten into very easily if you if you really have the the
 		know with all if you're you know so inclined to uh
 		oh what do i want to say have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that you know and have a basic knowledge they're very easy to get into
 	
 	
 		sure
 		seems as though they are yeah
 	
 	
 		to tap into a system uh-huh you know and uh which is scary i mean you know our lives are on computers
 	
 	
 		unfortunately
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh and i don't know i kind of i resent the the calls of an evening trying to sell me something
 		uh
 	
 	
 		fortunately i haven't uh haven't uh
 		been inundated with that situation yet
 	
 	
 		we are constantly it seems like i don't know why you know either wanting to clean our carpet sell us storm windows
