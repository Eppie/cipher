 
     		
 	
 		um well um guess it's logical to ask do you exercise any
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well unfortunately very little uh much less than what i need to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm about the same way i i do a little bit my my job kind of hinders me from
 		exercising i'm a night operator here at a
 		industry down here and i don't really get out a lot during
 		because of my job to to exercise
 	
 	
 		well i uh am an assistant teacher  and uh in business technology and i've
 		i think the most exercise i've gotten in the last three or four month is just jumping up and down to go answer the kids' questions it keeps me pretty busy but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going and and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know really exercise is so important and i realize that
 	
 	
 		it is
 		um-hum that's that's the way i feel i'm used to being in pretty good shape because when i was in high school i stayed in pretty good shape playing a little basketball and stuff like that but i've gotten now i'm in college and i go to school during the day and work at night
 		i can tell that i've not really done a whole lot
 	
 	
 		when you uh exercise what do you do do you do it at home or a club or
 	
 	
 		well uh i usually i'm i usually play at home we live out in the country so me and my brother'll play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play or a lot of times we're we're up at the church we'll play volleyball
 		stuff like that
 	
 	
 		i got a hold of uh Richard Simmons's tape uh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		what is it uh i can't even think of the name of it right offhand uh
 		with the oldies
 	
 	
 		oh the Sweating to the Oldies
 	
 	
 		Sweating with the to the Oldies yeah and that's not bad
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		that's pretty upbeat so you know i every once in a while i'll put the cassette in and go with it but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		not often enough to have a routine
 	
 	
 		right i'll
 	
 	
 		my little Schnauzer wishes i would get out and walk with her
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		i don't know by the time i get home all i wanna do is just collapse or sit down at my computer and my fingers exercise more than anything now
 	
 	
 		right that's the way i am i just want to sit down and relax too tired to exercise
 	
 	
 		yes uh
 		do you ever ride a bike or anything like that
 	
 	
 		i did i started riding my bike about a couple of months ago and i'd ride about two or three miles a day but but it'd last about a couple of weeks and it got real cold for a little while so i gave it up
 	
 	
 		here about the
 		the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk them
 	
 	
 		walk around
 	
 	
 		because they're enclosed and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter
 	
 	
 		right
 		right i've noticed people doing that down here too i'll be in town or something and people will walk around the mall
 	
 	
 		and it's safe
 	
 	
 		it it is it's fairly safe
 	
 	
 		that's uh you know inside the mall may be not safe going to the parking garage lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah certain parts of it
 	
 	
 		i know a doctor once told me it it a friend of mine uh suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is
 	
 	
 		right
 		right i used to do a lot of swimming we have we have a swimming pool and but it's an old concrete pool we've been having trouble with it the past few years
 		so we haven't got to use it much but i love to swim and water ski and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		the uh swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with
 		and the water takes the resistance
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		right and you don't get the soreness
 		i've i've done some water exercises
 		but our pool is not is not heated so it's
 	
 	
 		right you can't do it year round
 	
 	
 		summertime only
 	
 	
 		right that's the way ours is
 		just in the summertime
 	
 	
 		you don't go out when it's
 		twenty some odd degrees and and go out to the swimming pool
 	
 	
 		no
 		no no it's too cold
 	
 	
 		hot tubs are not not uh not too bad but
 	
 	
 		i could deal with a hot tub those are nice
 	
 	
 		so what part of Mississippi are you from
