 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why
 	
 	
 		well i guess i stand on uh
 		on probably ten for no uh restrictions i uh recently just moved to Texas from uh South Dakota and Nebraska and
 		i guess in terms of gun control i've always uh been raised with the uh idea in the Constitution that uh citizens had a right to bear arms and i realize that probably
 		way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded uh more uh of a national defense uh than anything else but uh
 		on the other hand too uh people then uh needed to use firearms for um survival in terms of uh food and uh i was raised uh
 	
 	
 		yes true
 	
 	
 		you know hunting all the time i lived on the farm and and um you know enjoy hunting and i guess i have uh some problems with uh being restricted to
 		um owning a gun for you know hunting purposes mainly
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um
 		it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control
 		to the point where um eventually we may not be able to have that right any more
 	
 	
 		yeah i can i can understand that i was raised in Oklahoma and course being Oklahoman and Texan uh
 		you know hunting the hunting and everything and i'm used to relatives and my father and my husband having guns and all and i i did
 		used to be all in favor of it but it's all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs
 		yet i think i would vote a one if i thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun no crooks nothing but because i know that's not gonna happen
 		then i have to i'm probably right up there about an eight
 	
 	
 		yeah it uh
 		moving to this area of course it happens everywhere but um
 		i guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns uh in the midwest and then uh moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings and uh
 		there seems like killing for no reason at all and uh
 	
 	
 		well it it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was there's always been a certain amount of crime in your
 		you know your urban areas and i know we lived in Chicago for seven years and of course it was definitely there so when we first moved here it wasn't as bad as this it's you know it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse i don't know whether it's due to the drugs
 		and the uh drug kings that are here and and uh Jamaican drug kings coming in i don't know whether that's it or street gangs i don't know
 		what the answer is i know that it's scary and yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i can't do
 		and that's basically what the gun control would end up being
 	
 	
 		i i think so and and there's always the uh
 		the old uh saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll they'll get one and uh
 		and then uh yeah
 	
 	
 		well it's very true
 		it's not the law-abiding citizen that you know is is dangerous with the gun  it's the ones that are going out and stealing it and i said i think the  only way i would be
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them and i think that would almost have to go with armies too i mean that has to be almost worldwide which we know would never ever happen
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's for sure
 	
 	
 		because even if you said okay you know armed forces could have them
 		some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		and you know uh i suppose um years ago way back when uh
 		when uh
 		they had the Revolutionary War and people decided that they uh were fed up with the government uh
 		if they didn't have a way to uh to fight back  they would have been in big trouble
 	
 	
 		that's  that's very true  very true who knows we maybe want to overthrow the government i know if somebody doesn't do something uh
 	
 	
 		well the way things are going
 	
 	
 		what about uh what do you think of this this uh
 		law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can uh carry the gun or buy you know actually purchase the gun
 	
 	
 		well you know they introduced some gun control back when i was a teenager i believe in terms of uh every gun you had bought had to be licensed i believe
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh you know that didn't bother me uh too much and so i guess it depends um if there are some statistics that show that uh
 		that people uh commit crimes on the spur of the moment
