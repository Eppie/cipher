 		hello
 		how are you
 		did you uh did you get the topic
 	
 	
 		i think they said hobbies didn't they yeah
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh where are you from calling from oh okay i'm in Dallas yeah  oh really
 	
 	
 		Plano
 		are you that's about as far away as i've gotten so far  i had a lady two blocks away last time
 	
 	
 		oh i talked to a guy in Virginia Beach last night
 	
 	
 		oh see that would be fun  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that was interesting okay let's talk about our hobbies you ready okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um i don't have  too many hobbies right now i do do sew a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um i used to sew more than what i do now it's it's takes a lot of patience and i'm running out of that the older i get
 	
 	
 		yeah it does
 	
 	
 		and i used to do a lot of stitchery and uh but that takes a long time too it's just it's very time consuming to do
 		sewing and stitchery and things like that what do you do
 	
 	
 		well i used to sew a lot when my girls were really little and i made a lot of their things but like yourself i find i run out of patience with it too and i like to do craft things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know i was uh make those fabric covered photo albums and i teach a class
 	
 	
 		oh those are nice those are really pretty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and i teach that for the Parks and Rec Department a couple times a year
 	
 	
 		teach what
 	
 	
 		how to do it um-hum and i do that and i do a lot of interior decorating and i can upholster the walls and things like that so that's about my hobby and i don't have time for a whole lot
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		uh-huh
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but um it used to be you did those things to relax but now i don't think there's time to relax  so so there is not very much time for that but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right because the women work now most most of them do and what i did things like that when i wasn't working when uh my kids were little babies and i stayed home with them that's when i did it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i do uh-huh
 		right
 		yes see i did too
 		right that's right
 	
 	
 		but when you work full time then it's very hard
 	
 	
 		yeah it is hard but it does save money to do things that way and um i found that i got pretty good at decorating so that kind of is real helpful but you do have to find the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you probably did it more when your girls were little you did it with them
 	
 	
 		so
 		not really i've just really started to do that i just redecorated my bedroom this past year and then i went on to my daughter's room and they turned out really nice i just bought sheets
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i made the curtains and i upholstered the walls and in her room i even upholstered her furniture the drawers
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		so it really turned out nice yeah so you can do a lot for a pretty little amount of money that way
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so my latest thing is those stiffy bow baskets
 	
 	
 		those what
 	
 	
 		the baskets with the stiffy bows have you seen those
 	
 	
 		i don't know if i have or not
 	
 	
 		um they're they just have uh like pieces of fabric and they put it in uh fabric stiffener and let it dry and then bend it
 		and put it on baskets it's real attractive and i  i haven't done one but i bought the things i need and uh my daughter's mom
 	
 	
 		oh
 		is that for a table center piece the basket
 	
 	
 		uh just to sit around the house like for sewing and magazines and things whatever you want potpourri depends on the size you buy
 	
 	
 		oh i see to put things in uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh friend of mine does them and they're just really pretty and she's supposed to show me exactly how to do it one day when i show her how to do an album so
 		i don't know what day that will be but that's our next project probably after Christmas
 	
 	
 		you know when my parents had their fiftieth wedding anniversary i was working in a little Cloth World shop
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and some old ladies came in and they said they did that they said they covered uh photo albums like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i said well uh why don't you make one for me  and put gold on it because my parents' fiftieth wedding anniversary is coming up and they said okay
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they said how pretty it was the ones were that they made so they brought one in for me and uh  i just i hated it i thought it was awful
 	
 	
 		uh-oh
 	
 	
 		and here i had told them to make it they were from out in the country you know and they'd made an extra trip to town
 	
 	
 		hm
 		you've got to be careful yeah
 	
 	
 		to bring me my photo album and i i i didn't like it at all and i told them i said you know i just don't care for this i don't like the way this is put together and uh i don't like what you used and then
 		and then i felt real bad and i said well i'll take it because i ordered it you know and i it was my fault because i didn't specify what i wanted on it or anything i just kind of left it up to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it it was they were old ladies
