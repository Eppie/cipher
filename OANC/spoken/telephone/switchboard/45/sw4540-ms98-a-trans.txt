 
     		
 	
 		gun control
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i guess i'll go ahead and start off uh i'm from Kansas originally and uh in growing up you know basically
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh we all learned how to uh properly handle guns and have the proper amount of respect for them you know we did the hunter safety training and that kind of thing um and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so you know i i guess i really am not uh in favor of a lot of restrictions on on handguns just because least at least the environment i grew up in uh we're all taught in an early age to to respect them and handle them properly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um unfortunately most i guess most people aren't um and so that presents kind of a a a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um funny you know some restrictions may be necessary but uh
 		you know a total ban or something like that i think is kind of
 	
 	
 		out of the question yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh i went through the same thing i
 		i uh you know we do a lot of hunting out here and stuff and you know rifles and stuff we've never had a problem with handguns sometimes i wonder because
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know what do you do with a handgun i mean you don't you really you can't hunt with it uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean you know you you can know how to treat them or you know how to to use them properly but i just have a hard you know i don't think there ought to be a outright ban but i think there ought to be some more restrictions on handguns rather than rifles
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		just because it's so much easier to conceal a handgun for it's easy for a kid to get to it and and you know hurt himself with a handgun i think more so than even a rifle
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so i yeah i'm along with you there i just i have real hard time with handguns but uh like i say i don't want anybody taking my rifles away from me  but uh
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah uh did did you hunt much out there or in Kansas or
 	
 	
 		in actually you know i have never hunted uh which is the ironic thing uh i've done a lot of target shooting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know to to get some skills but i've never actually hunted
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that that you know really gets into that rights thing i mean there's there's a fine line i guess in everything and gun control is one where
 		you know if you could get some proper training and education it's
 		you know i think you'd you'd find that all the the accidents would definitely go down and i you know i remember taking hunter safety and i was like eleven or twelve years old
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean before my dad would take me out deer hunting at all even you know even though i wasn't hunting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i had to know how to handle a gun and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i i think you're right though i you know a lot of the inner cities and stuff like that they just don't get that kind of training
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i you know i'm a i the only that i hate is uh well along with that training is i when kids have accidents with guns i there's a lot of stuff coming out now that they're going to start holding the parents responsible for not
 		making the gun safe and i think there's a lot to that because kids are just naturally curious and then and you know when they're five and six years old accidents will happen that's why you know they need to be locked up the ammunition kept separate and all kinds of stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 		exactly i mean a gun lock is cheap insurance
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know um
 		so i i i don't see any reason why a parent shouldn't do that
 	
 	
 		well i mean i don't i have a real hard time with even keeping a a loaded weapon in my house uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh definitely i would
 	
 	
 		you know you hear you hear somebody come in your house and you're a lot better off letting them take about whatever they want if they're there to steal something rather than take a chance be the hero and get shot or something i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i just there's nothing more valuable than life itself so
 	
 	
 		right right yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah i i definitely i you know was reading the article on uh
 		well on this Ross Perot you know how he's talking about running for the Presidency and i guess he's a conservative uh you know he's more of a Republican politically but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he's got he had some wild ideas about gun control i guess he's really for he's he's for gun control big time and he was saying how he would go in for some
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah he uh
 	
 	
 		some unwarranted searches and seizures of any guns that aren't registered and that really surprised me i like i say i wouldn't want that to to happen
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly you know i mean the guy seems like like a nice alternative but the problem is that i mean at least for me he's uh economically conservative which is good but uh socially he seems to be pretty liberal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um which is not my bent
 	
 	
 		i yeah i understand he was pro he was he was for uh abortion rights
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh and i was really like i say it really surprised me because most of those guys i mean from that the conservative end they are just i mean gun control one hundred percent the NRA is their best friend and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the best lobbyist so i was kind of surprised to see that but you know i think though on the outside too the NRA sometimes goes overboard you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i was just going to ask what you thought about the  NRA uh
 	
 	
 		you know they're i think they're like any lobbyist you've got extremists on both ends you know and they're saying that there's nothing wrong with these assault rifles and this that and the other you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and handguns are just fine and i just think you know there's some middle ground there to where
 		that they maybe go overboard and do too much they i guess they do have a lot of lobbying power power and you know their big thing is well if you you stop banning one type then it's going to lead to the next and so on and
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah the slippery slope argument
 	
 	
 		yeah and i you know i
