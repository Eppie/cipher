 
     		
 	
 		Joe what do you think the election turnout's gonna be this year do you think it's gonna be typically
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh this this year uh i think it's interesting uh we i mean there's so many candidates still that uh we have well there's uh we have uh
 		uh Clinton and uh uh Brown of course yeah and then uh i don't know if you've heard much about this this other guy the independent Perot
 	
 	
 		Brown
 		oh yes he's from Dallas
 	
 	
 		he may be drawing off some uh Republican votes and uh so it  seem George Bush has completely locked up the republican although i think i don't
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i guess he has but
 	
 	
 		if do you think there's gonna be enough excitement that we'll have more people voting
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know i think that's i think that's hard to say i know uh Clinton and Brown are both trying to go after what whatever the block vote whatever that's supposed to be and uh
 		i don't know i i think it'll be interesting i know a a lot of people have you know are are starting to feel are are more you know with the recession uh recession and everything i think a lot more people are starting to uh become more politically actively i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think i think there will be more why what do you think
 	
 	
 		well i i don't know i i think in terms of uh the national elections the election later this year since Perot is from Dallas and if he gets on the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh ballot i think there we that we will have the larger percentage of voter turnout than usual
 	
 	
 		oh you see if yeah right right
 	
 	
 		but i i think it's pathetic that only half of the people in the country that are eligible tend to vote in the national elections
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i and i think it represents uh malaise due to well my vote doesn't count it doesn't matter anyway it's it's really i think it's more of a problem in the local elections
 	
 	
 		right yeah yeah i agree yeah
 		yeah i yeah i definitely agree with you there i mean it's people i mean that that don't care much about uh uh like federal things or you know things you know
 		uh like the deficit people who don't who don't really care about stuff like that really don't have any clues to what's going on like right under right in their own towns or counties or
 		state or whatever so yeah i agree with you yeah i think people are even you know
 	
 	
 		i it's it's too bad i you have more control over your local politicians
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you you'd think people would be more i don't know because they're more in touch uh they're you know geographically i mean uh geographically hm
 	
 	
 		easier to get a hold of  it's easier they're easier to get a hold of it's not a long distance call for one thing
 	
 	
 		exactly sure yeah and i mean most of them are even you know you'll see them you know you know however many times a year they're actually in your city
 		you know in your neighborhood or whatever but uh yeah i guess yeah it is interesting how that works and people just i don't know they just
 	
 	
 		do you vote
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah yeah i do vote uh i know if i when i first registered uh
 		i guess with the last election uh i was uh in my late teens so i only really registered and voted for the uh who was that then that was uh Dukakis and uh
 		uh yeah Dukakis and Bush i guess it was the last time that was i guess that was the first presidential election i voted in but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		at that time i was really apolitical i mean you know that
 		and like you said about uh local uh government or local uh politics i was just
 		you know not in in touch at all
 	
 	
 		well i i think in your case college students in general pretend not to pay that much attention to the local politics i think they've got enough going on
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's that's that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		that's not a part of your world
 	
 	
 		no no that's true um
 	
 	
 		campus elections are more important i suppose
 	
 	
 		campus campus yeah  yeah yeah that's that's that's another that's another thing too
 	
 	
 		but there there's voter apathy there isn't there
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'd say so sure i i know i've never voted in any of the just uh
 		and why i i don't know i just don't see any i don't uh i don't see any importance at all in my vote in the you know in that in that even that smaller uh
 	
 	
 		isn't
 	
 	
 		uh arena of politics i don't even see uh you know any kind of influence or anything or any you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um but uh federally definitely i i think everybody should be you know uh should definitely be uh
 		uh aware of uh you know the presidential elections they should be you know uh
 	
 	
 		participate a little more but then uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they should they should participate uh you know
 	
 	
 		but also think about this if they're dumb enough to not vote do we really want them to vote
 	
 	
 		um yeah  yeah but but but i i i think it'll be interesting to see you know uh i think the people that vote are the people who um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		jeez now now that's hard to say it's hard to say who votes and and why um
 	
 	
 		some of us i think do it out of habit
 	
 	
 		yeah i i mean
 	
 	
 		that's a good habit to have
 	
 	
 		yeah oh it is it is and uh
