 
     		
 	
 		all right do you have any
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh strong feelings on schools
 	
 	
 		well um i think that uh the majority of the problem with the school system um
 		is similar to the majority of the problem in a lot of other areas in it's a question of economics and the school system is not designed to be successful um
 		by that uh it's not really profitable
 		for good teachers to be in the school systems uh if there are good school teachers good really qualified people as school teachers it's because they're dedicated not because they're rewarded for doing so
 		um
 		the school the public school system uh needs to be viewed i think kind of like
 		the highways and hospitals and everything else it's part of the infrastructure it's something that has to be and has to be you know highly highly maintained in order for the nation itself to be successful and when you um
 		when you neglect part of the infrastructure be it the roads or the schools or whatever then everything kind of follows with that it's just a question of how long before you pay the price
 	
 	
 		i've i've uh
 		heard heard the that proposed before and i'm not uh discounting it completely but
 		the counter argument to that is that uh there are schools around that are uh
 		private schools not necessarily uh parochial schools where the teachers are paid no more than they are in the public schools and they and their track records are much better
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh
 		the uh
 		in in fact
 		these days there's a lot of  uh there a lot of
 		uh Catholic and other parochial schools around that are not staffed by nuns and and i'm not a Catholic so but i was just reading about this and what they were the
 		the argument that i've heard is that uh and i subscribe to some of it by the way
 		that uh
 		our schools are reflecting the same kind of mismanagement that uh lead to the demise of the Soviet Union and that is when you've got an absolute monopoly
 		and uh you can't uh you know it's a one party system so to speak then what you're going to have is gross inefficiencies and nobody cares
 		and reality uh uh is just not a market base system and i know i've been in the Orient for about three years and
 		the public schools are not very good but the all all of the good schools are private schools over there
 		and uh it's not that we're spending i i think that we're spending a lot of money uh relatively speaking on schools
 		but uh
 		as with other things you know it like Detroit Detroit or some of the other problems uh with Detroit it's not the worker it's the uh it's the management
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh management frankly just doesn't have to they don't have to compete these days
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd heard something as a matter of fact uh kind of along those lines with i think it was the New York school system
 		where they suddenly instituted a sort of market system where um basically the kids were allowed to take whatever classes they wanted to and go to whatever school they wanted to and it was up to the schools to attract the kids
 		um and offer stuff the kids wanted and what turned out happening this was like area of the country with the highest drop out rate and all this kind of stuff  and what ended up happening is people didn't just take fun classes or anything like that uh it ended up that
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh the rate of of graduating students went way way up and they ended up taking real courses but it was because they wanted to and because they chose to instead of were being forced to and
 		and the the people were forced to compete and and the good teachers were getting the students and that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah and and well i see that as a as what i consider the biggest problem uh
 		as with
 		with uh oh there there are other problems and number one it would be nice if if teachers got paid uh uh i i hate to see the
 		how shall i say it the garbage the guys that collect garbage and and uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		sanitation engineers
 	
 	
 		yes you know well the sanitation engineers that go out there with uh and  just lift uh
 		i hate to see those guys get paid more than teachers
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and different teachers are uh under a lot more stress
 		and don't get any tips at the end of the day at you know at Christmas time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh uh from that standpoint and frankly the private school systems uh
 		uh including colleges and things like that uh do quite well uh because there is a lot of competition
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if somebody decides that they're going to if their decisions are out of step with reality uh pretty soon people don't stop going there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		or they get a horrible reputation and they get this uh what do they call that uh
