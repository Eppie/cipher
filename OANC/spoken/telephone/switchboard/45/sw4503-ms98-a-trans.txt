 
     		
 	
 		do you have a particular attitude about public education
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay well i have one child that's in public schools now i have three children that went to a private school and then we put them into public school system and i think we did them a big disservice by putting them in public schools
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um i think that they my child now is in public school and we're getting ready to put her into a private school because of it i just don't feel like they're they're getting enough out of it you know for
 	
 	
 		academic
 	
 	
 		yes yes i just don't think that academically they're and the school systems here is supposed to be really good they have i don't know if you're familiar but Texas has uh
 		oil money that finances their school system you know there there's no state taxes paid here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i didn't know
 	
 	
 		so the money from the taxes from the oil go to pay go towards the schools and running of the schools so they're supposed to have a really good program but uh
 		i don't know i just feel like my daughters are in college now and the last three years their life they went to public school and they made straight As and they're really struggling in college now
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh i think that it has a lot to do with it i don't i don't i don't know where where you can fix it  you know what you need
 	
 	
 		well apparently in your state there's more incentive to send your child to public uh to a private school because in New York you pay taxes for public schools and then if you wanna send your child to private school you pay again
 	
 	
 		yes well you do that here too you pay higher uh property taxes for the area that you're living in depending on the schools and the area you're in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh okay i got i got the impression you said the oil money paid for the schools so
 	
 	
 		no it it supplements the schools that for therefore there's no state income tax that goes towards uh the school systems
 	
 	
 		ah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because of that you know because of that but the property taxes that you have on your home depending on what area you are you know like they're higher in certain areas than they are in other areas you know but uh
 	
 	
 		sure
 		right i don't i don't have any experience myself with private schools so i really can't say they're better i did go to public schools
 		and what i'm finding um right now i have two kids and i'm going back to work and i'm substitute teaching in public schools
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and what i see in the high school is i don't know that it's public private i think times have changed
 		i mean i know that i would never not do my homework because lightning would strike me something terrible would happen
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum exactly yeah
 	
 	
 		but nowadays the kids don't do their work and they have the nerve to say to you so what are you gonna do and you're not gonna do anything
 	
 	
 		exactly well there's no disciplinary actions you know that can be done taken against them at all yeah
 	
 	
 		but you
 		yeah i think the most important thing that a public school can do to help the problem is to
 		to maybe go backwards in some ways um i find the teachers trying to be like the kids uh telling their kids i teach art and they'll go yeah that's cool well
 		maybe they should talk like grown-ups and the kids should learn to act like grown-ups instead of the grown-ups trying to act like the kids to get their acceptance i find the teachers are very concerned about being liked
 	
 	
 		being friendly being friends with the kids
 	
 	
 		being being friends with them and you know they don't wanna be so strict they don't wanna be so hard on them and i find that the kids are not turning in quality work because there's nothing to impress upon them that they better
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and you know the kids
 	
 	
 		i think that that's right i think i think a lot of that right there and and i think that that's where you come into the private schools the private schools have more power
 		you know i mean because in public schools these people really don't have any authority to do anything or to really punish these kids in any way i mean they can't even hardly give them detention you know without
 	
 	
 		well maybe they'll make them
 	
 	
 		having to call their parents and have their parents come in and all this kind of stuff i mean it really is a major thing
 	
 	
 		well you know yeah well maybe they'll make them stay home for a day but that's no torture for a kid
 	
 	
 		no really exactly yeah to stay home is like oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah and i know kids if they you know if they're late enough often enough they get a letter home and they get to the mail box before their parents because their parents work so you know it's not a problem and i find that you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um-hum
 		they send oh because they send the report cards and and failing notices and stuff home in the mail
 	
 	
 		um yeah well they they sent me yes that's true it progress reports
 	
 	
 		progress reports well see up in Oklahoma now they do that but here they don't do that they give these progress reports to these kids
 		my son is a senior and he failed a class this last six weeks and i'm like Kevin how could but he didn't even tell me you know and so i called the school i'm like i didn't even know that he had was failing this class and their like but we sent the progress report home with him well you think he's gonna give it to me
 		i mean is he  you think he's he may be failing a class but he's not an idiot
 	
 	
 		oh sure they
 		yeah they never have homework they always did it in school i have a fourteen year old son who is just getting into you know realizing that he can dupe me i think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right i know i
 	
 	
 		but i i think the the public school it's not that the teachers are inferior or that the materials are inferior i think what's going on is that
 		the teachers have to be backed up when the kids don't do what they're supposed to do um the teachers have to have some way to
 	
 	
 		well they have to have parental support the parents have got
 	
 	
 		they need the parental
