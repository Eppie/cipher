 
     		
 	
 		okay i um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to let you know what i feel about drug testing uh i have my qualms about having the government or anyone else for that matter
 		testing randomly everybody across the board for various drugs however i am not against
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		testing those people who are in critical uh jobs for example airline pilots subway drivers you know people who are responsible for other people's safety
 	
 	
 		right
 		for uh for uh uh a larger number than just their own personal safety
 	
 	
 		
 
 		correct i just think that it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh unnecessary and really the medical testing facilities that are available now have been shown to have problems in the past as far as reliability is concerned
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we have had situations here where people were accused of um
 		uh utilizing drugs and uh it turned out they were on some other medication which was giving false positives
 	
 	
 		right
 		right and the same goes with uh you can eat poppy bagels poppy seeds
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they'll come up as a as a positive for drugs as well
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is i you know i'd i'd just heard that uh just recently and i thought that was interesting
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh do you more or less follow on the same lines as i do or
 	
 	
 		yeah i i do i um i have a little problem with somebody testing uh for drugs just in general as an invasion of privacy
 		uh but i do agree with you or regarding people that deal uh with groups of other people that their lives should be they should feel a little more safe and there should be more of a safeguard
 		you know air traffic controllers airline pilots uh anybody that deal with the public in a uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know what uh a fashion  that their lives are in their  in in their hands
 	
 	
 		yeah i i know that they were up here in New York um
 		uh i've noticed what they have been trying to do the governor here isn't thrilled with the idea and we have uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		various government officials here who basically don't feel that is a good idea for along the same lines but they're continuously clashing with the federal government which because of it's antidrug war
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um figures well since we're not really accomplishing much of anything internationally let's make big headlines by going out and being for mandatory drug testing and
 	
 	
 		within the community
 	
 	
 		yeah and and that way we'll we'll nail those nine to five worker users without really solving the problem
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		of trying to really do something and through education and that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah they the federal government seems to be a lot more aggressive about this um
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		than uh anything else it's interesting that you find out with all these little scandals going on now such as in the house with the post office cocaine scandal
 	
 	
 		right yep
 	
 	
 		you know all that um
 	
 	
 		well did you hear about the uh what was happening in the Boston area
 		uh for i guess for about the past five they've been testing babies for AIDS
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but not releasing the information
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		they were just testing to find out how prevalent it is uh in what demographic and segments of the population
 		but they weren't telling anybody if they did it when when the results came up positive or negative they weren't telling anybody
 	
 	
 		hum well their sure they were probably afraid of being sued
 	
 	
 		well i'm sure and also bringing light to the fact that they weren't getting parental permission for it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they were just doing this test
 	
 	
 		yeah it's one of these slippery slope issues where once you start by allowing this kind of randomized drug testing it's the same thing with the lie detectors
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and uh the physiological test  tests that go on um really i think you know we are seeing more and more of privacy taken away
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um courtesy of the federal government as time goes on because of the almighty rights of the employer to know every possible thing about their employees
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and uh at times it's hypocritical as well because those in positions of leadership that want these things certainly don't want them applied to themselves
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly they want to they want to be just above in that regard
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i don't know how much you've had experience as far as in the newspapers coming across people who have gotten into trouble with the drug stuff here in in Rochester Rochester
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		in western New York there hasn't been a terrible lot but we of course hear about the subway drivers in New York City
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		who slammed into someone and of course you know the airline pilots are rumored you know there are already rumors of rampant alcoholism now cocaine usage
 	
 	
 		uh well there's always there's a standard joke about the Northwestern pilots
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah wasn't that that thing in  Minneapolis or something when they were supposedly smashed out of their minds and then flew or they had their light
 	
 	
 		yeah
