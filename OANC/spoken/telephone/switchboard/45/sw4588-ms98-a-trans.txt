 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh what are your thoughts
 	
 	
 		well uh interestingly enough i've been reading in the paper about uh the option that says basically none of the above
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and uh given the choices that's sometimes how i feel i generally support President Bush and i feel like he gets a lot of bad press you know the the economy is really not his fault i don't think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		no no
 	
 	
 		but uh as far as anybody else running i think
 		wow  is this the best we have to offer two hundred fifty million people to choose from and this is what we get
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh yeah i uh uh on Sunday night i was listening uh listening to uh the radio and they had they had speculated that uh there was some rumor that Tsongas was thinking of running again
 	
 	
 		yeah what i heard this morning is that although he has dropped out he's still got a lot of support in New York apparently
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and today today you know it today is the New York primary and they seem to be saying that if he got a good he's still on the ballot in New York and they said if he got a good showing in New York then he would jump back in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that doesn't that seem sort of uh
 		uh
 		it doesn't seem seem like it's useful for him to uh doesn't it seem like a waste of money though for him to come back into the race this late uh what are his chances of winning at this point
 	
 	
 		well  obviously he thought they weren't too good if he if he backed out
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i don't know maybe you know New York is a big primary
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there are a lot of others still to come maybe he feels like if he can carry New York strongly then he could still make it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah what what did you think about the Buchanan this term
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it's hard to say it's nice to get somebody in there i would certainly never vote for him as far as i know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it it's nice to have somebody else bring some issues to the front and at least ask the President some questions and have him have to defend himself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i think in that sense it's good i don't think that uh he's experienced enough to do the job uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		on the other hand maybe he is i mean  the newspaper men tell us all the politics anyway so maybe he can just go ahead and keep doing it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right well it's yeah i i agree with you it does seem that he came in and kind of fluffed the pillows uh you know uh for the campaign for the campaign anyway so we didn't have to hear the same thing again
 	
 	
 		how about you
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh we didn't have to uh  we didn't have to ignore a lot of uh Bush's success because you know he really did a lot in the last term he uh
 		with with the Gulf War and all we could have we could have had our judgement clouded just by his his accomplishments you know i i really do think i am going to vote for him again next term but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh i wanted to know exactly everything that happened you know a lot of times maybe i forget
 	
 	
 		well when you look at it too how much does the Gulf War really count i mean how for example how much has it helped us as as a people
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		i'm sure that we can say it helped the uh enemy rate of Kuwait um and uh sure it shook a people a few people up in Iraq but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		is is that a success or is that just sort of uh part of the job description as far as the President goes
 	
 	
 		right
 		right uh what what i mean is though the strong sense of uh nationalism that occurred you know right after the war uh sort of heroized George Bush you know whether or not it was you know a success for us or whatnot  he tended to come out of the out of the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		experience you know as the great American hero and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah his his popularity was somewhere close to ninety percent at the time
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and it
 	
 	
 		so i i i am i'm glad that uh he can't get into office this time without at least uh addressing a lot of the the home front issues
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh well Todd uh it sounds like uh
 		we may have covered a uh a minuscule portion of politics today
 	
 	
 		a very minuscule portion so what about Libya
 	
 	
 		what about Libya i have no idea what to say about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you you've heard of the goings on there i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah i i don't know uh
 		
 
 		if you know if you'd asked me the same question about uh uh Kuwait you know at this early in the game i don't what i would have said then either i i don't
 		
 
 		uh now of course the last time i listened to anything was on Sunday
 		uh and they had still refused uh the concessions by the Security Council so
 	
 	
 		i thought it was let i have to make sure i get the uh stories right because because there was also yesterday the attract the attacks on the Embassy but now didn't Libya
 	
 	
 		right
