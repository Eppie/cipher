 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh go ahead
 	
 	
 		what are we supposed to discuss again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		AIDS research is something that that i think that whether our country is putting enough money into it and actually i'm concerned that they're not
 	
 	
 		more money less
 	
 	
 		i have a friend who is working with uh who works with uh travel groups and one of the ones that he's worked worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS uh conference in uh California
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and these were from other people from other countries he's a translator
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in talking to the people from France he said you know he says one of the things that really concerns me is your government's not telling you enough about how pervasive and frightening this epidemic is
 		and they're letting the information out slowly about how
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know how big it is which is scary you know it's pretty scary when so many people get it so i guess i'm i'm i'd like to see us spend more i don't know that spending more always gets it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'm i'm ambivalent about it because um
 		uh
 		it uh well it is very frightening and scary i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases
 		and uh i mean whether
 	
 	
 		you mean more money for that means less for cancer or yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yes
 		and uh whether those diseases can you some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research uh didn't uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know but
 		i uh then part of it's lack of education i don't know whether whether you know where our money would be most effectively spent
 	
 	
 		well it i i agree with you there because i know every time that it it something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		money from
 		money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly or do they both get served uh that's a good point
 	
 	
 		and i'm i am concerned a lot about uh
 		i'm concerned about uh
 		two things one is preventing the spread and the other is for uh for uh treating the illness
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm not certain i i again this i'm telling you basically i don't have any opinion but whether or not it would be uh our money would be better spent uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		teaching you know working on the drug problems and the and the sex problems uh rather than trying to cure the people that already have it
 	
 	
 		well and one of the things i'd and i'm with you that i don't know is is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know the dentist whether my dentist or
 	
 	
 		uh that's that's the part that
 		
 
 		that's the part that scares me you know i mean beginning with this is this is just for homosexuals well no it's for homosexuals and gays well no actually it's i mean you know did they know that all along
 	
 	
 		and and i heard something the other day this sounds ridiculous about mosquitoes
 		and you know they've been saying oh no absolutely not can't get it from mosquitoes and uh and now they're saying well maybe in the right conditions yes
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i don't know that's true or not i mean i just heard it in passing but
 		so what does that what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
 	
 	
 		right
 		and how is it really transmitted et cetera which is i think what they also don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean that's i think they they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say you know it was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know they just as soon not approve of anyway but but that isn't how it was in Africa
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		in Africa was the men and women and and had nothing to do with that and it's huge over there so i i you know and it's beginning to other countries that's was his point this was an international conference
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where people are saying well but in my country it's you know like this and does that mean like flus
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i mean i don't know
 		all i'm saying is i think it's scarier than we know uh or maybe they understand but
 	
 	
 		i think maybe more information should be given out about it
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh and then the people that have it it does seem that there are are some drugs that are there that you know they keep holding back if you if i were dying i'm not sure i would care
 	
 	
 		i i give me cyanide i mean is it   uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah right  i'll take anything you know i mean if i'm dying if i know i'm dying you can experiment on me go ahead
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly and why can't you why can't the FDA say you know if if these people knowingly consent to be research monkeys and well let them let them do it
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 		yeah yeah and that's i think what they're saying too
