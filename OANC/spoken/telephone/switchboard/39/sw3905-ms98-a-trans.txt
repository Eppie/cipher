 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		what product did you have returned
 	
 	
 		i had to uh i had to return a
 		that recently i've had to return uh uh a cassette recorder
 		um
 		my feelings about products made in the United States uh recently is they are getting worse
 		uh in fact i am kind of disappointed in American made things uh
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well i'm kind of confused about American made products because Ford and Chevy have Isuzu Mazda engines
 		and they're considered American products
 		so i don't understand if we are supposed to not buy Volvos and Volkswagons and Mazdas because they are foreign
 		or if we are supposed to buy American because they're foreign but they are American cars you know what i am saying
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i just don't understand that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it seems that whenever you do have a product
 		parts of it are both American and overseas that it creates a problem
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		both in uh the product
 		and in the
 		overall warranty or lasting
 	
 	
 		have have you recently bought a car
 	
 	
 		yes i did
 	
 	
 		what what did you buy
 	
 	
 		i bought a Chrysler New Yorker and my daughter bought a Plymouth Sundance
 	
 	
 		they are pretty much a hundred percent American made aren't they
 	
 	
 		no uh i was surprised yes Chrysler has some of their parts built overseas also
 	
 	
 		or you know is that right
 	
 	
 		and i thought that was totally American
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and uh that's why i stayed away from General Motors and find out that the same thing happened to me anyway
 	
 	
 		i am really surprised to hear about uh i i haven't studied cars probably as closely as you have
 		um i was really surprised that you mentioned uh Chrysler no it was GM and Ford that are um using Japanese motors and
 	
 	
 		and engines that's true
 	
 	
 		hum huh
 	
 	
 		it seems that they're quote unquote American made where was your VCR
 	
 	
 		um it
 	
 	
 		what was it and what went wrong with it
 	
 	
 		yeah let me see it was a Lloyd and um it it continually i don't know if i think it is Japanese i think Lloyd is made in Japan and uh it it was eating my tapes
 		and uh
 		i don't know i am totally uh totally confounded about uh
 		uh American made and Japanese and
 		i'm not sure which is the best
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i use the Consumer Digest a lot to decide what i want to buy
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too i don't read it but sometimes i  did you know that Fitzhugh
 		is a Japanese computer company and they deliberately make boards and parts wrong so you will have to buy them
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and it cannot be repaired and that upset me when i found that out
 	
 	
 		huh
 		do you own a computer
 	
 	
 		no i don't but my daughter does and she worked with a computer company that uh serviced them
 		and she is the one that told me about that because uh we were we are thinking about buying a computer we haven't done it yet
 		and uh since she works for this computer computer company i asked her what she thought was best cause if TI was using Macs and IBM clones and this type of thing
 		and uh
 		she was saying that she didn't know which one was the best because of the way they're put together and then she was telling me about this uh
 		uh computer
 		boards just put in X number of uh
 		computers and then they last for eighteen months to no longer than two years and then instead of repairing them you have to buy a whole new board
 	
 	
 		i didn't realize that i work for a CPA firm and we have a lot of computers in our office and uh the computers we use mostly are Dell computers and they are manufactured down in Texas
 	
 	
 		by whom
 	
 	
 		uh Dell Computers Dell Corporation
 	
 	
 		Dell Corporation where do they get their parts from Fitzhugh
 	
 	
 		uh uh
 		uh i i don't know ma'am uh i wouldn't be surprised if most of them aren't Japanese parts but uh we've had the Dell computers for four years now and we we're really happy with them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		are you
 	
 	
 		and we use them every day we use them probably eight hours a day on the average every day so they get a lot of use
 	
 	
 		well maybe you're
 		well you're probably fortunate you've probably got one of the better ones
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		so you work part time with an accountant also
 	
 	
 		i i'm full timing with the accountant's office
 	
 	
 		oh
