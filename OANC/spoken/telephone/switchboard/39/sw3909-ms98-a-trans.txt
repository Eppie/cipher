 		Bridgette this is Maureen
 	
 	
 		hi nice to meet you um do you know what we're supposed to talk about
 	
 	
 		yeah if there's something wrong with the school system
 	
 	
 		yeah so are you ready then okay
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i press one don't i okay i've never done this before so  okay
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you there okay
 	
 	
 		uh-huh okay so what do you think is wrong with the school system
 	
 	
 		well you know i was listening to uh Sixty Minutes i think the other night they had Andy Rooney on there  and one of the comments he was making is that um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know part of the problem is uh parents and um
 		their lack i guess of uh interest in the kids in school and he said do you know basically until we change that
 		uh we're not gonna have the kids uh get any smarter because um you know they're not encouraging their kids to do well in school so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		otherwise we're not gonna ever achieve a good education system unless we really get the parents involved
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree with that but that's  coming from because i'm in college right now and seeing how the school systems are my mom's a teacher that's very hard to do in some areas you know it's like they sent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i know where my mom teaches you know and she teaches in like a lower class
 		part of Plano and where it is is they just send their kids to school and you know they don't care if they do their homework if they don't do their homework whatever
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so she says it's very hard from that aspect i mean she'll call the parents and they you know they're like well you know that's not my responsibility it's yours
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i know she gets real frustrated being a teacher that she feels like you know that the parents aren't willing to do that which is very scary i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		another another thing i think though is uh i know now because i'm getting ready to graduate and friends of mine that are getting teaching degrees are um
 		people that aren't getting a master's are having an easier time uh getting a job because they can get paid less
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and it seems like they're just compromising good qualified educated teachers just for someone they can pay less and they get they don't get paid much now and i think that's really bad
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of a shame that um we don't put emphasis and money where we really should i mean we've never really paid teachers real well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we've never paid um other public servants like the police and such very well it is kind of a shame um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there are some times i think that uh you know the quality of teachers may be improved upon i think what they did a few years ago was kind of a joke about testing the teachers and all
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh i think it was
 	
 	
 		um i think that  i think that they're made some changes you know into um
 		the the kind of courses that should be involved in education curriculum and um trying to improve improve upon them uh somewhat but
 		um they've never really paid you know real well and and you know people have to  pick a an occupation that's gonna support themselves it can't be all sacrifice and no you know salary  you got to live on something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		i think it's hard though because even like the like in high school and stuff you take the standardized tests and stuff and i know people that you know are like dyslexic i mean i know people in college that are like dyslexic
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		that i wonder how they pass through all their school you know all their years of school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and pass through all the tests that they had to pass through and so forth to get to college because they have the hardest time you know  things like that always make me wonder too i mean they make all these tests but are they really proving anything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah true and you know some people are much better test takers than others um
 	
 	
 		yeah that's definitely true
 	
 	
 		some people you know um just really clam up when it comes to a test and they're so nervous about well is there a is this a trick question and instead of being real straight forward and just trying to answer it they
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um give themselves you know worse grade because they were so anxious about it
 	
 	
 		see yeah
 	
 	
 		and then other people you know aren't that upset about it and they test very well so there has to be
 		different ways of of testing sometimes you know because um that isn't always a real good reflection of if the person's learned it or not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i agree i think there's just so many problems now with  just kids you know younger these days and
 		all the problems they have and all the problems like in general in the world like with gangs and stuff just being brought into the school is making it worse i think that's not even helping at all
 	
 	
 		yeah you know uh  i i wouldn't wanna be back in school now i think it uh it's a real challenge and you know um i think maybe the kids need more um
 		i don't know counseling or or psychologists you know psychologist or just you know talking about how to get along in life if they're not getting that so much from home
 	
 	
 		yeah
