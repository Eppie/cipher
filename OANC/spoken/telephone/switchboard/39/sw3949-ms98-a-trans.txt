 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay uh Utah has a a good school system where uh
 		as far as i'm concerned i can't really
 		see the difficulty uh or any problems that we have other than
 		they keep saying the ACT scores were a little low
 		or lower than well we're above above the national average but
 		they're talking in the newspapers all the time that we're not doing as well as other countries in science and math
 		which i think there's been an effort to to increase that so
 		i don't see that there's serious any serious uh problems with our
 		school systems here in Utah
 		uh what about Texas
 	
 	
 		oh i'd say uh we probably have what could could be described as serious problems
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		from uh
 		gun toting kids to uh
 		low grades on the teens test
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well i hate i hate to hear it
 	
 	
 		they got a pretty much of a handful of
 		problems to deal with
 	
 	
 		huh
 		where the students are kind of controlling the the schools then in some areas
 	
 	
 		well i don't know if you could say that but they're uh
 		are having to uh
 		put in
 		metal detectors and
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		security and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's not good uh i'd hate to teach under those situations
 	
 	
 		indeed
 	
 	
 		well well that hasn't got here yet i hope it it doesn't but uh
 		it i know we're we're starting to have a few gangs here
 		associated with the schools
 	
 	
 		yeah that's bad news i tell you they uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but that's where it begins i guess
 	
 	
 		course it always sounds a lot worse than it is i suppose but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but at least uh
 		i i go into the schools quite a bit in my occupation
 		the different high schools in the
 		in the six western states that i
 		i work in
 		and uh
 		generally from what i can see the uh
 		we don't really have that type of problems in any of the states yet
 		but i know talking to my uh counterparts back east that they're
 		they have uh security guards that patrol the hallways and
 		and that's not a good learning situation if you've got to have policemen there to
 		keep kids in class and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it sound like that's it's kind of getting to that point in Texas in at least where you're at
 	
 	
 		yeah they uh
 		i don't know i think they uh
 		they need to uh
 		get back to the basics i think we
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		throwing a lot of money at the problem but it hasn't uh seemed to
 		do what's necessary yet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's true and i i think that uh
 		in in our Utah school systems we
 		we've kind of reversed going from the social classes back to
 		a lot of the academic classes that uh they feel is necessary
 		and i think that is that's a good change to
 		to get back instead of so many uh
 		off the wall classes that have nothing to do with academic education
 		you know education
 	
 	
 		i think learning social interaction is good too but uh i think it has to be a balanced curriculum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yes there does uh you can't uh
 		go from one extreme to the other and
 		there there has to be a balance there's got to be both there but i think it should be a little stronger on the academic uh portion
 		in order to prepare them for the society today with the technology that we have they've
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		they've got to have a good math an english background in order to compete
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think uh American schools in general are uh
 		coming up to where they should be
 	
 	
 		no they're talking about uh in some of the states back here are going two hundred days a year instead of a hundred and eighty i don't know what your school year is there but
 	
 	
 		they're talking about going to year they're actually testing out we just had it on the news tonight about the uh year round school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they go for three months and then take a month off or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we have a a there's a little of that going on here but it's all in the elementary grades it's not in the upper uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in the secondary area
 		but i it's there's some test cases to see uh if the students are able to if they don't lose as much uh
 		they're able to retain more where they're only out for a month instead of three months and they have to go
 	
 	
 		exactly i think that was the uh thing they mentioned too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so it sounds like uh
 		in your area and this area too that they're trying to work on the problem that they see as a problem
 		to correct the some some some of the situations uh
