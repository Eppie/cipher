 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so what do you think
 	
 	
 		i figured you were going to ask me first here i was going to ask you first this is a difficult one i mean unfortunately the first thoughts are sort of negative
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but then when i give myself a chance to think about it a little bit more i recognize the positives as well uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		positives for sure are technology and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um some of the changes that the computer age has brought i think that kids growing up today are just
 		uh very much more facile than i was as a kid in terms of the use of computer technology and you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right that's true i mean i'm twenty six now and i came through high school with about the first generation that had computers in the classroom
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and all that and it certainly has been good for me
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so i see myself
 		you know when i learn a new system a new program or a new computer language that it's much easier for me than for let's say
 		my colleagues who are a lot older but just as intelligent and whatever
 	
 	
 		um-hum and the earlier you learn
 		yes the younger you are probably the easier it is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		some of that i think probably we take for granted you know the changes have happened so rapidly that it's it's easy for us to forget how quickly it has changed
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		i think probably the other thing i that came to mind is is the increased awareness on our part of the the criminal element if i can put it that way you know you don't
 		you don't uh casually let kids play in the street or you know ride their bike to friends if you're in an area where you're at all concerned about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and what do you think that's just a question of becoming more aware or has it become less safe over the years
 	
 	
 		abduction
 		i think it's changed i think that in the last twenty or thirty years there's definitely been an increase in that type of crime
 	
 	
 		yeah i would agree with you
 	
 	
 		and i'm not sure why you know uh certainly a question that we could spend hours on you know whether whether there is a change in
 	
 	
 		um that's right
 	
 	
 		in the way a lot of individuals grow up whether or not there is you know more mental illness or something that causes that sort of
 		thing to go on uh i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i don't know i think a lot of what causes it is just economics
 		naturally
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but you know kidnapping is a strange thing you know what kids today are not nearly as free as i was when i was a kid in terms of just being able to go to the store by myself or riding my bike around the neighborhood or
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		being being informed at a very young age about uh going to a shopping center and what to do if a stranger approaches you i mean i never had a concept of that as a kid so that's certainly changed a lot in the last ten or twenty years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i suppose it has uh
 	
 	
 		anyway what are some positives that you could  you've thought about besides  spending too much time on the criminal element
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right uh it's
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		well let's see i think that the mass communication that we have in the world now is in general a good thing and i think it has its good points and
 		bad points but in general it's pretty positive
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it really does bring us together as a global community doesn't it
 	
 	
 		uh more or less yes i mean it is we have the
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		global village you know like Maclean was saying but it doesn't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't think that it really means that we have a sense of community yet as a world
 	
 	
 		uh that's a good point
 	
 	
 		which
 		which hopefully maybe coming we'll have to see
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		i think that's something that uh is a political influence as well you know probably people feel it on a personal level more than they might
 		um on a on a global level you know just being informed about what other countries and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		other cultures are doing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		in a way that we might not have been informed before but yet politically uh their activities aren't aren't
 		influencing how our leaders direct
 		legislation as as much as they could
 		it's still really focused on our interests you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		well yeah that's definitely right i mean and when we're
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		right well with things like the war in Iraq we were
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		dealing with other people's affairs for our own interests certainly is what i believe
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		McDonald's uh
 		burning up the uh
 		the rain forests in order to have more cattle grazing so that  somehow that's something that's not going to work out in the long term in that kind of a cycle it's going to catch up to us at some point
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what else has changed social changes uh i think that there's probably a greater awareness sensitivity on the part of men and women to to what the other
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um is adjusting to in life
