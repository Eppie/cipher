 
     		
 	
 		and how's your weather been
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well my weather right now is rainy uh this is the most rain i think we've ever seen uh over a twelve month period of time since i moved to to uh to the Texas area
 		um i was uh i've seen  climates both rather arid and and and complete and total uh tropical so i've seen kind of the gamut but this is starting to lean towards the uh the tropical end how about you
 	
 	
 		well this is getting to be uh similar to the reason i moved away from Saint Louis all these gray gloomy rainy days you know
 	
 	
 		oh my uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i've been here for about uh well it's going on five years now and this is definitely the rainiest January February
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh this is this is a neat year you missed the nineteen eighty eighty one uh uh mess
 		the nineteen eighty summer that about roasted everybody and then the eighty one spring that uh where practically every lake in uh North North Texas overflowed
 	
 	
 		well i thought it was bad enough about four years ago when we had the was it three or four years ago when we had the big ice storm
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i mean we
 		oh yes ma'am well that was that was pretty good uh however the one in seventy nine and uh and uh seventy eight and seventy nine uh dwarfed that one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you've been here a while then
 	
 	
 		yes ma'am since uh you know i have been well the firm i am with uh i've been with them them for twenty three years so and they are in the North Texas area
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		yeah i have seen quite a bit of of weather uh patterns of course like i say uh when i was in the service i got to see plenty of um
 		different uh locals as far as wet and dry uh climates and uh
 		uh i was kind of like you i'm i didn't want to go back to Colorado because of the different because of the tremendous weather we had
 	
 	
 		
 
 		gosh i think you're the first person from Colorado i have ever heard that didn't say oh it's wonderful it's so dry here
 	
 	
 		um no no no
 	
 	
 		well this actually isn't far enough south for me
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i would like to get down to oh Tampa some place like that where
 	
 	
 		Tampa Florida
 	
 	
 		at least yes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well let's see my in-laws uh winter in uh the Leesburg area
 	
 	
 		is that down the coast of Florida
 	
 	
 		well it's uh in the Orlando area
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and Tampa Saint Petersburg is not that super far away
 	
 	
 		no i think it's a couple hours drive if i
 	
 	
 		yeah something like that i think we made to from their house to uh Bush Gardens in ninety minutes that day
 	
 	
 		uh you may have been speeding a little bit though
 	
 	
 		no no no no no no no not not at that not down that uh uh tollway they've got
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		they're they're smokies you think our smokies are bad with with uh uh our uh little Mustangs that are hot rods they got them there too oh yeah
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know we uh were uh
 		over run by one in uh  we went down for Christmas and we were cruising cruising along in our little rental car and uh this this this car comes over the hill and  pass me and it was one of those
 		puppies and he was flat moving
 	
 	
 		do they arrest people there uh unlike Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah he's he he pulled one  he pulled one over and was uh steady having a little chat about something other than the weather that's for sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because i mean he didn't look happy when we went by
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i don't know maybe it was uh
 		who knows but anyway this weather here is is certainly evolved from a from a dryer hotter uh nineteen eighty
 		to uh the present the the last summer we had i think we barely what cleared a hundred
 	
 	
 		maybe
 	
 	
 		i think that was stretching it
 	
 	
 		well uh i'll tell you i will definitely take the hot summers
 	
 	
 		oh well believe you me i'm not not advocating cold summers no no no no no no no wrong wrong wrong but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh the summer of nineteen eighty we saw one hundred fifteen and one hundred sixteen and i was running a little heating and air-conditioning business at the time
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 		i'll bet you just did all kinds of business
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		what happened there was that most of our customer everybody's customers uh down here about April start to call call everybody you know call their their local guys
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we go out and tune up the systems
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we are normally expecting some a hundred hundred degree days so we tune for that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we had everybody nice in tune when the hundred and fifteen degree weather hit
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and so what the only thing that got replaced were the weak systems
 		you know that would barely make it at one hundred but when the hundred and fifteen degree days hit well it just couldn't couldn't handle the load and they then they then the compressors blew like popcorn
 	
 	
 		oh i'll bet
 	
 	
 		i mean just this pop pop bang bang
