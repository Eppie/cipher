 		what are going to be the chief considerations
 	
 	
 		one of the main considerations is safety and quietness and um economy what about you
 	
 	
 		uh i'm interested primarily in reliability
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well i have found most of the cars now are pretty reliable um
 		i haven't found any that have left me down yet what are your specific requirements American or foreign
 	
 	
 		well
 		well uh let me give you a little history on that i drove i drove uh GM cars for a long time
 		and in fact i had a a Chevrolet and it ended up costing it was only about five or six years old and i was paying on the average a hundred dollars a month in repair bills on that thing
 		and i just couldn't handle that so i took a deep breath and bought a Toyota
 		and have lived happily ever after since then yes yes i've had two small problems neither one of which left me by the side of the road
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		uh with the Toyota in the last five years and and when i was buying that i was concerned primarily with reliability reliability
 		and but i also wanted a hatchback
 		because you know you you sometimes you have to carry bags of fertilizer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		so
 		well it is a sports car that i got which is my first probably my last one because
 		comfort is not
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		high on the list when you get a sports car
 	
 	
 		do you have a family for comfort or
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		just you
 	
 	
 		just me
 	
 	
 		well i had the same problem whenever i had a General Motors car i had a Chevy and uh
 	
 	
 		just me
 	
 	
 		it was constantly giving me valve problems i had this constant ticking of the valves and uh i switched over to Chrysler
 		Plymouth
 		and i haven't had a lick of problem
 	
 	
 		does your car have an air bag
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it does
 	
 	
 		but just on the driver's side
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i wish they would come out with them everywhere on the passenger side too
 	
 	
 		yeah i suspect they probably will
 		and i think on my next car i'll be concerned i'll i think i will want antilock brakes
 		i've heard good things about them it was the first year it was offered on the Toyota Supra when i bought mine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i was a little nervous about some new technology i mean i'd got to where i had real this real hate relationship with anything that looked like service department at a dealership
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i found out they're pretty good whenever uh especially on weather like we're having today and and uh the roads are so slippery
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the antilock brakes are one of the better ones to have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think i'd i'd like that i don't know i i have a friend who drives an Acura Legend which is very comfortable car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it it makes me more aware of how uncomfortable mine is every time i ride in his car
 	
 	
 		my daughter has a
 		Civic Honda and that's a real comfortable car to sit in yeah which surprised me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh is it
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have a Chrysler now i just bought and uh it's real comfortable
 		and i'm very happy with it but Chrysler has a good warranty that they have to stand behind so i haven't had any
 		worries about that that's one thing i go for in a car is their warranty and uh
 		what does and doesn't come under that warrantee but they have the seven thousand uh seven thousand seventy thousand miles or seven years i believe
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh bumper to bumper and i have no complaints
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		so far with mine
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		so if you had to do it again you'd buy another Chrysler do you think would you
 	
 	
 		i sure would
 		Dodge Plymouth Chrysler something in that line
 	
 	
 		that's
 		yeah that's interesting because i mean i i was hearing a just on on the way home from work the other day i heard something on the news about the trade deficit for December the figures were some some very large number
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i was thinking golly and and you know it's partly my fault i mean not in December but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i really have a problem buying Japanese things and for years i bought American
 		and i don't know i hope by the time this car wears out and i hope that's not for another five or ten years
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i hope that i can get an American one at that time
 	
 	
 		well that's another fallacy because uh so many people say that's a requirement has to be American
 		but uh did you know that my Chrysler has foreign parts in it and so does Chevy and so does Ford
 	
 	
 		oh sure it
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um i often hear people saying well i want to buy American or i like the foreign something and uh
 		they're built right here like the foreign cars are even built over here Datsun has a
