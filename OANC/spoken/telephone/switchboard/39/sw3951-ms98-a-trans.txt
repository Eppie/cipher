 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well are you there
 	
 	
 		yes i'm here
 	
 	
 		okay well i just bought a new car that's why i checked um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh what kind you get
 	
 	
 		it's a Toyota Tercel i love it it's really nice yep
 	
 	
 		how do you like it
 		well that's good
 		my um wife just got a new car a Honda Civic so i think i think it's my turn
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well a CRX not a Civic i don't why i said Civic yeah
 	
 	
 		oh a CRX that's what i was looking at
 	
 	
 		yeah she liked it and it's been pretty good so far she's had it about um six months now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um it's been a really good car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't know i think she when she got one i should get one so i'm looking although slowly right now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah my parents are thinking about getting a Toyota Camry
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		my parents are thinking about getting a Toyota Camry because they're supposed to be i think i think Toyotas are really good cars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah just about everybody i've never had one but everybody i know who has they don't have too many complaints which is can't be said about a lot of cars
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't know i think i want a a Chevy Blazer or a GMC Jimmy truck is what i'm looking for a wagon type of deal
 	
 	
 		yeah those are nice
 	
 	
 		it'd be good i look was i looked at a Toyota 4-Runner actually it's the same type of deal but smaller kind of like the S-10s
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for the Chevys and i don't know i like i like the bigger ones better than the small ones if you're gonna buy a truck you might as well buy the real one instead of a toy truck
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well my brother has a my brother just bought a Mazda a little Mazda truck and he loves it course and he's into the little trucks and all and the stereos
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh that sounds pretty good i used to have a an S-10 a little truck i don't know was it was more like having a car than a truck so i decided this time i'll get a big one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		my dad used to have a big full size GMC and um he just bought a little S-10 and now he hates it he wants a full size again yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		he wants a big one again yeah
 	
 	
 		he's so used to driving a big truck
 	
 	
 		that has a lot of advantages and i'm up here in New Hampshire so up north with the snow and everything it's a a big advantage to us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you from Texas by the way yeah yeah most of the people i talk to on this are from down there i'm one of the few New East Coast people
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm in Dallas
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that sounds pretty good do you shop around pretty much when you were looking for your car or
 	
 	
 		yep
 		i didn't do not much at all i went and looked at a GMC i i went and looked at a little truck because i just i don't need you know much more and um
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i went and looked at it and it was just i couldn't afford it or anything
 		so and i was just looking for a little stripped down
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they just wanted way too much for it so i was kind of looked around and i was going to look at a
 		mainly the trucks but i also looked at a Nissan Sentra
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then i went and i looked at the um Toyota Tercel and i ended up getting it because i really liked it i test drove it and i just love it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		are those um four cylinders do you know or six cylinder four cylinder
 	
 	
 		mine's a four cylinder
 	
 	
 		yeah you get pretty good gas mileage like
 	
 	
 		yeah really good
 	
 	
 		around thirty or more than that even or
 	
 	
 		it's about thirty i think it's thirty two in the city and uh like thirty out on the highway it's really good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's a that's about what my wife's car gets
 		little bit over thirty which is pretty good i can't complain right now i have a Ford Escort which is the terrible car but it gets good gas mileage so i can't complain too much but it's ugly and you know it's not real comfortable or anything but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i bought it used after i graduated from school and it's getting the job done but it's nothing that i really enjoy
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to have a Buick Skylark an eighty one
 	
 	
 		uh my brother used to have one of those
 	
 	
 		really mine was  not a good car  i bought it used and it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then i had a lot of problems with it it just made me so mad that because i had to pretty much go out and get a new car
 	
 	
 		yeah lot of time in the shop
 	
 	
 		yeah most of the time or sitting out front  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i know about that i had a i had a
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		Ford Thunderbird for a while and
 		fixed or repaired daily is the joke about the Ford and it was pretty accurate with that car i swore up and down i never own another Ford as long lived and i ended up anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah  yep
 		yeah
 		yeah my family's pretty much against Fords too
 	
 	
 		oh i don't think i'll ever have another one after this one but so far it hasn't too mean to me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		um do you test drive a lot of cars before you um bought them
 	
 	
 		not really i only i test drove mine the one that i got now and um that's the the only one i went and when i looked at the CRX's uh i just looked at them and they had the lot that i went to the close
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
