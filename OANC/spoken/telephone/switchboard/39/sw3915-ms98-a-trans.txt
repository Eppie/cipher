 		The Cradle will Fall and
 		is that the right who's is that one
 	
 	
 		uh she's the one that writes uh
 		uh they're real good she's been writing for a long time and i was trying to remember she wrote one uh she writes they've always have gone the spy um
 		uh thing with them you know setting in in foreign places or and they're they always have kind of a twist to them
 	
 	
 		i've read i've read a few of hers i was just thinking i i just read a trilogy of Mary Higgins Clark
 	
 	
 		oh yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh that's so that's why i got confused but
 	
 	
 		yeah those are good too
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and then i got uh
 		some of Robert Ludlum's i like those too do you like him
 	
 	
 		i've read all of his
 	
 	
 		yeah i get the Supreme Bourne Supreme the Bourne ones i get them all mixed up

 		and uh
 	
 	
 		uh and did you read Fried Green Tomatoes
 	
 	
 		no is it a good book
 	
 	
 		oh it's wonderful
 	
 	
 		where did you get it
 	
 	
 		well my daughter gave it to me uh quite a while ago to read
 		and uh then uh uh i guess what brought it to mind uh was that uh last time i went to see the movie
 		
 
 		and uh it did not disappoint me and it's it's just so well written of course Fanny Flag wrote it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's uh it's got humor in it and a little bit of suspense suspense
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh uh and you'll cry
 	
 	
 		so well i loved Steel Magnolias i heard it was similar to that
 	
 	
 		well i think i didn't read Steel Magnolias but i think it's probably better than Steel Magnolias were
 		the movie is anyway and Steel Magnolias was tremendous
 	
 	
 		yeah that's one of my favorites
 	
 	
 		but uh this one it just uh sort of has a well my husband enjoyed it i i just kind of mixed you know mixed feelings i didn't know whether he would it might be a woman's movie
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh he just he just raved about the actresses in it that they were so good and everything was real and
 		it was just really good and the reason my daughter gave it to me is because my mother is in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think that uh she was trying to give me something to kind of make me get a message of some kind
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh it was good
 	
 	
 		i might go get it because i i'm reading Newsweek right now and i'm going to be finished in a minute and and Bookstop stays open till eleven
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum well i would highly recommended it and don't get discouraged in the first few chapters
 	
 	
 		oh i i don't do that i read those i read pretty quickly
 	
 	
 		because
 		well you may have to go i do to and i had to go back and reread
 		because you have to get the they're telling two stories at once
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you have to get it straight and get the names straight
 		that's the thing get all the names straight
 	
 	
 		that could be difficult but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh where you you're working with two stories and once you get that down it flows and you can't wait to get to the next part
 		it uh it's one of those that you get caught up in
 	
 	
 		i read uh Prince of Tides i haven't seen that movie yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		i haven't read that book was it good

 		because i don't have i don't have anything to do with them when i finish with them you can't sell them for anything
 	
 	
 		no you can't i'd love to borrow it from you
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right um
