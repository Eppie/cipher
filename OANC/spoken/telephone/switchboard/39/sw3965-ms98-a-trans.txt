 		okay do you uh do any woodworking
 	
 	
 		i do and i really love it um
 	
 	
 		oh um what do you do for a hobby or for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i do it for a hobby
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i have my own equipment and i have a jig saw and a scroll saw and
 		uh in the process of getting a router
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so i like to cut out my wood and then tole paint on the items that i cut out
 		what kind of things do you like to do with wood
 	
 	
 		well i'm not the one that cuts them out my husband cuts them out but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw because the stroll saw is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		is a lot slower
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then um he's got a router but now he wants a plunge router
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but anyhow he cuts them out and then i i took a tole painting class
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to learn how to paint them right you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and what we wanna do is you know make them and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and see and see if we can sell some of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but uh i really like it so far
 	
 	
 		oh that is fun
 	
 	
 		and then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood so i took a pattern off of that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face and then you you make the dress for it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you drill holes around the top of the head and you you stick in uh like rope
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh the twine
 	
 	
 		and tie ribbons around it it looked really cute you know so i've got a couple of those started
 	
 	
 		yeah those are so cute
 		they are really cute
 	
 	
 		yeah and then uh
 		but as far as wood work that's all we've been doing right now
 	
 	
 		oh that is that sounds really fun i love those well they have a really fancy boutique out here in Ogden Utah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i just got back from that today so if you could get your projects into boutiques oh they are wonderful
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you could make a lot of money from those
 	
 	
 		what do you do i wonder how you you just they buy them from you or you just give them to them on consignment or something
 	
 	
 		uh apparently with that boutique um they take oh what was it
 		twenty percent of the sell price you would put your sell price
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and then they would take twenty percent off of that
 	
 	
 		um i see
 	
 	
 		at the counter and so and then at the end of the boutique which usually runs for a week
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		then they give you what you earned
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you have to decide what your price is going to be and then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		up it twenty percent so you can get  what you need out of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so if the customers are willing to pay it then you get a profit
 	
 	
 		yeah these little things are so cute though you know
 	
 	
 		they are i i have seen those those are darling
 	
 	
 		i
