 
     		
 	
 		okay this subject is magazines what do you like and what do you dislike about magazines
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i like them because i can read them at my convenience and i don't like a lot of the ads i get in them especially those stupid cards that fall out of them all the time
 	
 	
 		that's my main complaint on magazines too and i get magazines  some of them are just pictures and advertisements
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh Life magazine is like that i quit subscribing to that it's just uh magazine i mean pictures and um
 		advertisements what is your favorite magazine
 	
 	
 		oh i like the magazines like uh the home remodeling magazines like Home or Decorating and Remodeling things like that because you can see what other people are doing with their houses and maybe you could do it in yours
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum you like to do remodeling in your home
 	
 	
 		yeah we've learned how to do a lot of things on our own
 	
 	
 		for instance what are you doing now anything in particular
 	
 	
 		uh no not right now um i haven't gotten any magazines that have shown me anything lately
 		what other kind of magazines do you like
 	
 	
 		well i like Reader's Digest we get that and my husband subscribes to Scientific American i think he's a frustrated doctor
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because he uh reads constantly we have a person in our area
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		that uh his little girl was diagnosed as as terminal and uh he came across an article about leukemia so he had me fix up the
 		make copies of it and give it to them and tell them that there's hope for her and all this
 	
 	
 		hm how many different kinds of magazines do you subscribe to
 	
 	
 		well right now i i dropped People but we have uh Better Homes and Gardens Scientific American and um
 		uh what's the other one i think it's Ladies' Home Journal or Redbook something like that
 	
 	
 		i used to get People but it cost too much so i had to quit taking it
 	
 	
 		did you enjoy it
 	
 	
 		uh sometimes they'd have good articles but a lot of it was kind of uh
 		a lot of fluff and not a lot of substance and it and it like i said it cost a lot of money because i think they came every week or something like that so it was a lot higher than the monthly magazines
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my husband likes to read sports and fishing magazines all the time that's pretty boring to me
 	
 	
 		
  
 		do you get those as subscriptions
 	
 	
 		oh he gets one to uh fishes hm what's it called Stream Field and Stream that's what he gets
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but that's the only one but he'd get more if he could
 	
 	
 		when my husband was younger he liked Outdoor Life he thought that was a pretty good magazine
 	
 	
 		i don't think i've ever seen that one i don't know if they still do it or not
 	
 	
 		i don't know my
 		it might not be because it's been a while
 	
 	
 		you know what i really hate about magazines is those smelly cards that have perfume or cologne
 	
 	
 		what's that
 		with the scratch and sniffs
 	
 	
 		the well the ones aren't they're not scratch and sniff anymore the the one kind i'm talking about you open it up and
 		the fragrance is just there it's like a fold that's glued shut but usually
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		when you get the magazine the whole magazine  smells like that fragrance and you can't get the smell out and it and sometimes it makes you have a headache because it's so strong
 	
 	
 		what magazines are those i don't know if i've ever seen one in mine or not
 	
 	
 		well they came in People and a lot of times if you buy like the fashion magazines the Cosmopolitan or the Glamour or or Elle those type have have them in
 	
 	
 		oh i don't get those
 	
 	
 		i don't get them on a regular basis but sometimes i've bought them
 	
 	
 		hm
 		do you have any pet uh magazines
 	
 	
 		no we we have two dogs but no magazines come in  uh regarding pets at all
 		
  
 	
 	
 		do you like the Reader's Digest when the in their uh theirs they're kind of interesting they have the uh
 	
 	
 		i like Reader's Digest but i usually borrow my parents' of that because they get it so i didn't have to subscribe
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		so you get away easy huh
 	
 	
 		yeah well a little bit
 		but i like the they're interesting and plus i like to read through the in the anecdotes and the jokes and things on those
 		sometimes the book excerpts are good too but mostly i like the other articles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i like the vocabulary section in that
 	
 	
 		yeah i like that too sometimes you can get a pretty good uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		and sometimes the  real definition is something totally of opposite of what you thought it was
 	
 	
 		yeah doesn't that blow your mind away when that happens
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's something
 		and
 	
 	
 		sometimes i like the true to life stories but sometimes they get too melodramatic
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like what do you mean
 	
 	
 		it seems
