 		God i wish i would get  i always get people from Texas
 	
 	
 		i'm i i i just i never call anybody i just let them call me
 	
 	
 		do you that's probably why i always call because i figure it's easier that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		than trying to catch me at home  well okay are you ready for me to push one okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what kind of exercise do you do or do you do any
 	
 	
 		um i do some not a lot  i'm kind of lazy um
 	
 	
 		well i am a couch potato
 	
 	
 		yeah  i know how that is  i do play like racquetball a lot that's fun
 		i like that the best
 	
 	
 		i've never played racquetball no uh
 	
 	
 		you haven't  well i'm in college and i took it as a class like last semester and i just loved it i thought it was great it's really a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's not real hard now i'm taking like weight training and i hate it it's so dumb
 	
 	
 		i've tried weight training i just i just can't get into it  no it
 	
 	
 		really it seems so pointless
 	
 	
 		and it well i don't like having the sore muscles i like to run jog
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yeah i i used to jog about six miles a day and then i i tore the ligaments in my ankle so i i don't really run that much but i i i jog some about a mile or so now
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when i have time
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i'm not real into like aerobics are anything like that
 		only exercise when i have to i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's basically me
 	
 	
 		you know i'm kind of i'm really bad about it
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm i exercise more in in the summer and spring than i do um like this time of year because
 	
 	
 		yeah when the weather's nicer is it really
 	
 	
 		it it's too cold here  yeah well i i i think forty degrees is too cold so
 	
 	
 		yeah  little cold for you
 		i know that's how i am too because i i love going outside and stuff when it's warmer and stuff but otherwise i won't i mean i won't go work out or i won't jog i won't go outside i'll just stay at home you know on the couch watching TV or renting movies or something
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's basically what i do i like  i like to um
 		to walk too i i guess they said it's a good form of exercise i guess uh if you consider that exercise i walk a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you
 	
 	
 		but i i have such a normal fast pace so it i don't really i don't really think it's
 	
 	
 		it it's
 		it's nothing  or it could be your exercise for the week right
 	
 	
 		right i because i mean i i've always walked fast so i i don't know i need to get on a some kind of exercise program though because i'm i'm starting
 		to gain weight i'm getting at that age where  you don't need to start putting on the pounds
 	
 	
 		oh listen to you uh-huh they'll catch up with you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it it has caught up with me in the past year or so i've i've put on about
 		twelve pounds so i need to work and get it off i thought about doing a diet but i really don't need to diet i i just need to
 	
 	
 		really
 		exercise
 	
 	
 		exercise i think
 	
 	
 		yeah it sort of that does make you feel better though i had to admit that you know after
 	
 	
 		yeah because when i get off work i usually come home and fix dinner and watch TV and then i'm tired i take a nap whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah see after work i don't know  i think if i worked all day there's no way i would do anything
 	
 	
 		oh i work i work eight to five so i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah so then when you're home you're like okay i just want to relax and not think about work and definitely not exercise you want to eat
 	
 	
 		right i i do accounting and and it's on a computer all day and i'm so brain dead when i get off work it's kind of like just don't even talk to me just let me sit here and vegetate so
 	
 	
 		yeah you're probably drained and probably exercising probably wouldn't help
 	
 	
 		well i don't i don't know  i they say once you once you get in a routine of exercising it gives you a lot more energy energy i know when i ran
 		um i kind of got like addicted to it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know you see these people um i never was die hard you know they they had a story on the news about uh people becoming addicted it's like uh people that do drugs it's it's a high for them
 	
 	
 		that have to do it
 		see i've heard that
 	
 	
 		i've got a couple uh uh a real good friend of mine that i went to school with lives here too she works for The News and Observer and she's the one who got me started running in in college and i i was never
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		die hard like she was it was we had a sleet storm and she was outside running in it icicles hanging down and all this other kind of stuff and i i told her she was crazy but she runs about thirteen miles now
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		yeah
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		she's really training and i when we were in college we both chain smoked like freight trains and she would get out and run everyday and it never would bother her and it's like it don't bother me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and her husband made her stop after she got married her husband made her stop so so now she's just like
 	
 	
 		really
 		that'd be like
 	
 	
 		channeling all of her energy into running now
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good though but i just God
