 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		all right well we're supposed to talk about cars
 	
 	
 		right the car that uh probably the kind we'll get next and
 		i uh
 		i do a lot of driving commute uh i have about uh
 		fifty three miles one way to commute here in Utah but it's uh freeway and it's not bad but uh the cars i've been getting i've got a Toyota
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		it's economical now i've got a Honda now and um and it's a five speed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and for the all the driving i do that uh is the kind i
 		i think i'd probably look at next i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i'll probably look for a family family type vehicle like a van mini van or something because
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i've got two i just uh i've got two young ones so we're we're looking for something that's more family oriented yeah something bigger that we can carry
 	
 	
 		i see
 		a little bit bigger  yeah
 		our family's gone we had six children at one time but they've uh they're all gone and so we we can go to the smaller car now but we did have to have back then it was station wagons
 	
 	
 		six
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		as for a family uh when you start taking much with you or going any place you really need a little more room
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i have a son in Plano Texas who has uh four boys and he got a
 		a van and he really enjoys it
 	
 	
 		hum that's that's right near me
 	
 	
 		is it
 	
 	
 		yeah Plano's a few miles north
 	
 	
 		oh okay well he uh i know i've had several from Richardson
 	
 	
 		who who does he work for
 	
 	
 		he works for JC Penney's
 	
 	
 		oh really corporate office
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		huh uh i've got a i'm taking a class and uh one of the guys that's in my uh my group that
 	
 	
 		yeah he
 	
 	
 		we're doing a group presentation he works for JC Penney
 	
 	
 		um-hum well good yeah he uh he's been down there going on three three years now i guess uh-huh
 	
 	
 		three years they're moving their offices to to Plano right right now
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh they closed at Pittsburgh i think and uh they're moving but it's uh
 		so in fact i was just down there Thursday i was in El Paso and then i had a layover couple hours uh at at Dallas airport
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		airport and they come out and got to visit with them for a while i got i got a new little brand grandbaby and first time i've seen him
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		i don't know i looking at cars you you they say buy American but i  boy of all the people i've talked to that uh
 		seems like they get a lot better mileage i had a hundred and eighty thousand on the Toyota that i had in eighty and that thing i hadn't had any problems at all it was just going strong when i sold it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i guess it's just it depends there's lemons in all of them i guess but uh
 	
 	
 		that's super
 		yeah well American cars are
 		hopefully they'll i think the unions really screwed American cars up they uh
 	
 	
 		i do too yeah
 	
 	
 		you know the the price of the cars are just more than incomes are  because people are you know the people that work at car manufacturers make well the GM plant or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		or yeah the GM plant that they have down here that they're thinking about closing
 		uh the average worker there makes twenty two dollars an hour and that's you know that's more than a lot of people make salary you know professionals make
 	
 	
 		oh wow i've been yeah i've been working
 		well i that's it i've been working for uh
 		oh thirty five years for the the government and think i've got a pretty good job but i don't make that much
 	
 	
 		yeah i didn't either
 	
 	
 		and i've got uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a a degree and everything else you see and i and i don't know hopefully you you'd think that if they were making that kind of money they would try to have a little pride in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in uh the product that they put out so it is a good car but
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh my family's bought uh my sister bought uh a a Buick paid twenty thousand dollars for it she's had nothing but trouble with that thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know you pay that kind of money you should uh it should be trouble free at least for fifty fifty seventy thousand and then
 	
 	
 		sure
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh she's had it in the in the shop garage and shop and she called today and said oh it's uh leaking oil out of the head gasket she's only got about twenty thousand on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so she's got to take that back in and have them work on it but and i and i think it from what i can hear it's just because they uh
 		they don't take the pride that uh the Japanese do or something in in their work or workmanship that when something comes out and their name's on it they want it to to be the best and so i I hate to stay away from American
