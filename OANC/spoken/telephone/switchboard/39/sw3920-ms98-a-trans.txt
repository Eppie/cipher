 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i uh i that's kind of a controversial issue here in the nation's capitol i think we're becoming known as the murder capitol
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so there's a lot of of emphasize on gun control
 		uh i'm not exactly sure where i stand because uh
 		i feel that it may be necessary with the crime coming out this way that we'd be allowed to have the facilities necessary facilities to protect ourselves
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i do know that the District of Columbia has a gun control law and it seems that the number of shootings has gone up since they invoked the law
 	
 	
 		it
 		oh i see
 		yeah well i
 	
 	
 		but the the criminals all have guns now
 	
 	
 		right
 		well they they can get them one way or the other i i think it's uh i probably rate it maybe on the scale of one to ten maybe uh seven or eight
 		uh i think well the automatic weapons and these assault weapons and all of these things that uh i think that is something that
 		uh
 		really be limited but like you say if they take uh if they have gun control control then they take away uh the citizens right to protect themselves
 		and we live out in the west where uh of course i have a number of guns and each one of my sons have guns and we go hunting quite a bit for deer and
 		and uh
 		uh pheasants and things like that and uh they impose a gun control law that would really be disastrous i think because because i think the criminals will get guns no matter what
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where if we were restricted from having them
 		uh or registering them all so that everybody knows who's got them i i don't feel i think that would really take away from our
 		our uh rights and freedoms as as citizens to to bear arms and protect ourselves if necessary
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we have uh
 		well in Fairfax county it's against the law to discharge a firearm
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in fact i think it's against the law to discharge a bow and arrow
 	
 	
 		oh my God
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but the uh they don't have any real strong gun control law
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh whereas just over the border in the District they they have a real strong gun control law
 		Fairfax County is fairly peaceful and uh the District of Columbia is averaging about two murders a day
 	
 	
 		oh boy yeah that i i've read about that that is really tragic i don't know how you could stop that i
 		it  that would be terrible
 		i mean you you don't even know whether you want to go to Washington DC
 	
 	
 		yeah well we i fortunately fortunately work out in the suburbs
 	
 	
 		with
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i just don't go downtown at night
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		and uh a little bit reluctant to go in the day time
 	
 	
 		no
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there've been a few occasions uh i can remember a few years back i was downtown
 		and uh
 		toward quitting time i decided since i was there i'd go visit one of my favorite stores
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it was about six thirty when i left the uh store
 		and i was walking back to my car
 		and boy i tell you i got spooked
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh there were you know people in the alleys making noises at you and
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		people lying around in the park and it was dark and
 		and i i just got scared  i wound up running back to the car
 	
 	
 		yes
 		you would
 		well i know out here uh apparently they've kind of uh uh well they  excuse me in the  Utah area they have
 		uh the women i guess the women and doctors they had a uh hostage situation at uh one of Alta View Hospital in Salt Lake City where uh a fellow came in with a gun and he uh killed one of the nurses and
 		and held the hostages uh all night till they finally finally got him but
 		uh so what they're saying now in the papers that there has been uh uh big increase in nurses and doctors that are buying guns hand guns to protect themselves
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because of this situation that happened and it doesn't happened hasn't happened very often but uh
 		again that's it you hate to to do that but uh
 		we're starting to get some gangs uh they're coming out here and there's been a few shootings drive by shootings and these
 	
 	
 		yeah we've we've had a lot of uh drive-by shootings we have a few people arrested for it going out and shooting just because they felt like killing somebody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just shooting at random i'm kind of sorry to hear that that it's happening in nice rural Utah because uh
 	
 	
 		well it's it's not bad yet but uh there's there it is happened we we we had one of our uh football coaches at one of our high schools in Salt Lake City that uh
 		i guess they were out on the practice field uh last fall and a couple gangs were involved and they shot him in the leg
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh it's
 		it  the police of course are are quite
