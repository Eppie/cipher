 
     		
 	
 		have you recently bought a car Eric or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well well i didn't buy one i just changed jobs changed jobs and got a work car or a company car and uh they bought me a Pontiac Grand Prix and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i've been yeah i've been pretty happy with it i i've been driving just a little little Honda the Honda Civic and stuff so it's a bigger car but i've been pretty pleased with it you know i uh
 	
 	
 		that's a nice car isn't it
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was it's you know got a lot of nice gadgets and stuff but i gosh it's been nice so far i can't say that it's put it through all the loops
 	
 	
 		can you use it for personal too to
 	
 	
 		yeah i can use it for personal and
 	
 	
 		so so you buying a car to you right at this point anyway isn't a a big deal
 	
 	
 		no not really i although we my other we have a second car and it's getting a little bit old it's an eighty five Honda Civic and so we're thinking in a year or two we might have to but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know i i kind of i just like to keep up i you know don't uh don't plan on buying one like i say for a year or two but sooner or later i'm going to have to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		we we just bought two years ago we just bought a a Plymouth Voyager
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's been great we've got family a a family of five three kids and that's the only way to travel as far as i'm concerned the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i bet
 	
 	
 		the kids can get up and move around and you can
 		get them things
 	
 	
 		now is that a is that a full size van or
 	
 	
 		it it's not it's a it's a minivan
 	
 	
 		minivan
 	
 	
 		uh and it was the best rating out of the consumer reports and things
 	
 	
 		oh was it
 		it you do so do you shop the consumer reports when you buy a car then or do you
 	
 	
 		i do i do and
 	
 	
 		do you find that works out pretty good for you
 	
 	
 		yeah we've only bought two new cars i bought a Nissan Sentra
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that um and i really liked it too didn't have any problems with it
 	
 	
 		did you
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and this one has been been an exceptional vehicle we've really enjoyed it especially for kids
 	
 	
 		well that's good to hear yeah that's good to hear some good news about some American made cars i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i uh i really believe they're getting better and you know i i i looked around and seen some of those new Saturns and stuff and they seem to be a really nice car
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		well actually my philosophy about i mean if i was going to buy something for me like
 		a car i'd drive around  unfortunately i'd still get a foreign car i think that Honda makes uh like you've got the Accords are very very well built i also really like the Toyota Camrys
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they're just not practical if you have kids
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		you can't um
 		well if they get older i guess you can take four or five people but when they're small you got to get up and crawl over the seat and you know which doesn't work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah what we found just even going down to our inlaws overnight uh uh this little Honda Civic there's just not enough room we i've just got one daughter by the time you put the car seat and a couple of bags i mean we're just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know we we uh we were having that problem that why there's just not enough room those small cars any more we couldn't go camping because we couldn't put a tent and a cooler in it you know it was so small
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		and uh Chrysler's started doing some nice things with their with their warranties and things i've got a seven year seventy thousand mile warranty on the drive train
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and a three year thirty six six thousand mile on uh i think it's a pretty that's pretty well bumper to bumper
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but the drive train is seven seventy and that's i think that's one of the well i kind of think that the other manufacturers are now uh bumping it up to meet it but Chrysler was the first to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 		yeah
 		they've had that for a while yeah
 		well it says something they're willing at least put something behind it you know they're they feel like turning out a good product and they're at least
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that warranty stuff that's uh i did have to take this company car in and the cassette jammed all of a sudden
 		and it was nice to know that you know that warranty it was still under its warranty and they just took it and took care of it right on the spot but that's definitely something i think i'd shop for i'd want as much warranty as i could because
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		it's expensive to get the things fixed anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if it's not covered
 	
 	
 		and i'm thinking about getting a used car with my next one trying to see if i can't take some of the
 		depreciation off i don't know they're still danger expensive you know i'd you know only i only want to buy something like maybe twenty thousand miles on it they they don't go down much you know unless they're a couple years old or something
 	
 	
 		to buy it
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		no they don't you know they
 		yeah if you get something that's one or two years old uh you can usually knock i i worked at a bank as a loan officer and so i could you know i got into that a little bit you know the dealership financing and stuff but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know at two years makes a huge difference you know they say and it's pretty much true that you drive off the lot and you lose at least a thousand dollars as soon as you take that thing off the lot in value and the Hondas and some of those they don't depreciate as much but you can still get them a little bit cheaper
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i tell you what it's kind of scary uh we bought our company car through an auction a dealer auction and the dealers they they get those things for about half of what they sell them
 	
 	
 		yes
 		you're kidding me
 	
 	
 		i couldn't believe it i uh we stickered the car i got this Grand Prix was stickered at uh sixteen thousand it was a ninety one and had uh had ten thousand miles on it but we ended up getting it for about ten
 		and i mean they bought it for ten they'll sell it for sixteen seventeen thousand i could not believe it had just if you know somebody that's the way to go but unfortunately only the dealers can get in  but uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i tell you i i've been real happy with the Hondas actually we had a have a nineteen eighty Honda Accord too
