 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well Liz what sort of things have you had to return lately because of poor quality
 	
 	
 		well i was just thinking about that i really haven't uh
 		i haven't had to take anything back that there was poor quality i took something back that that wasn't quite what i thought it was
 		uh you know some uh some it i had even called my brother this was a uh back when the winter uh you know when the winter was so bad and uh i wanted a vaporizer and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i had the right brand and it said a lot of the right things on it but then it wasn't exactly the right one i had to take that back but there was nothing wrong with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have you had much trouble with products
 	
 	
 		well i had an interesting experience with a sweater at Christmas time my mother got me two turtleneck sweaters
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		one red one and one black one and i wore the red one and it was fine and i got i was in a hurry one morning to go to work i threw on the black sweater with this suit and i wasn't paying attention i was stuck in a meeting all day with a
 		zipper zipper that was gouging me in the back and the sleeves were too short
 	
 	
 		oh yuck
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and i was in this meeting all day long
 	
 	
 		oh how awful and uncomfortable
 	
 	
 		yes it was
 	
 	
 		and they were both the same make and everything
 	
 	
 		yes same make same size same style everything
 	
 	
 		oh that is frustrating did they take it back
 	
 	
 		yes as a matter of fact i took it back Saturday to Dillard's my mother bought it at Dillard's in Las Cruces New Mexico
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i took it to the local Dillard's and said that you know there's something wrong with this sweater these sleeves are definitely two inches shorter
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm very tall and have long arms so sleeve length is critical
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 		and they were willing to take it back
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah oh well you know now that you mention that i was thinking of how of more of you know kitchen kind of products or or whatever
 		and and i i uh bought the silk shirts that The Limited had and i just loved them
 		and and i bought one out of town and you know at the time i just said could i return it someplace else you know at another Limited they said yes and the silk comes comes i mean i it's i am finding it amazing that you can just put
 		silk in the washing machine but nonetheless so i mean it's so it's sort of like a little miracle anyway but it pulled
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		in you know in the facing in the uh
 		for the
 		where the buttons and the buttonholes are it just the silk just pulled out and i'm a little self conscious about being overweight so you know i kept thinking maybe it's my fault i'm stretching it except the thing just hangs around my body you know
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i i took it back and they just without question let me get another one and now this other one's doing it too and i think what they're doing is not using enough material right there at that seam so that you know it just pulls apart
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i'm not sure that i think i don't know do you think things are
 		worse quality now than they used to be or
 	
 	
 		oh i think some things are clothing definitely
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it seems like you have to pay an awful lot to get decent clothing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and but then other things like oh
 		blue jeans you know always seem to be pretty rugged and pretty tough and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		seem seem to  not just sort of be unchanging yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes but i think anytime you get into high style items things that change all the time that uh
 		think it gets
 		it's tougher for them to maintain the quality
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		course if you listen to the the Japanese politicians we're  going in the ditch for quality and productivity and everything else
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well course uh stuff comes from all over too so uh and i was just thinking about that of of the things that i've that i've uh bought recently
 		i'd i'm a little worried about those long items i just had to buy a new washing machine and uh the one i had was twenty
 		one twenty two years old no
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		no no no no it was more like twenty four years old and just had just gone on beautifully the whole time till the end it finally gave up and i had to
 		i think maybe repaired once in all those years you know so
 	
 	
 		wow
 		so did you buy the same brand the next time
 	
 	
 		well i did so i mean obviously that's what you think about doing it was a it was a Kenmore and um i so i thought about that and then went and found out you well you know these
 		this company and this company's bought and all the companies all the washing machines are made by the same company something like that with different names
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i said well no way  you what do you mean they're all i mean the why would they make them why would they make different ones in different names it's the same company making them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i found that very upsetting and then it made me think about all the things that have been lasting my refrigerator
 		the dryer the dryer's still going
