 
     		
 	
 		well have you had to return any uh merchandise recently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i did i just had to return a pair of shorts i bought for Christmas a winter pair of shorts
 		and the seam was out on the the zipper went out on it right away pulled out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the buttons were loose on it and it was from you know a nice department store
 	
 	
 		yeah  it's interesting it's interesting i really hadn't even given any thought at all to things like buttons and seams but
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		i guess i've just begun to take that for advantage that buttons are not gonna be sewn on i mean took that for uh granted that buttons are not gonna be sewn on very well
 	
 	
 		i guess that's true but it you know you think back and you didn't have to do replace buttons or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah well you're right you're right
 	
 	
 		very long ago it wasn't
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah no i i agree with you
 	
 	
 		but anymore it's pretty common that you do but when the zipper went on this one i said that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that you know that really did it
 	
 	
 		yeah one of my pet peeves is uh neckties uh neckties you know they're just uh uh a nice silk necktie is astronomical
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it has this little um you know sewn on bar on the back of the tie that you tuck it in you know after you've tied it and those little those little some of them bars will inevitably come loose loose loose
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		i know they hang they hang
 	
 	
 		and it drags it just drives me crazy i mean it's an integral part of the tie and it wouldn't take you know what a half a penny of good thread to put it on there securely so um  anyway yeah that's uh that's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know it
 		right
 		yeah
 		yeah there are a lot and and how about uh any appliances i've had that happen with Sunbeam no i'm disgusted i have a Sunbeam beater that we've taken back three times and Sunbeam always had a good name
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now that just really shocks me but i'll tell you that thing hasn't i burnt the motor out twice and i cooked once at Christmas so that's about it anymore
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		but i bake and i'm very disgusted with them
 	
 	
 		yeah i i will i will tell you my experience with appliances Joan has been that uh  well what happened to me i had a a stereo
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that i uh um receiver receiver amplifier that i really liked and it started messing up so i took it to the shop and the minimum charge to even look at it was fifty bucks
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but i you know rationalized and i thought well even if i spend you know seventy five dollars that's cheaper than buying a new one so i wound up spending the nearly a hundred dollars on it
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		took it home it worked maybe two weeks and exactly the same thing happened to it so i took it back to the shop
 	
 	
 		um
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know bottom line is i went through all this gyration and and aggravation and unhooking it and hooking it back up and hauling it back and forth to the repair shop
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		eventually it never worked right again and i i wound up buying a new one i had similar i had a similar thing happen with a television and i'm about i i just came to the conclusion with electronics anyway
 	
 	
 		huh huh huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know if they break throw them away go get a new it
 	
 	
 		and go ahead and get a new one anyway you got a lemon
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah you know and and i think you're better off in the long run just to chunk it and get a new one but i i will have to say you know if you think about things like uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah but yeah
 	
 	
 		as much as stereos for example i can remember the first one i bought whenever i was in college i mean i paid a fortune for it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and you had it forever though
 	
 	
 		well that's true as a matter of fact my i gave the amp to my little brother and he's still using it yeah that is true i'll have i'll have to admit  but they have come down in price but there again they're they're made a lot cheaper
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		right
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah they've come a long way with the difference in the i heard an interesting thing on this morning on the radio to going to work about the Japanese you know they have that big thing about the consumers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and how many more hours they work on it and um
 		they were saying that they did a study on it and the Japanese actually uh i mean the United States actually produces six point five percent more product
 		in the time um more products
 		than Japanese do and the Japanese take twice as much time and work but they don't get the productivity productivity out of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that they do because of the hours they put in that that's what they loose they loose and i thought it was very interesting and they said in the and the unique part of it is that the Japanese are the ones
 		that um did the study it wasn't as though we were doing it to show them they did the study so i got i got got a big kick out of that one
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah so yeah and i i agree with you if we had done it i would have felt maybe it was biased which that's a terrible thing to say but  well i don't know it's um it we're living in an interesting time i mean certainly the Japanese have shown that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they can really produce some quality merchandise and at the same time um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think what it's forced uh American manufacturing to realize is that they're gonna
