 		um i do tole painting
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i really love the tole painting um
 		i haven't done any of the oil or watercolor i would like to learn that some day but right now my passion is tole painting  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		do you do a lot of it
 		yeah i i took one class about i guess three or four years ago and i've done a little
 		um but it takes a lot of time
 	
 	
 		oh
 		it does it is real time consuming and
 	
 	
 		do
 		do you sell your projects
 	
 	
 		uh mostly i have just given them away as gifts um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i've done uh perpetual calendars and
 		cookie jar lids and oh on and on you know just things like that but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job
 	
 	
 		where do you work at
 	
 	
 		i just work at Stop and Shop out there in in Ogden so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique
 	
 	
 		no i've wanted to do that uh but just haven't just haven't mass produced enough to do that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i have five children of my own so it's
 	
 	
 		that keeps you busy
 	
 	
 		they they keep me busy and tole painting's just a you know something i do in my spare time so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh have you tried any of the well do you cut out your own projects
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh i have my own saws and so i really enjoy doing that
 	
 	
 		huh
 		do you um ever spray your projects with uh i mean a base coat first or do you brush it all on
 	
 	
 		i brush it on yeah i haven't tried a a spray varnish
 		i use just a wood sealer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		i just bought a spray gun one of those airless um not airless high volume low pressure spray guns
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i do a lot of wood working and that's what i bought it for
 	
 	
 		do you oh
 	
 	
 		but i haven't used it yet
 	
 	
 		oh well that's that  probably give you a smoother finish wouldn't it oh now what type of wood working do you do
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um fine uh furniture type stuff yeah
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		that's why i brought bought the sprayer is to finish my projects that's my worst
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		worst part of my wood working i get so sick of making it
 	
 	
 		oh  but it's hard to finish it huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but spraying does put on a nicer finish
 	
 	
 		oh well that is interesting so what kind of equipment do you have
 	
 	
 		for wood working um let me see table saw scroll saw band saw lathe routers and that's about it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		boy it sounds like you're really into it that is nice
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		yeah i i just have a scroll saw and a jig saw and i am really anxious to get a band saw and a router
 	
 	
 		yeah the band saw's really nice i have an Inca i don't know if you've ever heard of those
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but yeah it's nice to have the right equipment
 	
 	
 		yeah that is that makes it easier doesn't it well have you sold any of your furniture or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just
 	
 	
 		um not mostly i do like you do give it away as gifts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh making my own furniture
 	
 	
 		well

 		um just in junior high and then i just kept on through high school and then bought my own equipment
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kept up with that
