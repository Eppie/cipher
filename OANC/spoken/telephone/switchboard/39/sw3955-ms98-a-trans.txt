 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well in the organized  i'm with Department of Defense and uh we have random drug testing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		the last couple of years and people have really you just accepted that of course the soldiers and then uh the civilians they haven't done the civilians yet but
 		personally i don't think see anything wrong with it uh i think it's a protection to employers and to employees and everybody else if
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah the in my mind the people that say that it's in violation of their privacy it's
 		it's actually a violation of the people they work with if uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's not fair to have people working around you that uh could cause accidents or harm to yourself
 	
 	
 		you bet
 		i really like it the way they do it in the in the military they go by social security numbers and they take the last number and uh
 		so it uh
 		and it it or or just pick a last number social security numbers uh and that's the way they do it and it works really well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i work with recruiters a lot and they have uh
 		they have it monthly with recruiters
 	
 	
 		is that mandatory for the recruiters
 	
 	
 		uh no no uh they do it that way but uh well it's every three months excuse me every three months
 		and they have uh we have about um oh a hundred and fifteen recruiters in our area
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they have  a fourth of them every three months they on a random basis
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		has
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		has your number come up
 	
 	
 		no no hasn't come up i don't know i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's fine if it does i  the only thing you have to be careful if i know all those who join the service
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh it is mandatory that they're tested for drugs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh if drugs are found uh in the system
 		then uh they're barred for enlistment for six months and then they can come back once and test again and if it's uh still positive then they can't join
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		they've really cracked down on that and uh i think that's that's good because the source of the bad crime of reputation for for drugs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it's surprising uh since they've been on well the first couple of months this has been around for about a year and a half
 		the first few months there was quite a few that were disqualified and uh since then you just never hear of it i guess the word got out and the kids know that if they want to commit and and join then uh they have to be straight
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		the only thing that's kind of scary if you eat one of these buns with cinnamon with these uh poppy seeds on it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and that would show up
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		no  no it's it's uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's kind of strange uh but uh yeah they they tell them that if they uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if they're going to if they come into the motel to stay overnight
 		prior to being physical and tested and then so forth they tell them not to eat anything with poppy seeds on it a hard roll if they're having lunch or something or dinner but
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 		well what does it test uh for
 	
 	
 		well i'm not sure and it just shows that they're uh uh
 		but they they specify that or just tell them that they'll have to kind of be careful well and it's the same with alcoholic beverages they they test for that too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i think it's great i really do i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but in the work place i i feel that it it should be uh something that the employers have the right to do if they want
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to protect everyone concerned and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the the only problem i can see and i've heard is the the fact that if they uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		if the test whoever runs the test they've got to make sure they run it correctly so it's not a a misreading on it or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that that's happened in some instances i guess
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i think they're pretty well i've heard what i've heard and especially the ones that that test the the soldiers they uh
 		they make sure they they run them correctly and uh have the right right person with right sample and everything but
 	
 	
 		um-hum my my company's small enough here that uh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		in fact i don't know of any companies right around the Twin Falls area that's testing i'm sure they're here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i certainly wouldn't be opposed um is is it hard for you to tell people that are on drugs i mean
 		and i don't know how you can confirm that or not but uh
 		uh i'd really be surprised if someone in my company was using drugs now it doesn't mean they're that they're not there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and maybe the testing wouldn't you know show that they were there
 	
 	
 		yeah i especially the the uh alcoholic alcohol part of it uh that's a that's a thing that uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		you can see that pretty easy can't you
 	
 	
 		yeah right you really can you can and uh
