 		do you really
 		really so how come you like subscribing to them
 	
 	
 		well because i i i have a lot of interests and and the magazines have a lot of interesting articles and
 		and it's just my way to keep up and my wife's sitting here telling me it's because i'm a bookworm  uh so she calls it a true bookworm no i like to read and so i take a lot of magazines

 		uh-huh so you get a well you get a lot see i'm in college so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i usually get mostly business magazines so so all the magazines i ever see they're just advertising so i don't ever subscribe to them so but that's good though

 		see my parents are from Dallas and they started in and they sent it to me and so that's how i got started
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so i thought well i can do this you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's not too hard but i i've called in a couple times but then like i said it was down so much that i got out of the habit and then i'm not usually home so i'm not usually here when when when when they try because i don't i haven't done it very often
 	
 	
 		when they try and call yeah
 		yeah i just started so i'm always like now what do i do i'm always like what
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't
 	
 	
 		but didn't you have to fill out a form where it said that you would check off magazines and stuff on it
 	
 	
 		yeah but i didn't know they'd ask me if i subscribed to them i can talk about magazines
 	
 	
 		well now what magazines do you like to read
 	
 	
 		um hm see i really i mean i don't even read i don't even grab mine or even look at them
 	
 	
 		well if you had a hundred bucks and you couldn't do anything except spend them on magazines what magazines would you would you get would you would you buy
 	
 	
 		well i think right now i'd buy Bride because i just got engaged so i'd buy that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		those magazines are like phone books aren't they they're like two thousand pages of advertising uh uh of ads or something in them
 	
 	
 		i know they're huge
 		i know i think i'd buy like Home and Gardens and stuff like that yeah i like stuff like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really really
 		really
 	
 	
 		i used to get like a horse magazines and stuff i used to show horses so yeah
 	
 	
 		really that's neat
 	
 	
 		so you see a lot of horse magazines but that was quite a while ago
 	
 	
 		there so did you did you uh um uh uh ride them and stuff what do they call it Dursege and
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to ride them English uh-huh hunter jumper
 	
 	
 		um-hum  well that's good
 	
 	
 		so i used to get lots of magazines for that but every since i stopped at that and went to college and i really haven't got any more magazines for that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum um-hum my
 	
 	
 		but those are probably the only two magazines i'd get
 	
 	
 		well you could buy an awful lot of Bride magazines for a hundred dollars i don't know it it
 	
 	
 		i know that's right
 	
 	
 		we have some newsstands here in Dallas you know that have like thousands of magazines and i could buy a lot i could buy a lot of magazines
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you get a lot of them that's great though
 	
 	
 		well there's more that i could get
 	
 	
 		that's great though because especially with business though because i know like with business stuff because when they first asked me this i was like well God i they're like why do you like articles or or
 		why do you not like magazines i was like because it has so many advertising but business ones don't really and they're really informative
 	
 	
 		um-hum well they have a lot of they i don't know they have a lot of different different kinds of ads and stuff in them
 	
 	
 		yeah but they're very they're very informative informative i think that's great
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		i guess so what are you majoring in out there
 	
 	
 		um i major in psychology in family studies yeah
 	
 	
 		really

 		you you you like Lubbock better than Dallas why
 	
 	
 		yeah uh because people are so much nicer yes
