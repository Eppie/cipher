 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what kind of music do you like
 	
 	
 		well i i like uh i guess it would be easier to say tell you what kind i don't like i don't like hard rock
 		uh
 		but other than that i i like just about every kind i
 		i'm not real crazy about modern uh country and western i i like the old uh
 		uh country western songs that i grew up with uh
 		San Antonio Rose
 		and uh the Sons of the Pioneers Cool Water and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		oh now that i don't know
 	
 	
 		well see you're not as old as i am
 	
 	
 		
 
 		either that or i didn't listen to Sons of the Pioneers i've heard about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		in fact i have a friend who uh plays hammered dulcimer and sings uh yodel cowboy yodeling songs and she talked
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		talks about
 		Patsy Montana
 		i think you know who that was
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		no
 		well that she she
 		that was
 		i gather an old
 		cowgirl who used to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sing songs like that
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i like the old Hank Williams songs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh the modern kind it seems to me it all sounds just pretty much alike
 	
 	
 		pretty much like like rock
 	
 	
 		um yeah well
 	
 	
 		or or
 		or just too similar to each other
 	
 	
 		it's hard to tell one song from yeah it's hard to tell one song from the other
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		too too be truthful with you i'm sort of a Beethoven and Bach fan
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i like all of that i like classical i when i look at my tapes it's hard to tell i like Celtic music i like classical
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i like uh some of the new age music
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i like uh blues uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Muddy Waters people like that i like uh
 		uh
 		what else do i have
 		folk music
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i like folk music a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a good friend who grew up in Mexico she's been in this country oh about twelve fifteen years
 		and uh uh
 		she gave me a tape uh of some Spanish music
 		oh what is that dance
 		with the ladies in the long dress and the fans
 	
 	
 		uh oh you mean uh flamenco oh yes that's beautiful
 	
 	
 		yeah flamenco
 		it's modern day flamenco music
 	
 	
 		yeah flamenco's beautiful
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's really different and it's really pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well that that i like and i used to live in Mexico so i like i like Mexican music to a certain extent just because because it reminds me of that time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then uh um
 		do you play anything
 	
 	
 		well there're two schools of thought on that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you mean yours and everyone else's
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i i played in the band in in college i played the clarinet B flat clarinet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then uh i took a semester as an elective i took a semester of class piano and i have a piano and an and an organ not a very fancy organ
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		but it's an old Hammond
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and uh i i can sight read most church hymns
 		and uh
 		oh the First Movement of Moonlight sonata that goes of course very slowly
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and do you do it do you play
 	
 	
 		no not as on a regular basis
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i

 		activity if i can ever ever retire
 	
 	
 		well i
 		and get back and get back into trying something with music huh

 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh well that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah so so i i i do keep up to that extent
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do do you play any instruments
 	
 	
 		no well i played the piano you know as a child uh
 		for years and then quit and then kind of enjoyed it and took the guitar and
 		played the guitar a little bit and i can sight read uh and we have a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		piano my son was a percussionist and so he has we have a marimba and a drum set if i were to take anything i think i would take drums i just loved it when he did that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in in fact one time uh i bought a a two hour session with his teacher for a
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		lady who said she would had always wanted to go and just play all of those percussion instruments that you see including the gong the big big gong
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so he let us into the percussion room and we got to play on every single instrument
 	
 	
 		listen let let me tell you what my uh my retirement job's going to be
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		uh i've just been to the Meyerson one time and the first part was oh Schubert and you know the usual stuff and then there was this very modern day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		piece that had no rhythm no tune and just sounded like a bunch of racket
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in the the middle of the stage was this box about oh four by four by four covered with black black what i have no idea
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
