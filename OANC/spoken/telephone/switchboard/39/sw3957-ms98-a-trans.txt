 
     		
 	
 		okay how do you feel about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i feel like the major problem we have and the reason that crime has gotten so out of hand is because there isn't a punishment that's matching what's being done
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i agree with that
 	
 	
 		and i think it starts when the kids are little i think the parents in our community teach our children that as long as they can get away with something that it's all right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i don't see a lot of parents especially where i'm at i have a lot of the responsibility of what ever is done in our neighborhood because there's no other mothers at home
 	
 	
 		yes i have the same thing here
 	
 	
 		and i see a lot of kids very small kids coming home to empty homes every day and doing all kinds of unbelievable things and as long as they don't let anybody know about it they get away with it  so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i feel like if our parents mothers stayed home if we had that secure start you know where kids learned the right way to act um they were rewarded for their good behavior
 		and they had a secure family that they came from i think we'd see a whole different society
 	
 	
 		yeah that kind of goes right along with what i'm thinking too is well the movies and the TV the violence and all the
 		things that are on there if the parents were home in the afternoon when the children came home maybe they wouldn't be watching as much as this
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but then again there's some of them at home at night with them that do not monitor what their children are watching
 		and so it's i think you're right in that it is parents caring enough to may be put off having that other car or the other TV or what ever it is they're working for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and take care of the children
 	
 	
 		well you know i did a survey on why mothers left their children to go to work  and i found out that more than eighty percent of all the people i talked to
 	
 	
 		um-hum  what'd you find out
 	
 	
 		the mothers went to work to provide a better life for their children and when i talked with their children their children wanted their parents home rather than the the the material things they were getting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i i can believe that
 	
 	
 		and it's just too bad that the parents won't listen to this survey
 		so  i just think that um another problem is i think the way the legal system has been set up that the criminals get out and the jails are so over crowded they can't handle punishing the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		people that are committing the bad crimes
 		sufficiently i think they need to put more people out to death um if it's completely witnessed and it's uh seen that there's no
 		you know i think there needs to be more severe punishment but it needs to be fair
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right but and maybe not quite so much publicity either i think there's far too much publicity on some of these violent crimes that and then it seems to become a challenge
 	
 	
 		right i think that
 		to oh out do it
 	
 	
 		to be shown to people to see if they can get away with it
 	
 	
 		yeah or out do what's been done
 	
 	
 		right that it's
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's another problem um i know that once when i was reading a book when i was studying history
 		and it said you show me a country that can produce strong families and you'll have a strong country
 		and if you look back over United States histories our country was strong until the mothers started leaving the home
 	
 	
 		um-hum women's rights and all these good things  the children are the ones who suffer
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right and they do and then they grow up and it just continually will get worse
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes and and
 	
 	
 		so
 		i guess what we both agree on is that families need to change their way of thinking
 	
 	
 		right right yes and until the families change i think that we'll continue to have this problem and it will worsen
 	
 	
 		right and i think people need to have some sort of a an idea of why we're here and what we're doing and what we're working towards and why it's important to do these things rather than just getting ahead materialistically
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh uh back to the old basic morals and
 	
 	
 		that's right  well um do they come do they come on and say when we've talked visited for five minutes
 	
 	
 		and things that
 		i i don't know i i thought they did but this is my first time also so well but in
 	
 	
 		this is your first time
 		um
 		we discussed i discussed on here with someone um last week about the justice system and how it could be improved on juries and we discussed about how half the jury that they select to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know come up with the verdict if half of those were law students then they could understand what was going on in the court room
 		and have the time that they spent in their jury district count towards some of their graduation hours
 	
 	
 		hey that would be a good idea  that's
 	
 	
 		wouldn't that be a good idea because i think so sometimes the juries don't understand all this the legal you know talk and and what's going on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and this way it would get people that were a little more knowledgeable at least half of them
 		to be on that board or on the jury
 	
 	
 		that
