 		i'm Bridget
 	
 	
 		i'm Barbara
 	
 	
 		it's nice to meet you
 	
 	
 		well it's nice to meet you where are you from
 	
 	
 		i'm in Lubbock
 	
 	
 		oh i'm in Garland
 	
 	
 		are you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay good you ready for me to push one then okay
 	
 	
 		yes i am
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so what kind of clothes do you wear to work
 	
 	
 		i wear dresses skirts um
 		that type of attire i'm a secretary
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		are you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay well this is kind of a hard topic because i don't work
 	
 	
 		you don't
 	
 	
 		no i'm in college so
 	
 	
 		oh so you can dress carefree right
 	
 	
 		but i think
 		that's right i have on a sweat shirt right now and and jeans  and i feel great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		what is your best mode of clothing
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		what is your best mode of clothing you like blue jeans best
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i think if i was going to go to work and stuff i think a dress or more like a suit would would be more appropriate for sure
 	
 	
 		yes that's what i wear mainly is suits cotton or um gabardine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		wool  sometimes in winter but here in Texas you don't really need wool that often
 	
 	
 		yeah doesn't get that hot
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i don't know i can't i would i wouldn't like to have to wear a suit every day though i wouldn't like that at all
 	
 	
 		no i don't do it every day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just occasionally do you have a certain fabric you like better than others
 	
 	
 		um
 		with dress clothes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i honestly i don't know because
 		i haven't had to wear that many dress clothes yet to be honest you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i really don't think i i don't even i couldn't even tell you
 		but i would say i don't know
 	
 	
 		well i like cotton the best it's easier to take care of and it's it's uh a much fresher freer and freer fabric
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true anything you don't have to iron that you can just send to the cleaners sounds great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well cotton you have to iron unfortunately or send to the cleaners but there's some fabrics like you said that uh gabardines and suedes and that that have to go to the cleaners all the time
 	
 	
 		really do you wear really dressy dresses to work
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes yes i'm up in corporate
 	
 	
 		do you oh okay so you go all out and everything
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah well that would be important though i mean you would have to
 	
 	
 		yes because the first person they see is the secretary before the boss and uh i couldn't uh get away with blue jeans and a T-shirt
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i bet you couldn't
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you wear sneakers do you wear um
 		brand names or do you just get something off the shelf at the stores
 	
 	
 		um i usually get like i usually get Nike
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with shoes and stuff like that
 		i'm real big my feet get real sore real easily so i have to have really well padded shoes
 	
 	
 		i see do you like sweaters
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i love sweaters
 	
 	
 		do you wear them often
 	
 	
 		yeah because it gets really cold up here i mean you get the turtle neck sweater jacket thing a lot
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i mean i would say mostly like now it's like you could wear like a T-shirt or sweat shirt because it's usually chilly in the morning but it's it's warmer at night
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but in the winter you have to bundle up because it gets really cold
 		it's a lot different because i i'm from Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh are you
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's a lot colder than it does in Dallas that's for sure with all the snow and everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that was my next question is to how you where you used to live and how you dressed in comparison to where you were before
 	
 	
 		yeah because i because i am from Dallas and i live in Richardson so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean it gets cold there but it's not cold like it gets here and i think here it gets cold and it gets windy you have a you know wind chill at twenty miles an hour and it gets like bitter cold
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you have to walk across campus and stuff so you really wear a lot of clothes i mean everybody has on like gloves and scarves and ear muffs and everything
 	
 	
 		are you into hats
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		do you wear hats and for dress up too or just
 		in winter
 	
 	
 		um
 		hum i have like one and i wear it when i dress up
 		but otherwise i don't have that many though i don't think about it i'm not real good at picking out clothes like if someone were to buy me an outfit and put out with it i would wear it all the time but as far as me picking out clothes myself oh it's not very good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		hum in your new uh career after college you going to need clothes a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah i probably will go to graduate school because i want to be a marriage counselor
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i'll still need nice clothes you know whatever i do if i do that or if i go into business then i'll still need dress clothes like nice dresses and nice suits and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's what i plan on waning wearing to work when i go to work
 		to the
 	
 	
 		do you like clothes for uh different seasons or do you like just to wear the basically the same type of thing and just add or take away from it
 	
 	
 		um
