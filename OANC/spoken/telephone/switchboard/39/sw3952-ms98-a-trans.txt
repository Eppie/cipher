 		all right
 		oh
 		yeah i i used to go to a gym um last summer but then i started school again so it's um so i don't exercise as much as i'd like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i i do enjoy um going to a gym and working out or just like i do sit ups sometimes before i go to bed or when i wake up and i ride a exercise bike a lot so
 	
 	
 		uh-hum  well i try to do it at night before i go to bed um it's really weird because i'll get down on the floor and i'll holler and tell my cat Nikki i'll say Nikki i'm going to do my exercises now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and she can be upstairs in the bedroom and i don't know she knows what i'm talking about you know pretty soon here she comes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercisings you know uh i had a problem with my back so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when i went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i just try to keep that up because it seems like if i don't then then my back gives me a problem again
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i try to do it every night and uh yeah it seems like it's
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		you know i can tell when i do it and when i don't do it you know so you know it's got to be good for you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um a long time ago i belonged to a gym but uh now i notice that this in this small city that i live in they do have a a gym that just opened up here about a month ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so i was kind of thinking about joining it but i haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um it does really make you feel good and i like to bicycle too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so that gives you you know lots of exercise
 	
 	
 		yeah it does yeah i enjoy that a lot i um bike in the summer i belong to a biking club here in Kenosha
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um we go on a like fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday so  i try to uh keep up in the winter with the exercise bike so i'm you know can be in shape and that could
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 		yeah otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far huh
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh  no i go with my dad he exercises a lot more than i do though  oh yeah he's always exercising
 	
 	
 		oh really uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i'm not that energetic i can get lazy sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well like i say i just do it at night you know and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you like you try try to get my stomach muscles toned up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's what i like to do
 	
 	
 		you know because boy they seem like they really get out of shape and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so i just been doing it i try to do it every night you know like i say it just i'd rather do that than watch television anyhow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		you know  so it just kind of nice and especially when i have my cat that comes down and joins me
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that is neat
 	
 	
 		you know so well i guess that's about all and i can tell you about my exercising i wish i knew how to swim but i don't so i don't go swimming
 	
 	
 		yeah um i don't swim much neither
 	
 	
 		um-hum but they do say that swimming is really really good for you you know for every part of your body
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i wished i i wished i did know how to do that if they had a pool here in Patterson i'd probably you know put my bathing suit on and go down there but they don't have a pool in this small city either
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so  well listen then it's been nice talking to you
