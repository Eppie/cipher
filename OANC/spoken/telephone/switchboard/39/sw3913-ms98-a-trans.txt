 
     		
 	
 		the opportunity to uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		talk with someone with my name
 	
 	
 		no there's really not very many
 	
 	
 		no there really aren't
 	
 	
 		uh when i went to school there was probably three
 		you know in various ages but you don't you don't find that name very often
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's interesting well are you uh involved in any kind of home repair projects right now
 	
 	
 		uh we just got through having the ceiling in the kitchen touched up
 	
 	
 		did y'all have
 	
 	
 		the roof we had a lot of rain and the roof was leaking and it went down and had a big spot on the ceiling
 		and we intended to to fix it ourselves
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that didn't work so we ended up hiring just uh a handy man and it turned into a huge project for him
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and he couldn't he tried to match the spot and he couldn't match it and ended up having to do the whole ceiling over
 	
 	
 		the whole  well we have a spot just like that in our kitchen
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but we haven't uh it's just a stain you know it's not really it's a stain on the paint it's not where water actually leaked
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh on the floor i mean it's not like a hole in the ceiling
 		and um i don't know i know there's stuff you can get sealer and stuff that actually has some color to it but we are probably going to have to end up repainting the whole ceiling too
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so but we tried just at first just kind of spackling it it's one of those type ceilings this is an older house and we were trying to just repair that and match the the uh texture
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and we couldn't do that and then
 	
 	
 		uh
 		is it like a is it like a popcorn ceiling or what's the texture
 	
 	
 		it's i'm not even sure what it is it's not like the kind at my mother's house is a blown texture
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and this is an old older house and it's kind of a
 		sponge is what it looks like to me
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		that they took the uh plaster and kind of sponged it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but it's a different pattern and he had so much trouble trying to match it
 		and the paint and everything he finally just had to redo the whole ceiling repaint the whole thing
 	
 	
 		well that's probably the easiest thing to do i guess in that case
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but he uh i was surprised he stuck with the price that he had quoted
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		which was just a couple a hundred dollars to fix the one place and then he found out that the beam there was not support to attach his stuff to and it turned out to be a mess
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		he finally finally got it finished
 	
 	
 		well
 		and it looks nice
 	
 	
 		it does i was i because it took several days and i work so he was on his own during the house during the day and then i would just have to come home and call him at night and say excuse me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		this doesn't look good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because he was going to let it go if i hadn't said anything at first when it didn't match and stuff he was just going to go with that
 		and i am sure nobody would notice if they come in they don't look up immediately but i noticed but when he fixed it
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but this the house it belongs to my father-in-law and our deal as far as living here and each month we fix something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we put a deck in and we landscaped the yard and we put new carpeting in and we put new linoleum in and then we had the ceiling fixed and put a new floor in the bathroom
 		and wallpaper but just as soon as you get finished with one job it's time for another one
 	
 	
 		well we are in the midst of all that now too we've lived in our house for uh  two years and uh
 		my dog it's just uh she's like a child she wants to play  as soon as you get the phone she my dog is trying to uh a fifty pound dog is trying to get in my lap uh anyway uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so we really have not done much to the house we kind of worked on the landscaping outside but
 		but this year we've made uh kind of a list of things we want to do and we devote half of every Saturday to our work projects and then one night a week and uh so right now we are painting our master bedroom
 		actually it's my husband i can't  i am expecting so i am not suppose to be around the paint fumes  so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well see you chose a good job well congratulations when is your baby due
 	
 	
 		yeah i chose a good job so i don't have to help
 		when is it due July
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that good it won't be too hot
 	
 	
 		so we're we're working on the master bedroom first and then we'll eventually get to the baby's room and you know try to decide what we want to do in there but uh we have  the people that lived here before us uh
 		uh the house is about twelve years old and ouch she just tried to bite me uh but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it it's a custom home and it has a lot of neat things to it but they also went i think a cheap route you know that they on some things and there's one wall in this bedroom that uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that uh are in one of our guest bedrooms that was painted gray and the rest of the walls are white and it looks like it must have had wallpaper on it
 		and they took the wallpaper off and then tried to re-texture it and it's horrible it just looks like it just rained
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
