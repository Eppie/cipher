 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		together and uh so personally  lot of the hobbies that i had when i was growing up um in going to college and so forth are have changed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i really enjoyed uh mountain climbing i really enjoyed skiing um
 		and a lot of outdoor activities and uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in in Texas i can go skiing with that right now but hopefully i'll be able to get back to the slopes someday so
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		yeah i i've not had the opportunity to to go skiing but
 		i grew up in Arizona which had some mountains around it but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		never did get out and ski
 	
 	
 		you didn't
 	
 	
 		no i never did didn't have the i guess i didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing and of course i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken places places i couldn't go by myself but
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		and then of course then once i got to the age where i could've done it myself i had other interests i guess so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i guess that for me it was very helpful my two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and so we we went quite often and uh in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing and when i lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago and we would we would go skiing and enjoy that
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so but uh luckily it's it's kind of unusual because hobbies
 		it's a it's a nice thing to have and it's it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time but like you mentioned and i am finding out a lot of the spare time that i had isn't there
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's uh taken up by activities with uh work with family with um civic and church responsibilities for me
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah i i find that if i i make i have to make myself to realize that it's important to get out there and not you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me
 	
 	
 		oh yes oh yes oh yes
