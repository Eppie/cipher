 		bass fishing in fact we just came from a tournament this weekend huh
 	
 	
 		bass
 		is that right how'd you do how did you do
 	
 	
 		well i weighed in a fish my husband didn't  so i'm ahead of him right now
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh do you is it a two day event or
 	
 	
 		this one was just a one day sometimes we have two days
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's uh with the TI Bass Club
 	
 	
 		huh did how how do those tournaments work you know i've seen them on television and stuff uh
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um  um is it based on the total pounds of fish that you can catch or how do they do it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah  it's based on the  total pounds and you go according to the lake rules like most lakes you can't weigh one in that's under fourteen inches
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and so i got one that was just fourteen inches so i weighed it in it was a little over a pound
 	
 	
 		um do they have men and women's divisions or is it just all everybody
 	
 	
 		in our in our club it's men and women mixed we have a lot of couple's teams
 	
 	
 		i see
 		so it's the you do it as a joint combination
 	
 	
 		well we have the individual uh you weigh in as individuals and then you uh combine your totals as a team so they award prizes for individual and team
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i see do you do you fish for a particular team like TI like you were telling me or
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah in our club we um
 		uh the Lewisville TI we have our club and we all fish together once a month and then once a year we get together with the rest of the TI bass clubs and we compete as as a club against the others
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		huh
 		that sounds fun
 	
 	
 		yeah we have good time
 	
 	
 		do you fish for anything besides bass
 	
 	
 		no hum-um  sometimes at night we'll go out crappie fishing but just to be going out it's not a tournament or anything what kind do you do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yep
 		uh mainly salmon and steel head king uh king salmon chinook and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i i enjoy a little bit of trout fishing fly fishing out of float tubes on high mountain lakes i enjoy that that's probably my favorite
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		ooh how fun
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a lot of fun that is a lot of fun um uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the king the king salmon fishing too is fun too we i got to Alaska this year most of the time we just spend fishing around here but
 	
 	
 		wow um-hum
 	
 	
 		that was a lot of fun we got into some really nice fishing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		uh one night i went down on a river called the Kishloff River
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they were catching uh red salmon they're smaller salmon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i started fishing about eleven o'clock at night  and i fished until three o'clock in the morning and i must have caught twenty salmon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and it was just great it was about every fifth cast you'd hook one and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they were anywhere between eight and twelve fifteen pounds and
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		it just wonderful the the water was very swift and fast and and so uh the fish were even with twenty pound test line i was breaking them off uh you know quite frequently
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so but that that's probably the best fishing i've been in in my whole life was that night there
 	
 	
 		wow that sounds neat huh
 	
 	
 		yep have have you ever uh
 		have you ever been salmon fishing at all
 	
 	
 		um in Lake Lake Michigan they have salmon there okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum yes uh-huh you troll with them troll for them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah we uh we were up there one year for a family reunion and it we went out on Lake Michigan  and but the weather was so bad we couldn't go out very far and we didn't stay out very long at all
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so my husband got one and the rest of didn't get anything  so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well if you ever get a chance to go to Alaska boy uh the the
 	
 	
 		oh i would love to
 	
 	
 		the the biggest problem is you get hooked on it now you know so uh i can't i can't make it next year but in ninety three i'm sure trying to go back and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you just it's almost like you can't get your fill of it it is it is so it's just nothing like what we're we've got around here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh the halibut fishing was great  we went out in the ocean one day and actually two days and they got us over a bed of halibut
 	
 	
 		wow
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there was three of us in the boat fishing and probably every five minutes somebody had a halibut on
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		it was great they weren't very big the biggest one we caught that day was thirty five pounds but uh uh it just lots and lots of action
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh so i really enjoyed that
