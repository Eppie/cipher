 
     		
 	
 		well Wendy have you had any uh experiences with your nieces in school to indicate that something's wrong with the school system
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they they don't seem to discipline the children like they used to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now when i was in school i'm i'm only twenty nine and i i hadn't been out of college that long but when we were in grade school
 		we you know if you got in trouble you definitely got paddled or you know something something was done and now they can't touch the children
 	
 	
 		yeah do you think that's the fault of the school system or society or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it's really a combination the fact that so many parents refuse to let the school discipline their children and the fact that they let
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		parents or or people file law suits for one thing i have a friend that is a teacher in Houston
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and she says the kids can hit you kick you stab you and you can not touch them and if you touch them then they can sue you and they can sue sue the school system
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so it's really no more a failure of society
 	
 	
 		i i think so i think so and and i you couldn't pay me enough to be a teacher in a bad in a bad city
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		and and and our town where you know maybe thirty thousand people there's not a problem
 	
 	
 		i have a friend who's a principal of a Dallas school  the stories she tells oh yes
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah
 		it's unbelievable the things and and of course the sweet little kids
 	
 	
 		within
 		well the neighborhood that she's in is is very economically deprived and that is reflected in the students abilities i mean they have no support at home
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so for if you casually looked at it you could say maybe the test scores in that school are bad and and therefore there's a failure of the public school system
 		but when the parents are not interested or don't have the resources or
 		can't even read themselves
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that sort of thing it it's bound to affect the education of the children
 	
 	
 		well yeah and the fact that they're not putting enough money
 		into the schools
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		you know and they don't even have adequate facilities is
 	
 	
 		i just wonder where all the money goes i mean my
 	
 	
 		well isn't isn't that the truth
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my taxes are exorbitant
 		and  i i i don't think you solve problems too much by throwing money at it i think you have to get the parents interested and have to get the community support and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum and and let the school give them a little more you're right give them a little more support and a little more to work with
 		and as these kids you know as the kids get older it's it's even harder yeah because then you know their minds are made up as to what they're gonna do by then
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is
 		well yes and if you don't develop an interest in reading at an early age it gets awfully hard a lot later on
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah they see no point you know we've gotten away with it this far
 	
 	
 		that's right but again society's uh influences i think can affect how well the students perform more than this than what the public school is or is not doing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean certainly  drugs and and peer pressures of that sort
 		can again make the students fail and therefore look like that there's something something deficient about the public school system
 	
 	
 		yeah and it just frightens me when i think about  having a child and sending them to school where they're they're selling drugs in in grade school
 	
 	
 		
 
 		isn't that scary
 	
 	
 		i can't imagine i mean we wouldn't even have known what they were talking about let alone take something or you know sell it buy it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i just can't imagine that it has has come so far
 		that there's little kids dealing drugs and older kids dealing to the little kids and
 	
 	
 		that's right but then then again that's something that that's very difficult for the schools to try to control
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this principal i know does the best she can in terms of dealing with students this is a grade school students who are members of gangs
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		yes students who carry weapons to school
 	
 	
 		um  and when we were little when we went to grade school we lived in Waxahachie and little bitty town you know little bitty school
 		and there was i i i just  it is beyond my comprehension
 		to imagine grade schoolers with weapons and and gangs
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's just you might as well just have a police file on them
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know because you you know you you learn who the leaders are and you know what they're doing and it's you can't do anything to them
 	
 	
 		that's right but when there are disruptive influences like that in the school i think it makes it especially difficult for the children who want to learn
 	
 	
 		it really does
 		because even even the ones that are that want to will let the other ones bully them out of it
