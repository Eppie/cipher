 		i don't really have a favorite type i like uh a lot of different types of music
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a a tape collection that i like to listen to uh cassette tapes but it's pretty varied yeah how about you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh i i'm very uh i'm very varied as well i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't think i've
 		ever met a type of music i don't like except for uh maybe you know heavy metal and that
 	
 	
 		that's exactly me the acid rock or the heavy metal even some of that i like okay but not mostly as a general rule i don't care for that at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah  i don't enjoy rap too much either that that doesn't appeal to uh uh my ears
 	
 	
 		well as far as the rap goes i think there are a few artists that appeal to me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		themselves and i like some of their songs but as as i agree as a general rule i i wouldn't choose rap either
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i i like to listen to uh what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz  uh classical um  i i like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i like uh like i said pretty varied uh music i have a couple that my husband really hates when i listen to them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like uh Billy Holiday i really love to listen to her and uh i even have a a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		and well i mean they're very harmonic they really are
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh yeah sure
 	
 	
 		so they're interesting to listen to you might try that how about you
 	
 	
 		uh well um i i listen to uh specific most most most likely i would be listen to uh jazz or classical music um  i
 		in college i took uh a four years of classical guitar and i played in the in the jazz combo all four years i played guitar for the jazz combo so uh  that's where my two
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		my two listening enjoyments are but but you know jazz can get on my nerves after a while uh you can't just listen to it you know to uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		especially a lot of the deeper stuff you just can't listen to it for enjoyment unless you're
 	
 	
 		it it's too um uh you have to concentrate on it it seems
 	
 	
 		yeah unless unless you're playing it just it just doesn't do anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what about the blues or something like that
 	
 	
 		uh uh blues are okay i i tell you i do like um i grew up on blue grass music my dad is a big blue grass fan and so um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i wouldn't have admitted it when i was in high school but i i  i really do like it a lot  so i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i i like some of it um as far as like the country what they now call country western it doesn't sound like the old country music at all does it  um some of it sounds more like pop music
 	
 	
 		no it doesn't it doesn't
 		yeah uh  they've all got you know the real screechy electric guitars now and
 	
 	
 		oh nah i don't care for that if if i'm gonna listen to today's country western i have tapes of like Randy Travis and Clint Black and i even liked Jim Reeves you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh yeah i i grew yeah i grew up on him

 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh Sons of the Pioneers you know stuff like that

 		uh Al Jarreau he's somebody i like he's pretty kind of jazz inspired but but still kind of pop too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i like his he has a nice smooth voice
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and you know what i like the most about him is i've gone to see him in concert and he always he looks like he's having fun
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 	
 	
 		i mean some people sing and they have their faces all contorted like it hurts them or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but he looks like he's having a good time i mean he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and and like all he wants to do is is make the audience enjoy it too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and he he's real fun to listen to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
