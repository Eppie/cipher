 		i'm Bridget
 	
 	
 		hi Bridget i'm Gunner i'm here in Dallas
 	
 	
 		are you i'm in Lubbock
 	
 	
 		oh you are oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i go to school at Tech
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		okay you ready for me to push one
 	
 	
 		yeah sure am
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what do you think about the elderly and their health care
 	
 	
 		well  uh i think there uh you know need to have uh some some means of taking care of them in a in a reasonable and uh uh
 		i guess respectful way
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's uh
 		i guess my biggest problem is that uh they seem to uh be
 		uh be you know put in nursing homes and just forgotten about that's
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's really sad
 	
 	
 		you know
 		have you uh ever spent much time or worked around one or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah i have um my great grandmother was in one and i used to go visit her a lot i think it's sad because one it's so expensive
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		just to put them in there and it's such a traumatic decision anyway
 		and then it's like no one goes and sees them i think that's really sad i mean that i didn't even think about that what i first was thinking about this topic and stuff and that's just that's that's amazes me you know
 	
 	
 		is there uh uh
 		well shoot i guess there's no uh Medicare i don't think pays for it
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so
 	
 	
 		um
 		um i don't know it's just the whole thing is just kind of amazing to me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they need someone to take care of them you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you can kind of see both sides  i mean the people that have to be in one you know should be or people that are just put in one you know that do not need serious you know medical care i think that's kind of sad
 	
 	
 		yeah and a lot of other countries though uh uh you know basically like family takes them
 	
 	
 		yeah that's uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i guess take them for as long as they are you know as long as they live
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		should go back to that
 		think more people should do that
 	
 	
 		well i yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		hard as it may sound or be for some people it's not really that hard
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		least it would be easier
 	
 	
 		especially now that all the you know everybody is getting older and living longer and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's true
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you know it's it's
 		there's going to be more and more  folks
 	
 	
 		yeah there's going to be more older people
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		whether they like to admit it or not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's true though i didn't think about that either people got to think about that
 		and just i just think it's it's kind of sad even knowing if your you know if your parents would even want to go in one or not you know i mean my parents are like no way i know there's no way they would ever want to be put in one
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		and i know that my parents plan to take care of their parents you know if it ever gets to the point where they can't take care of themselves you know they're going to go to Florida or whatever to take care of them
 		that's what they have to do because they don't want to just put them in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they don't think that's right
 	
 	
 		um yeah that is uh that's difficult i tell you
 	
 	
 		i guess it would depend on a lot of things like like financial especially
 		and depending on how old they are and how you know i can see if like my grandmother whose mother used to be in a nursing home she used to go up there and see her every day
 		whose my great-grandmother was in one she used to go see her every day and that is great but when she got sick then you know she can't go see her and stuff and you can't expect so i guess it would depend on how old they were too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because if if the parents if the children were too old to take care of the parents then
 		i don't think that would be very good either
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		hm
 	
 	
 		pretty touchy topic
 	
 	
 		yeah it sure is i know like uh uh lot of places it's like hundred dollars a day
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		at least
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		they're pretty expensive
 	
 	
 		i know but uh
 	
 	
 		but people always figure it as if they had a live in nurse too that's you know just as expensive
 	
 	
 		is it i don't even know
 	
 	
 		it is because i know when my grandmother was looking to put her mother in
 		that is a big ordeal she's like well it's just expensive to have a nurse twenty four hours a day than it is to put her in a a place where at least there's other people you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean and she went and saw her every day like i said and that's good i think because i don't think if you just put them in there and forget about them i don't think that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah really
 	
 	
 		think that's sad
