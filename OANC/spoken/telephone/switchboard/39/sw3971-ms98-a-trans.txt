 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right
 	
 	
 		okay so what do you think of the Giants
 	
 	
 		uh i like the Giants they got uh i probably didn't get into baseball until maybe
 		maybe four three years ago really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh but i i i just like the Giants i don't i don't know why i really got into them i read uh Dave Dreveki's book his autobiography and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah wasn't that something of him
 	
 	
 		yeah that that was incredible
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really a really proud of him though the way he's you know
 	
 	
 		the way he handled that entire situation yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah really you know
 	
 	
 		but
 		i just think the Giants have a good team they they got all you know they're they're real they're real balanced out they got real good pitching and they got the hitting to go along with it so
 	
 	
 		yeah i just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top you know
 	
 	
 		yeah they just they need that i think they just need that one one element to push them over the top you know i don't really know what it is but but every team that's that's really good seems you know like the A's had they had they just had it all that one year so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah um i was mostly an A's fan you know i had been to more games at the A's than i have in the Giants
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh i lived in Oakland you know for some time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i still like the Giants though you know
 	
 	
 		yeah if you if you're a fan you got to stay with your team any way you know you good and the bad but
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's kind of hard i still well
 		basically the the me and all my friends around here since we don't have anywhere i mean we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams but since none me or none of me and my friends are really really like either one of those teams so we uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		about the about the most most baseball we get is either TV or we play it on Nintendo we play RBI baseball on Nintendo so so that's just you know that's small town trying to make it through the
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		through the lull not being around it really but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah right well i prefer baseball uh football over baseball but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah so do i but baseball is still
 	
 	
 		yeah it's
 	
 	
 		you got you got to do something when football ain't on so
 	
 	
 		so add hot dogs baseball and apple pie huh
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly this this is America so
 	
 	
 		yeah um so what do you think's gonna happen this year to the teams
 	
 	
 		uh but
 		uh i don't know it's hard to say i haven't really really you have to just keep up with everything in the off season it's kind of hard to do at least you know you have to read the paper and
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		Sports Illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and and all that but like i say if they can if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the Giants can do it
 	
 	
 		yeah well the Giants yeah
 	
 	
 		they just i don't you i don't really know about the A's i don't like the A's uh matter of fact i can't stand the Oakland A's just because they have that you know they've got their
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Jose Canseco and and all the attitude that goes along with that you know the kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah makes you sick doesn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah you hear what you hear did you hear what he did he ramming his car wife's car and i i was like yeah see that's just
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		
 
 		he's like a little bitty kid huh
 	
 	
 		yeah he's just a a a little boy with a lot of money so that's just you know but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i guess the Giants or might move away from San Francisco it sounds like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i've heard i've heard talk about that
 	
 	
 		you know uh they won't be that far away but
 		San Francisco it'll be hurting anyhow
 	
 	
 		yeah they're not gonna be happy about it
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		but i hope they can do good i mean that's just
 		i think they're a good team that just need that one one little thing to push them over i don't know
 		exactly what it is they got they're pretty balanced out all the way through it just might be the drive you know more than anything else they just they probably just need something to push them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i that's that's the only thing i can see that's holding them back is the ambition to do it or somebody basically maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it
 		maybe that's what you know that's what some teams need
 		look at the Twins going from worst to first so
 	
 	
 		i know isn't that something you couldn't believe that huh
 	
 	
 		yeah my roommate's a my roommate's a Twins fan forever forever so he had his year this year so
 	
 	
 		yeah i just it
 	
 	
 		we we got quite preoccupied we we got into that a whole bunch that was a that was a series to remember for sure
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i saw all seven games of that so that was definitely worth watching
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah i couldn't believe that you know i don't uh there was Braves in that chanting that they have that would drive you up a wall
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they every every every team with the Indians been doing that now and it and it i can't figure out why i've yet to figure out why they're all doing that i'm like it doesn't work it's obvious it doesn't work because the you know the Braves
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you know God
 		yeah well you're right
 	
 	
 		the Braves didn't win so uh why why keep on doing something that didn't work but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i was i was kind of surprised that  we're gonna talk about baseball and i get a woman's voice i was i was i was thinking uh-huh i talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah i got i called got a call the other night about about fixing your automobile up so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		well baseball baseball it's it's kind of i don't know it's kind of odd that they'd do you pick the topic or does the computer
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		no uh they give you a list of things that you want to talk
