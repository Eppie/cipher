 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well are you a fisher person are you
 	
 	
 		yes i love to fish
 	
 	
 		what kind
 		great what kind of fishing do you do
 	
 	
 		well it's mostly from the rivers and lakes
 	
 	
 		in California
 	
 	
 		and yes and from the banks i don't like to go out on boats
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods
 	
 	
 		well it uh down here we usually catch catfish and bass stripped bass you know where i fish and trout up at uh Lake Shasta when i go up there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i like it all except uh really i don't i don't really care that much for the trout i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout
 	
 	
 		well  i i don't blame you
 		i grew up in Nebraska and uh grew up fish cat fishing in the Little Blue River and
 		then uh we moved to uh South Dakota and uh did a lot of walleye fishing on the Missouri River
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh now that we are down here i think a lot of people do some uh bass fishing and striped bass fishing but uh i still uh i am sort of a catfish man at heart
 	
 	
 		i see well uh like in uh Iowa and Nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish huh
 	
 	
 		yep yeah they do
 	
 	
 		you know that's what i mean cause i am from Iowa
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you know we use to catch those little bullheads and that's they look just like baby catfish
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know uh did you get to go fishing very often
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i like to fish the only problem is i just moved to Texas so it's been a little over a year now but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here and i so really i haven't gone fishing for about two years now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's driving me crazy but uh one of these days i will go over to uh Lake Louisville or uh  what is it uh Ray Hubbard Lake Ray Hubbard and
 		get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well uh you like to eat them after you catch them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well yeah sure you bet
 	
 	
 		because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing but they don't like to eat them
 	
 	
 		well most yeah most of the time uh if we catch something we'll take it home and eat it um
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		and you're right i mean i like to fish for trout and they are really uh uh good fighters but uh if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu
 	
 	
 		yeah i know if i go to a restaurant and order fish it's usually either salmon or uh red snapper
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh so do you just uh uh skin your catfish or do you fillet them out how do you how do you
 	
 	
 		we skin skin them yeah yeah yeah just cut their heads off and skin them and then i just uh flour them salt and pepper them and cook them
 	
 	
 		do you okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't put that corn meal on them
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		you know uh
 		that's the way my mother taught me to fry them so
 	
 	
 		well that's how we do it too uh although we uh use to set some uh trout lines out and we've caught you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		fourteen fifteen pound catfish and sometimes those are good to uh do on a barbecue grill
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and just uh leave the skin on and uh do it with uh butter on uh on on tin foil
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then the skin just basically scrapes right off and uh we're and it really tastes pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know i don't think i've ever tried cooking those uh catfish quite that big
 		uh most of them are just the small you know pan frying ones
 	
 	
 		there uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		well i am hoping one of these days i'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on uh a rod and reel but uh so far it's just been on uh on the trout lines so
 	
 	
 		um
 		
  
 		
  
 		wouldn't that be something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's a thrill when you get a big fish though isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh well and up in uh South Dakota on the in the Missouri River there we've uh tied into a few northern pike and uh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		they really uh in in when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish but in the summer time they'll uh give you a run for your money
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so when you were when you did go fishing where did you go you moved there from where Nebraska
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		so it was just like the rivers and uh and the lakes i suppose huh
 	
 	
 		in
 		in Nebraska
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh yeah most of the time uh we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a lot of them ended up being close to the river so if the river ever uh flooded you know then obviously they would dump some catfish and
 		bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we'd do a lot of fishing there too but uh
 		South Dakota didn't really have much for
