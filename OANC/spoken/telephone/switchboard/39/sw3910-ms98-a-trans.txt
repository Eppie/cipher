 
     		
 	
 		how do you uh feel about the metric system
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh i i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think it'd be great that we went to it
 		and uh the the one thing though that i think we should do if we go to the metric system then we should do away with the other system and and have only the metric system
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah i'll tell you i was i was thinking about it while i was waiting for a connection
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i in my business i have to do conversions back and forth between  metric tons and uh then i converted into barrels and gallons and then i deal with long tons and so forth and so on and i will admit that it does make it uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh perhaps a little bit cumbersome at the same time i don't know it's one of the oddities one of the few things that are left you know is is as the world shrinks we become more and more homogenized everybody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems to uh uh  you know it it's like it's like accents even you know there's not used to be there's a great variation across the US and now with television everybody is beginning to sound like uh a news uh announcer you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true you're right you're right there's no losing we're losing our culture of our area uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and the whole um i don't know it
 		yeah but i i don't know i kind of got a soft spot in my uh my heart for feet and inches even though i i like i say in in my business i do have to uh to work around it
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 		yeah well i uh i work in a hospital and of course that's all we use and every and every thing we do is metric you know and uh you know weights is in kilograms and uh you know whatever whatever is whatever happens to be the thing that we're measuring it's in metric
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you know i think one of one of the reasons that i've got some hesitancy about doing it is that i still have a difficult time
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i mean there are few  of pieces of the metric system that i can visualize okay i i i've gotten pretty good at at at you know i realize about that how long a a meter is
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		okay but as far as you know and it's uh i've kind of got the conversion of different parts of the metric system where i'm comfortable with it but i'm not with weights
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and until i i i guess it would be something that if i had been uh uh a little more educated in it or forced into using it more i might be more comfortable with it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah sure right
 		well uh uh one one of the things that really i i really think it would be sort of weird is is the uh cars the miles per hour instead of having uh having kilometers um kilometers per hour
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		cause it it's hard to imagine you know i well i think the problem with us our generation is that nobody even if we did go all the way to the metric system that we're still going to think in terms of how it relates to the other system you know
 	
 	
 		well well sure it'd take a new generation it would take a new generation to be just you know completely metric
 	
 	
 		no matter what you
 		that's right that's right because it's hard to it's just like uh another language i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you're right
 	
 	
 		and when you learn another language um i guess what you have to do is try to think in that language and not think in in terms of translating it to English you know but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well  you know they try to in one of the in one of the parts of the question they ask you know just ask to ask us to discuss was uh uh
 		why why the first attempt failed you know and i was thinking i don't i don't know i i don't really have a good answer for that other than i guess it was just that much uh uh resistance to change
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i think so too and i think that uh that it was it was pretty much optional wasn't it at the time and and uh
 	
 	
 		that's true and and the other thing too they're they were going to use both systems you know simultaneously
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right see that's why i think it is i think they used both systems and everybody as long as they had inches  they could just transpose back and forth and it made it difficult so everybody thought well this is too much trouble
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh of course if you didn't have anything available but metrics i think it'd be a little easier on you you know
 	
 	
 		yeah they didn't until uh  you know uh strawberries by anything but uh kilograms then you know rather than pounds
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right you you'd you would just quit thinking you wouldn't worry about how many ounces is this you would just say well how many how many uh grams is it you know and
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah and then and then you could you know people would start looking seeing a you know a quantity and they would say well hey that you know that's about that looks to be about two pounds and hey that's this much you know in metric so you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure yeah yeah and it's uh like weight you know i i weigh about a hundred and sixty five and that's i know somewhere in the neighborhood of seventy something kilograms you know and it's it's hard to imagine well only seventy something you feel like you don't weigh much you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um i guess if that's the only thing you knew well you would just know well i weigh seventy something kilograms and that's it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah of course i've i do think there's always that there's still kind of a uh  i don't know a a romance if you will with the idea of a yard being the uh the link from the king's nose to the tip of his uh finger or you know
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 		yeah i understand that it's that's true that's very true that's very true
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so i you know  and and that that and i i think i don't know then all these other old English stories that go back you know that with our uh with our system of measurement
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 		
 
 		it's funny that uh i guess all that started in England i guess all the measurement system of measurement and now uh we're still using it and they are gone they've left it you know and they use metrics there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah although although although although there are
