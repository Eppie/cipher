 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um what type of magazines do you have
 	
 	
 		we take several at home i i take um Skiing Magazine and i take uh Discover Magazine and also uh CD and Stereo Review
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and National Geographic i think
 	
 	
 		oh that's a
 	
 	
 		and Boys Life
 	
 	
 		oh good that's a good one i'd like to get  um so i take it that you like to ski do you um do you um
 		receive a lot of information on skiing through the Skiing Magazine
 	
 	
 		i presume that i do uh i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because i do get things from ski associations and things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh at during the year
 	
 	
 		oh uh and do you receive discounts and things like that do you think or
 	
 	
 		uh not so much that i uh more likely to see those at a ski show or something but um  i just enjoy reading about the resorts and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		where you can go and and new equipment that's come out and so forth some fashions are always in there too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		um-hum
 		so with this vacation you're taking did you receive the information from your skiing magazine
 	
 	
 		probably not uh we already knew we wanted to take one and we just started looking around
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i may have referred to a couple of them but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information and picked up a lot of brochures
 	
 	
 		oh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and just decided to go to Crested Butte we hadn't been there before
 	
 	
 		um that sounds nice
 	
 	
 		it's kind of away from the crowd that's why we chose that one it's supposedly low lift lines but i haven't skied Utah yet but i want to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		huh that's
 		oh well you need to come out
 	
 	
 		like to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those i understand Deer Valley is nice too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		Deer Valley uh-huh yeah
 		they are it's wonderful snow
 	
 	
 		well how about you what what magazines do you have at home
 	
 	
 		uh i am currently taking Decorative Woodworking and uh Country Living and let's see we do have National Geographic and then we have some church magazines
 		but i really enjoy the
 		Decorative Woodworking i'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that so the Decorative Woodworking has just been a great great help
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		does it have uh articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh they do have uh mostly they have the the ads on the equipment but the whole magazine is just filled with
 		uh pictures and projects that you can make yourself and then it has all of the patterns and the instructions that you would need to make a wood project and
 		and then how to paint it with the tole paintings and so it's really a fun one i like that
 	
 	
 		well that's good it's good to get use out of one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure that um in the case of National Geographic i mean i read it but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time but then eventually there'll be a school project or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where my son will need to refer back through
 		forty eight back issues to find you know France or something or whatever it is he's looking for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  yeah
 		yes i've i've noticed that too but they have been nice to have around every once in a while they come in handy
 	
 	
 		i used to take Smithsonian too and i liked that magazine but it was i was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it you get so many coming in and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hm oh
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		by the time the next round comes in i'm still not through reading the first round
 	
 	
 		oh that
 	
 	
 		uh because oh Scientific American comes to our house too i forgot that's mostly my son's but he but i do read it too and so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 		well that sounds
 	
 	
 		and he takes Games Magazines too Games Magazine which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that and he likes to to try that and so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he does but  does get to be a lot of paper though after a while  if you don't keep them weeded out they almost take over
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		they do they can do that i found that they've been fun for my little girls they're five and four years old and they like to go through and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they're just kind of getting started now with there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  they like to cut the pictures out and paste them on and so we've found good use for those
 	
 	
 		mine is a senior in high school so he's we're kind of at the end of that trail you're just sort of beginning to think about first grade
 	
 	
 		oh oh uh-huh  yeah it's fun well i do have a boy in junior high too so
 	
 	
 		oh okay so you've got a little bit of a gap there between the little ones
 	
 	
 		so we're kind of running the gamut  yeah but they do it
