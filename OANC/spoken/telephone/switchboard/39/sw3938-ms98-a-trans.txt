 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh  yeah what what have you thought anything about another another car
 	
 	
 		yes i have a nineteen eighty one
 		Volvo station wagon with over a hundred and fifty thousand miles on it
 	
 	
 		it's about time to start thinking isn't it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes and so uh i've actually been looking around and then then things got too busy and it's too complicated out there so
 	
 	
 		isn't it a pain to look for cars i i hate it i really do as a matter of fact i've got my car is uh i have a an eighty seven Lincoln
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i just put it in the shop about oh two weeks ago
 		and just spent about twelve hundred dollars on it i decided to get everything that's wrong with it fixed new brakes new shocks new mufflers and all that because i'm going to keep it till it dies
 	
 	
 		well that that's kind of uh i was the brakes didn't feel like they were working and uh people uh people were saying you know don't you get rid of it every three years and everything and i really was thinking about that then it was like
 		get a loan then you've got to do these you've got to investigate it you've got to check all these things does it have that you you know you can't just go to this dealer you really need to check them all and
 		you can't fall in love with one you've got to be able to turn your back on and then by the time everyone had given me their advice i thought you know this car turns on every morning
 		i think i'll just keep going
 	
 	
 		i know it well and the other thing is too uh it it's just i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the the prices the way the prices have gone up in the past four or five years is uh it just unbelievable
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		right no that's right and and uh the only thing i need is uh i'm not really into cars so i just need something to get me somewhere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i wanted an air bag i thought that would really be a nice thing to have Volvos are safe cars the other thing is i drive all parts of town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and all of sudden the idea of driving in a newish looking car made me much more vulnerable to something happening to it than the car i'm in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i understand that i i do i understand that
 	
 	
 		so so so again i think well now wait a minute besides which i get a more expensive i mean a you know a new car i pay more in taxes uh-huh and insurance
 	
 	
 		insurance insurance yeah and
 		right right well i've i really have uh you know like i say i i feel like i have made a commitment now to drive the car that i've got which you know and and and after i will admit after i had those repairs made on it i felt like you know it felt like it was new again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		like a good car right
 	
 	
 		yeah and i was very pleased with the money i had put into it which is odd that i ever walk away from spending any money on a car that i felt good about but in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that you felt good about yeah
 	
 	
 		but in this particular instance i did because everything felt like they just tightened everything up somehow but uh  but i had decided kind of you know just without really giving it a whole lot of thought
 	
 	
 		yes yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that when i do buy again uh i bought this car that i've got new but probably what i'm going to do sometime in the future is uh i'm going to look around for a good clean used car a year or two old
 	
 	
 		yes that's exactly what they told me they told me too they said you should get it two years because i don't know because the price has come down that much in the two years
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and and uh X number of miles you know or like eleven thousand miles i can't remember i mean people had all these formulas i just felt intimidated so intimidated
 	
 	
 		well and let you know on on note i think anyone you talk with is going to have a different viewpoint on automobiles and really and the other thing is too i i don't think that it what what
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		is true for one person may not necessarily be true for another because other you know so many different people have different needs and and and desires as uh as far as cars are concerned but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just the the kind the i know if i go out to buy a new one i mean i know what kind of money it would take to do it and i just don't want to pay that much money
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  and yeah well the that's my feeling too and eventually they'll be coming out with cars that you know have much better gas mileage or use different kind of gas which is something that matters to me
 		so um if you know if i can keep this one going i mean then uh you know i even considered leasing they talked about leasing i looked into that and then that you know then no it doesn't it makes sense for this kind of thing but not for that
 	
 	
 		yeah i leased one car
 	
 	
 		oh you did
 	
 	
 		yeah i did that one time i had a i got an eighty five or rather it was a uh well it actually started to lease an eighty four and it was a three year lease
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know the only thing about it is i mean it was simple to get into and it really wasn't bad to get out of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you pay that money every month and then you're finished with it and you don't have nothing to show for it granted if you had
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 		you have nothing left yeah
 	
 	
 		spent that money buying one you still wouldn't have much to show for it  but you would have at least a little
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's it you know i i think it depends i i i guess there's certain instances that that could be the best thing to do but i don't think i'll go that route again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well and people told me if you're the kind who buys a new car every two to four years that your
