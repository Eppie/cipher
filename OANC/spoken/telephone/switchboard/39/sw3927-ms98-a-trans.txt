 
     		
 	
 		have any great vacation spots to share with me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh  well most
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm fifty three most of my big vacations i think are probably in the past i've been you know to Europe a couple of times and
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and to
 	
 	
 		where in Europe
 	
 	
 		Rio huh
 	
 	
 		where in Europe did you go
 	
 	
 		oh okay uh England uh Holland France
 		uh one of the interesting most interesting ones was Berlin we were there for five years and this was back in eighty five before you know the wall came down
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so that was very interesting to go into
 		you know a Communist country and all that course it's kind of laughable now but you know that's the way it was then
 	
 	
 		that's not
 		you say you were there for five years
 	
 	
 		five days i'm
 	
 	
 		oh five days uh-huh
 	
 	
 		five days
 		my husband's brother was the commander of the Air Force base in Berlin
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so we were visiting them
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry i interrupted you you was always saying also saying that you'd gone to Rio
 	
 	
 		yeah uh another brother  all my  my brothers and sisters used to live in all these interesting places uh they're all retired and back in the states now but one lived in Rio and that was
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		we went there for about ten days and that was quite a beautiful place
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so
 	
 	
 		so a lot lot of your big vacations have been international
 	
 	
 		to
 		yeah and to visit relatives my brother worked lived in Jamaica for a number of years so we went there you know for a week so uh
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		do you like to travel domestically as well do you do you take vacations around the country now
 	
 	
 		uh yes uh-huh in fact that's probably where we'll go in the remaining years we'll probably just stay right here in this country for some we i think we could afford more back then than we can now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we're caught in this economic crunch
 	
 	
 		yes i can relate to that
 	
 	
 		we also had a time share condo if you're familiar with those so we used and it was our home unit was in Vail Colorado
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and then if you didn't want to go there you could switch and go actually anywhere anywhere in the world and
 	
 	
 		did you ski when you were there
 		in Vail
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah a little but we waited we were too old when we started going to really learn the you know like our children learned well and skied well but you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you that's something you really i think should learn when you're younger
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know you wait until you're forty five and start learning to ski well then you're afraid you're going to break something
 	
 	
 		it's true it's true
 	
 	
 		now i've done all the talking you tell me what you've done
 	
 	
 		yours are much more exciting than mine um i think probably finances have limited us um primarily my family um
 		because i'm the oldest when i left
 		um my family went on some really fun vacations so it's more the things that i've done with my husband and and more recently our child that uh
 		that we that i could probably talk about
 	
 	
 		well you're much younger what age are you
 	
 	
 		well i'm not actually i just started my family younger  i mean started my family later um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i'm thirty six and my daughter's only
 	
 	
 		well that is young go ahead
 	
 	
 		my
 		well but my daughter's only two so  at my age i think that my my mother
 		i mean when my mother was my age i think that i was probably twelve or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah but but that was the trend back then you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you had your children in the early twenties
 	
 	
 		it
 		right
 		at any rate we've really enjoyed camping vacations i think that that's probably the thing that we've uh done most each year probably four to seven times a year we'll take short short little vacations maybe three days maybe four days
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and there's so many places in the San Francisco Bay area that you can camp that you don't really have to go very far you can drive as little as an hour and get into a redwood forest and feel like you're just
 	
 	
 		oh and such beautiful country up around you
 	
 	
 		it is really nice to have that very close
 		um there are some places up the coast near Mendocino and in Marin that have what they call environmental cabins so
 		you can rent them fairly inexpensively and stay a couple nights and feel like you have a little beach house getaway
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so we've done that a few times too you know it's very rustic you don't you bring all your own things and you bring your your your cooler almost as if you were camping but there's a stove and there's a
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		a table and and uh platforms for your bed mattress and that sort of thing so it's somewhat set up
 		those we've really enjoyed i think what i'd like to do when our daughter's a little older
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and if we have other kids its uh the kind of club made med vacations that my husband and i enjoyed several years ago because there's so many different activities
 	
 	
 		um-hum and and they you can take children now can't you
 	
 	
 		yes they call them club kids
 	
 	
 		yeah okay i knew i knew something about that uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes they have all kinds of art activities and sports that are tailored for kids and babysitters if you have children that are you know infants
