 
     		
 	
 		that's it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		what do you think are possible changes in the uh the way trials are conducted these days do you like the way some people in there for instance really take over and uh
 		we have no way of knowing whether they're legitimately right or wrong so forth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what do you think about these things
 	
 	
 		well as i look at our trial systems i think they've gotten to be quite a joke the way that people can appeal and file for mistrials and they've taken a lot of the things that that were set up to make it be a fair system
 		and used it to their advantage
 		i think that a jury should listen to the court
 		uh to to the hearings and to everything but i think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision
 		i think the judge should hold the fifty or maybe even forty nine and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other
 	
 	
 		you you're so you're saying you you think the judge should actually have the final say
 	
 	
 		i think he should and i think that there should be more than one judge there should be maybe two
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		at least that sit in and listen so that there's no way that you could have
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		like a crooked judge do you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		yes i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		um and i think that there it's important to have a jury
 		but i think the way that they go through so much time to get a a fair one that's okay too as long as it's not used to delay the trial so much
 		they need to have a fair jury but they only would you know would cover
 		fifty forty nine percent of the decision or fifty percent and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		how do you feel about that
 	
 	
 		i hadn't uh thought of it from that point of view before i have been in a fairly important trial
 		and uh what bothers me is
 		i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and uh accurate decision
 		that's the part that bothered me about it
 		um i really think that the the the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they're guilty or not but i also think that the jury should be
 		uh very very uh carefully more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intelligent intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accurate accurate decisions
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and don't know much about any of this stuff and
 		and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time that's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem
 	
 	
 		right
 		right well what if they used you know i just had a thought come as you were talking what if they used law students
 		and had that be credit hours to sit in trials
 	
 	
 		that would be certainly nice shit let's say we we would have fifty percent of them law students at any rate yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah at least at least on the jury and that would give them experience in the courtroom and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		that's a very neat idea and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right that would be a really good thing to do
 	
 	
 		that would be a a really good thing to do
 	
 	
 		i i have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial
 	
 	
 		so that's
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and what happened was her husband was um
 		involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stop light and ran into the motorcycle
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but the reason the actual reason that the motorcycle person her husband was killed was because his brakes
 		went out on his motorcycle he was just taking it home from the place it was brand new and his brakes did not work
 	
 	
 		for goodness sakes
 	
 	
 		and this expensive big company that owned these motorcycles
 		um railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they were following him home in the car saw the whole thing happen
 	
 	
 		oh they saw the husband get
 	
 	
 		that's right they were following him home from the motorcycle shop
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials um this and that and the other every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of a of a settlement
 	
 	
 		they'd find something wrong with it
 	
 	
 		until finally they won and said that it was the drunk driver's fault and she would have to sue him
 	
 	
 		did they really
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which i would think it would be some his fault but i just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money the big lawyers and she didn't
 	
 	
 		that is a shame you'd think there would be enough uh people who saw the accident other than his wife
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to to also uh make statements and they have nothing to gain one way or the other so if they say a certain way then why not believe them
 	
 	
 		right and i don't know all the details on that but i certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the
 		the student the students coming into the jury
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say
 	
 	
 		um-hum
