 
     		
 	
 		afternoon Doug it certainly is uh going to be a pleasure to chat with you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm uh certainly was surprised to uh to hear from you normally i talk to people in Plano Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah me too
 	
 	
 		how did you get on this list
 	
 	
 		uh through Nancy Dalgren she um
 		she had somehow gotten the information from TI and was distributing it around
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		all righty well now what would you say about these everyday
 		invasions of our privacy do what ideas do you have on that Doug
 	
 	
 		um see i'm not sure that
 		i don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country but i think that the opportunity is definitely there for um
 		people to invade your privacy when they want to i think it's um
 	
 	
 		in what in what manner
 	
 	
 		well it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone it's completely trivial to for instance
 		listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone since they're just radio signals  it's um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		let's see
 		well what's the first thing that comes to your mind
 	
 	
 		well the thing that i thought they were uh concerned about was was people calling calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other
 		organizations and i thought that was uh beginning to invade the privacy of people because
 		the things about where you live and and maybe what you purchased in
 		past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business and they in return come back and try to sell you something with this uh
 		additional knowledge to me that's an invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree with you there for sure
 		um
 		and i think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get you know it's possible for
 		almost anyone to get information about your credit history for instance if they just um
 		twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's you know possible for a thirteen year old
 		hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history not to mention change it if he wants to
 	
 	
 		you mean your history in regards to uh the charge card company or something like that
 	
 	
 		well um
 		well yes well for instance yes um and they'll probably goes into
 		other things like you know your records with
 		the government or utility companies or anything
 	
 	
 		do you consider these serious uh problems
 	
 	
 		since
 		um uh not
 		not yet anyways because i don't think they're widespread enough but i think they have the potential of becoming serious problems
 	
 	
 		um-hum well what should we do about it or what could be done about it do you think to correct it
 	
 	
 		um i'm not really sure because
 		the
 		i mean society is going more and more electronic and there are certainly benefits to its doing so
 		and it's hard to hard to say whether the um risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not
 		and i'm not sure
 		what can be done to ensure that they don't um
 		uh why do you see any out for us
 	
 	
 		well i would think that uh information held on records uh by any company or charge card dealer or or person should be absolutely private private and
 		and not be allowed to be uh to given out by those companies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean it it should be made a a uh national or a state law to protect people so that uh you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in other words if you call the company yourself directly uh and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else uh you know from the outside so to speak then you'd
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you'd feel more free to uh to go into detail with them
 	
 	
 		yeah i suppose
 	
 	
 		but but we have no control of that now and then uh you you're when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you you feel that it someday might be used against you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
