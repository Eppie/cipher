 		all right ah what kind of music do you like
 	
 	
 		um i listen to all sorts of music really i think uh i like a lot of country
 	
 	
 		oh yeah is that really popular in Texas or is that just like a stereotype because it's the south
 	
 	
 		um
 		i think it's pretty popular  i mean it is probably like a huge stereotype but i think it's pretty popular too what kind of music do you like
 	
 	
 		is it
 		oh
 		um well i used to not really like country that much but i think but what my dad really likes it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i used to listen to that and the older i got the more it you know i i can listen to it but um i prefer um  um hm groups like i like um Firehouse
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and Slaughter  and um Scorpions um the Scorpions
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so you like more hard rock yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but i also like the top forty too and i really like the oldies station like um fifties music
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and and um The Doors are pretty good too i can listen to them and The Who i i really like all kinds i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's how i am too do you like any rap music
 	
 	
 		um no that's about the only kind i don't get into is like rap and like classical and um
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't either
 	
 	
 		jazz is all right but um like the blues and stuff like that i i like to dance and if it's like a upbeat you know good song then then i'll listen to it and if i'm out you know dancing then makes it better to listen to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so you like mostly like uh do you like hard rock the best
 	
 	
 		yeah um there's this station called The Blaze from Chicago and that's my favorite  because they yeah they play um all different kinds of um harder rock
 	
 	
 		really
 		uh-huh well i'm from Dallas and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh i've been there hm um-hum
 	
 	
 		have you they have hard rock stations there i don't even think they have a hard rock station in Lubbock i pretty sure they don't if they if they do i've never come across it
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		no
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but they only have i mean they don't have really it's really small and uh  they don't have that really many radio you know like top forty stations even
 	
 	
 		oh really uh oh yeah oh that's neat uh-huh me too  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it's more like a college town so yeah because i'm in college
 		
 
 		cool so um i mean i  don't think gah they had a i don't think they do have a hard rock station here
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		see you don't here very often and you  never have like bands come you never have them like come up to we're up here you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really we get a lot like at the bars because um we have a lot of like bands that form by themselves like from Milwaukee and Chicago trying to get started you know to the big top and yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		see that's great you would never see that here no i don't think you would
 	
 	
 		oh really uh-huh
 		i think a lot of music has to do with like you know the type of people you hang around with and especially your environment like you know the settings like the bigger cities you get more variety i think you know
 	
 	
 		yeah see yeah see i think most people listen to country up here being it's so far like in the panhandle of Texas and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh i've gotten to like um a couple of songs from Garth Brooks
 	
 	
 		do you i know he's great i like him a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah i i just um heard of him this year my boyfriend um he uh likes some types of country music and he was listening to that and it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		see i only know very few too even i mean i only know like Garth Brooks and like George Straight and a few of the top the really good guys i like Garth Brooks i really like him he's really good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah i i've liked most the songs i heard so that was good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you have to kind of get used to it though because i didn't like country western really for a while and even when i came up here i didn't listen to it until like last year then i started listening to it a lot and then then you like it a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah same here
 		oh yeah
 		uh i just started um listening to it too because my boyfriend but yeah after i heard it a while at first i didn't like it and then i heard it and then i'm like oh this isn't so bad you know it's it's
 		you know upbeat and
 		you know i got into it and i saw on TV one time um they were playing Garth Brooks and they were um showing how to country dance to it and it looked so fun because like i say i like to dance and it was just really neat
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah you would like two stepping then
 	
 	
 		yeah it it looked fun i'm like oh i wanna learn now
 	
 	
 		i know i wanted to i wanna learn to because we can do it but we're not very good
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		we're just like oh yeah we kind of fake it you know so i wanna take lessons because i think that'd be so fun i think
 	
 	
 		oh
