 
     		
 	
 		okay Janet do you guys have a family budget
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we try to  like mothers i'm sitting i'm right this minute dishing up cheap spaghetti which is one way we try and keep within a budget
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		it's probably why we're participating too right
 	
 	
 		although i'm trying to raise money for a boy scout cause
 		um actually how we do it is my husband and i both work and we try very hard to live on his salary and my salary goes automatically into a savings
 		account which we try not to use too much although from that we both definitely we typically pay our credit cards from that account
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that's the that's the uh our household expenses are pretty well covered because they're pretty much the same every month
 		but it's our credit card spending that it's always the problem
 	
 	
 		yep is the cost of living uh high down there is it tough to
 	
 	
 		i don't know what to compare it to i lived in Indiana and Saint Louis but i was a student then and you know when you're a student things don't mean much um i think Dallas is um
 	
 	
 		i know it's just a
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		relatively high priced homes but then there's not
 		i think energy and some of the other things aren't quite so high
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i my my gestalt is that our groceries are sort of intermediate there're not as bad as i have seen in big cities like New York or California areas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		um the cost of living here is cheap in in fact it's really great we've got a
 		a quite a nice home we've got a five bedroom home home with a basement in it and it cost me through let me see four years ago it cost me fifty five thousand
 		so it's great i mean uh uh
 	
 	
 		that is
 		where are you from originally
 	
 	
 		right here in Idaho
 	
 	
 		from from Idaho
 	
 	
 		yes i've got a brother in law in Plano Texas and that's how we got hooked up with this uh TI deal but it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i don't know anyone from Idaho i'm from Indiana um and i have a great love for the Midwest
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		would go back in a minute if i could but i married a Texan
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they don't always tell you that they have a homing instinct
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i our home uh we have a five bedroom home um but it's more in the range of with around two hundred forty thousand
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so about four and a half times your home i'm sure they're probably quite comparable
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or maybe i don't know ours is nice our home is nicely located but i don't think the house itself is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well i i wouldn't uh mine's not nicely located i probably got a bargain i think more
 	
 	
 		particularly extraordinary
 		how about budget wise how how do you do a family budget are you married
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes i am and my wife is very meticulous about budgeting she has a computer program in fact i'm an accountant i'm a CPA
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm calling you from work tonight uh but uh my wife runs every single check she spends through a computer
 		and she can tell me on a monthly basis and she's more interested not me in fact i only look at it once a year when i do our we do our taxes
 		but she can tell you every month exactly what she's paid for groceries and uh utility bills and for gasoline in the cars and everything she's uh
 	
 	
 		uh my husband tries very hard to do that for us and we used the Managing Your Money software package with Andrew Tobias he is familiar with that one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 		yeah i'm not i'm not uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well i mean now i'm sure there are a million software packages but um he tried very hard and we were all computerized and we
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		our regular monthly checks we printed you know um and i hated i did it for three years and hated every minute of it  and still founded about half of our checks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		huh
 	
 	
 		maybe a third i still hand wrote because it would be like in the school parking lot or
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yep
 	
 	
 		you know at my child's skating lesson or something like that so we had to come we had two checks two sizes of checks
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 		excuse me  Beth right there
 		my daughter wants to know where the spaghetti cheese is um so we we tried and it was pretty nice one of one mistake i think we made in that is that um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		for budgeting purposes in terms of putting it in a budget we must have had eighty different categories and so they they became sort of nonsensical instead of i always said if we had redone it we should have just put big categories like utilities
 	
 	
 		yep
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know luxuries and entertainment that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we have about twenty five categories is all probably and we write all of our checks out of the register we don't try to do any through the computer and then my wife just sets down when she's got about an hour and just keys them all in
 		and it's really not you know that bad it um
 		well i don't know it might it might've been tough for you but she enjoys it and that's another thing too she really enjoys it
 		she uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well i see  i suppose that's the key um
 	
 	
 		just gets a thrill out of seeing where her money went i guess
 	
 	
 		do you does your wife work outside the home
 	
 	
 		she does she's she teaches at um a small two year college here she's uh teaches uh business communications
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness well with a CPA and a business person you should be organized
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh yeah uh i don't know no we still have problems with money like everybody else
 	
 	
 		yeah
