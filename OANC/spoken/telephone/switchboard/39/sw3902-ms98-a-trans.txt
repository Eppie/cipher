 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well why don't you start because it said i was suppose to ask you what do you
 	
 	
 		do you have any elderly relatives currently in uh in a nursing home now
 	
 	
 		yes i do
 	
 	
 		do you i have a grandmother she's a hundred and two
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		she'll be a hundred and three in August
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we decided not to put her in a nursing home
 		she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town and then my sister takes care of her
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		she still has her snap she takes care of her own business this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker
 		but with somebody that needs around the clock care i have seen my family age
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i've seen them in the she's been there ten years now and i have seen them age twenty in the time and and with the expense and everything i think i still think it is worth it if you if you had a good nursing home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they needed some quality care i would put someone in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		right
 		my mother-in-law finally they had to make a family decision there's seven children in my husband's family and fortunately four of them live in the same home town
 		and she has Alzheimer's it was getting where she was
 		getting things dangerous i mean letting strangers in and things like this but they were very fortunate it's a small town and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time but she really doesn't nobody thought she would adjust but she's adjusted beautifully
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good
 		oh that is great
 	
 	
 		but then i am also facing my father who is very sick and my mother and father reside in Colorado she's been taking care of him i don't know how much longer this can last
 		and at that point because he requires round the clock he can't do anything without her he doesn't know when to take his medicine
 		and it's really sad and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for
 		uh my brother's are not interested in helping me so i would have to move him down here that way i want to see the nursing home if i have to put him into one
 		you know where i can go see it i i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado
 		and
 	
 	
 		why yeah i'm sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas
 	
 	
 		yes and some of them are limited care too where people can do uh like they have apartment styles but that wouldn't work for him i think he's beyond that
 		where if you need help you can get it but basically people kind of have a small apartment and doctor's are available if they need them and allows
 	
 	
 		um-hum i i i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in Austin
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive of course i guess all nursing homes there is
 	
 	
 		where
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have we have to be a pauper
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it it takes every penny they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care and that's the sad part about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah i see uh yeah and i think a lot of people who do it now in Colorado it's interesting i talked to my mother they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home
 		and my mother could make it on that what she probably would do is disburse the money to me and then i would send it back to her so that's probably what would happen
 	
 	
 		um-hum i think that's what most people do you just have to give it everything away
 	
 	
 		yeah it's unfortunate
 	
 	
 		i i i work at a brokerage firm and i have seen so many people that just have to gift
 		you know their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah it's frightening and i guess uh i don't know how old you are i'm forty six you know we're the generation moving into this and i don't know how our kids are gonna take care of us
 	
 	
 		i can't imagine i'm twenty nine and everybody in my family's always had we don't have any children everybody that has has them later in life so my my mother and my father are in their late sixties
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i mean they're not  that far away
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		i also fill in my generation a squeeze between
 		looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise and he's still living at home and i don't know how he's ever going to get on his own the way things are
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		and so it's kind of squeezed you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother
 		i uh you know i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay
 	
 	
 		it but yeah most people aren't
 	
 	
 		but you see these people in their seventies yeah most aren't that's the problem
 	
 	
 		and that's the bad thing i would hate to have lived so long she lived by herself
 		my grandfather passed away before i was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety ninety one
 	
 	
 		that's incredible
 	
 	
 		and just did everything and it but most people aren't like
