 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		alright
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay um so what kind of uh uh piece of property have you got
 	
 	
 		we've got a home and uh very large front and back yard we had a lot of Dallas grass what they call Dallas Dallas grass
 		and others  parts of country call Crab grass that real thick grass and we had a problem with that but we've seemed to've taken care of it how about you
 	
 	
 		um um-hum um-hum
 		well um i um
 		up here we don't have too much trouble with Crab grass or anything like that um
 		uh we've uh like we rent the house that we live in but we've got a pretty large piece of uh land that we live on even though very close into Washington DC
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so most of the work that we have to do involves mowing the lawn and um uh uh my sweetheart who i live with uh does a lot of uh flower gardening and stuff around the house she gets a lot of pleasure from that
 	
 	
 		what flowers does she like
 	
 	
 		hm um well it changes from year to year and she's thinking this year she's gonna get into bulbs and that sort of thing but most of the sorts of things that she
 		uh has grown in the past have been um
 		i guess wild flowers and uh some stuff that our neighbors sort of brings over periodically she's also she likes things like Hollyhocks and uh Peonies and and uh
 		oh let's what else has she got oh the other things she's really into is Morning Glories and uh in the summer time we have Morning Glories just all over the house it's great all different colors
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah they climb too
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's a lot of fun it's real pleasant in fact our next door neighbor in Christmas time this year couldn't resist giving us a set of coffee cups had Morning Glories all over them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh she she found them and she said oh i just had to buy them for you but uh we're also really into vegetable gardening
 	
 	
 		do you have a problem with any type of uh insects or gophers or anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		actually yeah actually we do we we don't have any um any uh you know varmints or anything like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that that tend to bother the garden but we do have a lot of trouble with insects particularly caterpillars um we've had very very poor luck with uh all of the core crops and like um uh
 		and cabbage and and uh broccoli and  cauliflower and that sort of
 	
 	
 		if you uh sprinkle lime on your young plants before they get too big that should help that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that's um exactly what we've done and you're you're advice is is dead on in in our experience in fact uh thing that we've found works even better than lime is diatomaceous earth
 	
 	
 		yeah that works that's kind of hard to get a hold of sometimes
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah well um
 		Jackie got a hold of a huge box of it so much of it that i dare say that we'll probably still using be using it five years from now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she went out to some uh pool supply place and and got this huge box of it and it's really it's big
 		and she came home with it and she was real proud and she said okay well we've got a lifetime supply now so we've got no excuse and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what vegetables do you grow the most
 	
 	
 		well we uh have uh i guess in the last two or three years really discovered that we're really fond of hot peppers and so um
 		we grow tomatoes down one side of the house where we get a lot of sun and then in our regular garden plot this past uh couple of years we've grown a lot of different varieties of hot peppers
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you have jalapenos
 	
 	
 		uh yes which of course are our favorites and uh but we've also grown a lot of real um uh hot uh smaller varieties like Tais and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		do you have the small red ones cayenne
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah yeah the cayennes and we've even grown some little funny uh uh peppers and i've never i've never been sure one of them i believe is called Chili Tepid and the other one is called Pequine and um
 		they're they're little tiny hot things that we she takes them inside and she dries them and then we eat and
 	
 	
 		i've heard of the Chili but i've never heard of the Pequine what are they are they green red and yellow what
 	
 	
 		they're little green
 		literally pea size peppers they're they're just little tiny guys and they dry up even smaller than they are when they're they're you know fresh food on the um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the plant but the plants are just incredibly prodigious they just produce zillions of them um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what do you use them for mainly
 	
 	
 		uh all kinds of dishes we like i say we grind them up and um we freeze some of them and then use them in stews and uh whenever we make egg dishes or anything like that we tend to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to put some on it it's just incredible with the numbers of ways that we come up to use them
 		and uh it's it's funny i mean we were laughing at ourselves one night because we uh we realized that um we had uh  we were having it with every meal
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but anyway it it's uh it's something that we enjoy immensely and it we get a lot of pleasure out of i love tilling up the garden every year and um uh you know getting out there and just spending some
