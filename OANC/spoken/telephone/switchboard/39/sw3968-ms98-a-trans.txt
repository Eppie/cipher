 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right that's a real different topic i'm not sure i'm familiar with
 		with what they mean of invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		i know i guess that
 		i guess you consider just things that every day that would you'd think of about see i'm a college student so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that i think's like is an invasion of my privacy stuff like that but i think it'd be it is kind of a tough topic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think personally you know i'm i'm i used to be a college student ten years ago but  uh now i think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and says Mrs Miller have we got a deal for you
 	
 	
 		oh gosh you're like no you don't no
 	
 	
 		it's like how do you know my name where did you get my phone number and why do you think it's a deal for me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean those people they'll call you any time of the day or night with try to solicit and that's an invasion of my privacy i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they call late now i mean now there's i heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or something
 	
 	
 		oh they do already
 	
 	
 		see that's ridiculous i would be so mad
 	
 	
 		well and i've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays too
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		don't answer your phone hello the computer's geared to to start talking to you on the on the word hello
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really huh i don't know i'd think like things that that i think's like privacy is like just like not going through my stuff but like going through just like my clothes or my drawer just going through my stuff basically
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		oh yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that drives me up a wall
 	
 	
 		are you and your roommate a similar size
 	
 	
 		no see we're not and uh
 	
 	
 		and she still goes through your clothes
 	
 	
 		yeah she'll take all my shirts and stuff because she can't wear like my pants but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		man i'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but still she'll just take them and she won't even think about it and then i'll like see her that day and she'll be wearing my clothes and i'll be like you know i don't like to borrow my clothes out you know i really don't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i prefer that you just not go in and get them because she doesn't even ask me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		stuff like that really  like that's an invasion of my privacy i feel like
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		stuff like that when you have your door closed people just walking in and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i was thinking like my mom i know this she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy is like going through her purse like if you ever needed money and stuff we always just give her her purse you know and she'll get it out or whatever
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i was trying to think i was thinking that's the only thing i could really think of that would really be
 	
 	
 		my mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i mean we're all grown all her kids are grown and we have our own families and now if we go through her cabinets she's like well what are you digging for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah get out of my cabinets
 	
 	
 		yeah like what are you doing don't you have your own house to dig through
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 		i guess that privacy is really
 		and at the work place i suppose oh well actually yes i can say definitely privacy at the work place i hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		see
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because that was that was where i kept all my stuff and i could tell i mean even if a pen was turned the wrong way oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you could tell you know you put your stuff where it's yeah
 		that would drive that would that
 	
 	
 		it would drive it drove me batty for a while yeah well i worked a second shift
 	
 	
 		really
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and everybody else in my area worked first shift and our shifts overlapped
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i would come in and there would be people sitting at my desk working
 		and i'm wondering you know um
 		what is this  it's my vitamins
 		i wonder what is you know yeah what is why are they working at my desk and can i have it back
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		can i have it back soon maybe
 	
 	
 		then you start missing stuff and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  no mommy is going to take the vitamins
 		i'm sorry i have a small person
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see that would that would make me really mad because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff just because i mean i know i have everything like a certain way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		switchboard call
 	
 	
 		and you know how it looks and everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah well you know how you left it the day before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that would bother me definitely
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		so that's
 		
 
 		yeah i agree it's it's pretty tough that way
 		and
 		i know even like with your school books and paper
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		do you miss your papers sometimes
 	
 	
 		see yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  huh
 	
 	
 		you just know that's the only thing i can really think about being an invasion of privacy like something every day though
 	
 	
 		yeah well actually i do know and i have used it once and it it really is an invasion of privacy but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live by their street address yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that i mean i've i've used it once
