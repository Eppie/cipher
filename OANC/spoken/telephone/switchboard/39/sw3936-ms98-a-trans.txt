 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		have you snow had any snow up your way
 	
 	
 		no we haven't had any since uh oh just before Christmas
 		and uh we got a lot before Christmas the ski resorts were really excited and uh but now uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		we have we've had fog for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion so but no uh no snow
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		the snow's all melted off the mountains uh
 	
 	
 		well i talked to a woman who lived up in the hills uh mountains in uh Utah uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		guess this last weekend and she had uh quite a bit of snow on the ground her way
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i guess there there's different parts of the state of Utah that that that does have some but uh not usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts and they're down between thirty eight and uh
 		forty inches
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		this time of the year and uh we've been in a drought for the last five years this is the sixth year
 		and it's getting quite serious as far as water next summer
 	
 	
 		yeah well the weather uh here is always a topic of conversation in Texas
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		we have wide variations and have
 		warm weather when most people have cold weather but we have our share of cold weather as well the uh temperature this morning was right at freezing it didn't stay there but it was
 	
 	
 		oh well that's that's different isn't it
 	
 	
 		right at
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		we usually have some of our coldest weather toward the uh
 		end of January but this year it wasn't bad at all i guess that's because we had so much rain
 	
 	
 		i know my son was telling me about the rain down there he said yeah well it just  and we read in the newspaper southern part of Texas i guess
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		flooded out
 	
 	
 		well my uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my sister lives in Houston and they uh
 		the river there was uh in the flooding stage near where her son lives and that uh
 		caused some uh concern of course
 		they have a uh lake cabin and uh their dock was completely under water on the lake
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so we really had a lot of rain
 	
 	
 		yeah my son in Plano he lives fairly close to there's quite a wash that goes down uh through Plano
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh there's walking trails on both sides a walking path and uh when i've gone down to visit him i've gone on that but uh that was clear full and up to up to some of the streets i guess it just gets
 	
 	
 		yeah we had a lot of flash floods in the area we had a few people who ran into uh
 		water and a few fatalities just uh just uh a few not more than ten
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's funny that uh we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		seems like
 	
 	
 		well the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there's an old profane
 		expression about Texas weather it's always too damn cold too damn hot too damn windy
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's uh interesting uh i'm going down to El Paso next week
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh i was wondering what the weather was but i imagine that if it's that cold in Dallas it
 	
 	
 		well El Paso won't be cold
 	
 	
 		it's not a doesn't get that cold i guess huh
 	
 	
 		no it's it's quite southern and it's it's rare to get real cold in in El Paso
 		the uh
 		you'll be flying in there
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well uh take off is uh fun from El Paso because you normally the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain the Rockies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and they're towering above you and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah we're kind of used to that here in Utah of course there are mountains and i fly into Montana a lot and we have a
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the mountains are are really uh high and a lot of places we go into you just kind of uh it's in the little valley but
 		and i uh sure hope we we really need the moisture i hope we can get uh get some there's supposed to be a storm but it split went down through uh northern Arizona and southern Utah and
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		they're not predicting any for the next uh week anyway up here so
 	
 	
 		well i noticed on the weather map on uh cable network that
 		there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way but i guess it didn't pan out huh
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's that's what the  went above uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana so that just left us we got a high pressure
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		system that's just been sitting in here and uh we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had uh you know airport's been shut down uh till about noon everyday and they they seed the clouds or seed the fog to try to
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to get the airplanes in and out
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well we uh had a bad siege last uh Christmas a year ago we went up to visit my wife's uh
 		sister who lives in uh Calgary Alberta Canada
 	
 	
 		um-hum
