 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm Bridget
 	
 	
 		hello
 		my name's Dan
 	
 	
 		it's nice to meet you are you ready for me to push one
 	
 	
 		nice to meet you
 		i think so
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 		okay do you have any kids
 	
 	
 		uh no uh luckily i don't i just rent them
 	
 	
 		you do
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm a i'm an assistant scout master for a boy scout troop
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah it's
 		it's it's it's so much better to to rent
 	
 	
 		a little easier
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well what would you think if they were going off to college
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		that's uh let's see i i used to be able to do this quite well but that was when i was in college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah the college that i've got that that i went to was pretty good which was Cal Poly in Pomona
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh  you know it was a regular it was a state university and it seemed to be pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah because i'm in college right now i thought God this is a good question
 	
 	
 		oh really which one
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was like because i i know how my parents when i was looking at colleges
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they didn't really say anything i mean they didn't say you know i want you to go here or you know they left it up to me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i thought it was real interesting because i picked where i wanted to go and then afterwards my mom was like oh i really kind of wish you would have gone there and i didn't even know that she'd even you know liked another place or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		but i don't think parents could make that decision for you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well my my parents wanted me to go to uh community college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i ended up  getting into the university and they never really said anything about it until
 		uh my sisters went to college and they they went to the community college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my parents my father's going jeez it it it uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		costs a lot more or just as much to go to community college and you aren't getting as much you know so
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because i know people
 		i know some of my friends whose parents really wanted them to go somewhere so they did and they hate it you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		or that they don't do good and they fail out and it's like because i know one person
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um his parents wanted him to go to SMU really bad
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he went and he doesn't like it i mean he wouldn't admit to you that he doesn't like it but it you know he's not doing good and he never is excited about it or anything and he won't tell his parents i was like well why don't you transfer you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well because his parents gave him the car to go there  well you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i really the car wouldn't get it because i just think that's sad i don't think parents can can make that decision for you i you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you if they let i think you should choose and you know work something out between y'all God
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's that's the way colleges are right now anyway is they they have a bunch of kids come down they say hey you wanna be here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah oh i know
 	
 	
 		it's it's so it's pointed towards you
 	
 	
 		yeah see
 	
 	
 		and if they sell you well enough there ain't nothing that's going to change your mind
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right that's definitely true
 	
 	
 		we're consumers in society
 	
 	
 		yeah sad as long as i just think as long as people are happy so many people will go some place and transfer or whatever
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's like you got to find where you fit in best
 	
 	
 		yeah you got to
 		got to find the good classes and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah really i know i have some hard classes now that i'm just like uh
 	
 	
 		i i well i can imagine that i i started off the the counselor at high school said oh you wanna do this well then go into aerospace aerospace
 	
 	
 		stuff like that
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i went and my first day of enrollment in college i walked around i go into the aerospace building they give me the curriculum and it's like twenty one units to twenty four units a quarter
 	
 	
 		uh and you're like uh i don't think i want to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah and average is like you know it's supposed to be like sixteen eighteen you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know this is like i don't want to be a doctor
 	
 	
 		yeah you're like i i really didn't want to do it i was just kidding you know i just  thought i'd come try it out
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah i happened to be walking down the hall turned into some some other instructor's office and said help me  and he sold me on his program
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 		yeah you can't have someone can't choose that for you that's why i think people people i know that stay in school so long it's because they can't figure out what they wanna do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like what you know and they start with one major and they go through the certain you know classes you have to take for that major then they change their mind
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's like oh you got to start all over because you lose all the classes you just took  that's crazy that's like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they need to hire someone to help you and everyone should have to take like a test or something of what you might want to do because i think that's so sad because people
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well they there there's some tests like that now but they're kind of strange some of them you know it's like you you you should be a cement mixer or something like that you know
 	
 	
 		yeah there are
 		yeah
 		yeah i know yeah i know they have better ones yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and the guy walked in going yeah but i wanted to be a psychologist
 	
 	
 		yeah you're going you should be a farmer you're like a farmer what
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i know we took those in like high school those are stupid
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they ought to tell you mine is psychology
 	
 	
 		what's what's your major
