 
     		
 	
 		what kind of camping do you do down there
 	
 	
 		well we have gone to several places
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um there's a real nice area north of here close to the Oklahoma border
 	
 	
 		do you
 		do you have a camp trailer or do you just take tents and sleeping bags um-hum
 	
 	
 		no we take tents
 		tents and sleeping bags
 		is what we use
 	
 	
 		take the whole family
 	
 	
 		yeah we do uh we haven't gone in a while because we have a three year old and we're waiting for her to get a little bit older but we have two older kids and we take them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it's fun
 		i mean we're not avid campers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um
 		i guess our the funnest camping trip we had was was when we went up north
 		close to the Oklahoma border that's north to me  um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we stayed for about three or four days and the weather was very nice that's one thing you have to consider down here because in the summer it gets so hot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that you know nobody wants to do anything
 		um
 		oh uh one time we went to Arkansas
 		and did some camping
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'd almost forgotten about that
 		six years ago i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do do you go up in the mountains or mainly stay in campgrounds
 	
 	
 		well we didn't really have any just second  what
 		is it getting worse and worse
 		okay
 		um
 		uh no we really didn't go up in the mountains
 	
 	
 		you basically just go with the KOA campgrounds or something like that
 	
 	
 		well this was a uh it wasn't a KOA what was  Frazier what was that that we went to in Arkansas
 		it was a park it was a state park
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a state park
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um and they had trails you know that we could go on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we were going to go on the river but the river was so high that year it'd been raining so much that they wouldn't let anybody get on the river
 	
 	
 		huh i'll be
 	
 	
 		yeah there were a lot of snakes around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh it was Snake River
 		oh Snake River with a lot of snakes in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my experience at camping is a little bit different um we do we do do a little family camping but  i do a lot of elk hunting with uh bow and arrow elk and deer hunting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and uh so i i we go back into the mountains using horses and and uh go and we'll pack in sometimes as far as ten miles
 		back in just on horseback and we'll stay for ten days and
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and that's a lot of fun but it's it's not real uh conducive to taking my wife uh she doesn't appreciate being away from civilization that long and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh no electricity and no you know we you you take a bath in the creek and freeze to death while you're doing it but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh my gosh that's really roughing it
 	
 	
 		uh it is but it is fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of course i guess it takes the right personality
 	
 	
 		have you only done that once or you've done that several times
 	
 	
 		no no i've done that lots of times
 	
 	
 		you love doing that huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's in fact i as far as i'm concerned i don't get enough
 	
 	
 		really oh wow
 	
 	
 		um but
 		we'll probably go during the summertime on uh like a three-dayers probably two times and then as soon as fall comes on and the hunting season starts
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we usually get one big one and then one big one that'll last probably ten days and then one or two small ones for two or three days at a time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum  TI switchboard
 		well you've done a lot more camping than i have actually my husband's the one that's really the avid camper he you know has a lot more experienced and and he makes it a lot of fun for everybody though because he knows
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when you when you go with someone that's experienced and knows how to do things and it's a lot often fun for everybody else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree it's it's always fun to go with somebody that knows how to cook over an open fire that's a little that's a little different than uh you know heat control at home and and uh uh you can have some lousy meals out there or you can have some great meals um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh yeah
 		that's true when we were in Arkansas we'd been camping for about three days i guess and i was already tired of sleeping on the floor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we ran into a lady that told us about a resort area up there and we checked into one of these resorts and got to sleep in a
 		a nice bed and that that was
 		camping the right kind of camping to me
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well it makes a difference we're we're set up with uh camping cots and uh and uh uh self inflating mattresses and and and things like that and then and then it's not so it's still not like home but it's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		right makes a little bit more comfortable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah do you have kids that you take along
 	
 	
 		yes well yeah but they don't come on the big trips they're very small too i've got a a six a three and a about a one one and a half and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh wow you've really got your hands full
 	
 	
 		yeah and they they enjoy the day ones we'll run up in the mountains like uh when i get off work sometimes and we're not we're not very far we're forty five minutes from some
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		some real nice mountains here and we can go up there and build a fire and cook hot dogs and that's really not camping though that's kind of a picnic's what that is but but
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they enjoy that
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		that's great
