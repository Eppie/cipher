 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so you have a son
 	
 	
 		i have a an older son yeah he doesn't have any children yet though
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh he's thirty seven and i don't know if he's ever going to have any or not but i do have some neighbor kids lots of little neighbor kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that i go out and uh i play ball with them
 		you know it's because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for them
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is kind of sad you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them so i will go out and play catch with them or you know we have let the dogs outside and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs
 		but uh actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids
 	
 	
 		i would think so when you when when your son was at home did you um working did you work or were you able to stay at home with him
 	
 	
 		no when my son was at home i i did work and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about uh five other kids that she baby sat
 		you know but we always had our days off together and we went camping on vacations so we had a lot of time together that way you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well when my mom uh when i was growing up my mom worked too but she worked nights
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh as a nurse and so she was always home for us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i always i really appreciated that having her there when i was you know when i came home from school and when i worked
 		but now when i look back at it it must have been a really difficult thing that she did for us
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well i am sure it was you know but uh
 		i don't know what the families are really going to come to nowadays because they just there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids because most most of them the father and the mother both work
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's really rough um i have one neighbor that's uh the father is a fireman
 		and he works like four days on and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days
 		but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family you know so he's got a second job
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so he's you know he's not home very often
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's you know the kids i know miss that you know
 	
 	
 		they really do uh a family without a father is it's a it's a really hard thing
 	
 	
 		yeah you know and i don't know i i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because
 		you know he is out working trying to make some money for you know we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		kids i think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure they would you know
 		so  are you planning on to having any children or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah our uh-huh but we're um we just got married like like December so we're going to wait a year and then we will try
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um yeah well that's good yeah that's
 		that's what my uh daughter-in-law had told me that they were going to have kids
 		probably after two years of marriage
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they will be married nine years  this year
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i don't know she's a nurse you know and uh she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids so maybe they just decided that uh
 		if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a possibility yeah well we really want to have a family we feel like that that couple you know
 	
 	
 		you know but uh
 	
 	
 		you're not giving enough of yourself and you should you should be sharing your family
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh so
 	
 	
 		and giving your values to you know making something better of the world by raising up good kids and letting them know they're loved and stuff give them give them an edge but
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		we feel like like the first year needs to be devoted to uh making the the family the couple strong and secure in their love for each other
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but then a family is is definitely a high priority
 	
 	
 		yeah uh do you plan on staying home after you have your children or do you do you work or what
 	
 	
 		well i um i'm in a different situation i am a missionary
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm home on on furlough it's called like i've worked for four years in Africa and i come home for a year
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then we go back for four years but my husband and i will do the same job and we'll be living in in Africa and we'll be working together
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh we will we will share the job of raising the family i mean as a mother i'll have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have but still we'll share that job
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but we have then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or do you send them away to boarding school and if you do that when do you do it and that's a
