 
     		
 	
 		talk in the background  she's i don't know what she sees outside well what kind of music do you like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well
 		
 
 		well mostly rock
 	
 	
 		rock
 	
 	
 		yeah what about you
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh everything um
 	
 	
 		well i like well i like different you know different things but uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		primarily you know rock and roll
 	
 	
 		what era of rock and roll or whatever did you prefer
 	
 	
 		oh you know well you i i really like more of the modern stuff you know but i like the oldies you know they're okay
 		but i you know i listen mostly mostly to the you know the modern stations
 	
 	
 		um
 		um i guess we listen to a lot of things um i grew up with the with rock and roll and older brothers and sisters
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so i would i remember always being kind of ahead of my
 		peers just because
 		um you know in third grade i was listening to to groups and stuff that people you know third graders usually aren't interested in music by that time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think now i listen we listen to a variety of stuff um jazz or country and western or
 	
 	
 		see now i don't like country and western uh
 	
 	
 		do you not i don't i don't like the old the old
 	
 	
 		i don't like most you know most of it i don't like but i recently saw that Garth Brooks show
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i thought he was terrific and i really thought i mean i thought he was a great you know really wonderful entertainer the way he um he you know he he was very good
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i there
 		i think country music i don't like the real old twangy stuff like the
 	
 	
 		i don't like twainese no i non't
 	
 	
 		you know but that it has undergone undergone a lot of change and there's a like there's a guy named Lyle Lovett that he could be considered
 	
 	
 		oh he's really not that uh country i mean i've heard him sing stuff that really doesn't sound too you know
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah see he does it's more what do they call it
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		sometimes i've heard it called Rockabilly where it's like rock and roll and or country but um but they refer to him you know as a country singer but a lot of his stuff sounds really jazzy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah right i  yeah i have heard him and uh i didn't think he was a country singer you know i
 	
 	
 		um they i mean they they term him as that but i i know well i've watched like the music awards or the country music awards before and they had him on as a new up and coming country singer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of i mean but there's a lot of people kind of like that that
 		they're they're playing they're right on the line and you know the
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		at the the i guess the rock and roll side might be so saturated that
 		you know they're trying out this and and we've gone country and western dancing before and
 	
 	
 		oh you really
 	
 	
 		but and it when i don't i don't dance i mean country dance that well but
 		you know just watching the people when they get out there is when they start playing the rock and roll music while the band's taking a break
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know i mean they get out there and jitterbug and or you know whatever you want to call it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so i think there's there's a lot of people out there now that aren't aren't just Johnny Cash fans or or you know or um
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't even know what the alternative
 	
 	
 		well you know i said let me watch this and see what all the fuss is about i mean everybody's raving about this guy you know
 		and my son is i have a a son he's uh twenty four and of course he hates country music and he said ma i can't believe you're gonna watch that i said i have to find out
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my best friend said she likes him i said i if Linda likes him i said he's gonna not he he couldn't be all wrong you know i mean he's there's got to be something good about the guy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so i watched it and really i i just thought he was terrific
 	
 	
 		i saw previews of it and it looked more like a rock and roll concert than a
 	
 	
 		i don't know but i mean and his songs uh uh were you know i liked them uh were they weren't that silly country western stuff that you know they used to do years ago you know with with dopey lyrics you know very simple lyrics
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		and there's still some out there like that too
 	
 	
 		uh you know they're
 		yeah oh there are but uh uh yeah i think as a whole it's gotten more definitely more sophisticated in the you know in the past few years
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too i do too
 	
 	
 		you know but then i wouldn't listen you know listen to it uh you know steadily uh you know i wouldn't listen to it at all actually  you know i just don't really care for it any you know it as a whole but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		what station do you listen to radio
 	
 	
 		i usually listen to either the uh classic rock it's uh ninety two or or uh one oh two
 	
 	
 		yeah i switch around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and then my husband loves the oldies you know every time he he gets in the car the car he sticks on the oldies station
 	
 	
 		well it's funny because my my father um i'm youngest of six and we all
 		play some type of music interest instrument instrument and i had a couple of brothers that were in rock and roll bands and
 		so forth so you know he was constantly having to grow up with us so at Christmas or his birthday we're always buying him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		tapes you know to keep him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
