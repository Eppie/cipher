 
     		
 	
 		go now what kinds of things do you like to listen to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		good
 		well my uh uh my interests lie mainly in classical music
 	
 	
 		is that right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh uh uh although i wasn't raised with opera it's something that i've i come to enjoy how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well actually i kind of like those same things myself and um uh i did uh study some music in school although i'm not um
 		a musician i just took it kind of as an avocation and i sing with the Brookhaven singers over at Brookhaven College you must be familiar with that name living in Dallas
 	
 	
 		right absolutely
 	
 	
 		and uh they have um a lovely woman over there who um teaches singing and um
 		has a Saturday class as well as private lessons and uh we go and we sing for some retirement homes and at the Botanical Gardens and things like that and uh
 		really very very very enjoyable and i do try to get down to the symphony at least a couple of times a year and i didn't get down to the opera this year though but i have in the past um
 		but anyway i do enjoy listening to especially the classical music that has some kind of a story line or a theme like Beethoven's Pastoral and things like that where you can
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		follow um through some of the mood of the of the melodies and not just have um you know a kind of mathematical arrangement of the notes which is
 	
 	
 		sound
 	
 	
 		also fascinating many times but i like that break of a kind of a story line sometimes what kind of uh pieces are your favorites
 	
 	
 		well i uh i tend to shy away from anyone who uh uh is born later than nineteen hundred
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		other than Aaron Copeland uh Aaron Copeland i enjoy
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 		uh-huh what about Gershwin
 	
 	
 		oh Gershwin uh Gershwin's uh i i i uh
 		i i haven't uh quite found jazz to be enjoyable and and and a lot of Gershwin has a a some of some of his work is a little uh has has has a touch enough enough of jazz uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that uh that uh is not particularly enjoyable for me to listen to the uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh like i i i suspect my favorites uh are in the uh seventeenth and eighteenth century uh uh musicians uh i'd
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the uh oh there's one uh uh i guess more recent one with uh Copeland uh is uh Raspegie who uh i was always amazed that he was uh so contemporary uh contemporary
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um but i uh
 		uh i our family gets down to uh the Myerson relatively frequently it it's our uh uh our one enjoyable uh if if we can make it to Saturday uh everything's okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's uh it's a relatively busy uh activity we uh one uh very nice uh uh opportunity that we've had is the is the Dallas Chamber Orchestra
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		that has uh uh uh actually it's it's it's wonderful they they have a Sunday matinee that uh uh if you buy two season tickets the kids go free
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh that gives us an opportunity to uh
 		uh to take the to uh uh make sure the kids uh get uh get dressed up and and go to the symphony whether they want to or not and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh and they uh their they oblige us by falling asleep so least that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how old are your children
 	
 	
 		they're uh eleven nine and eight which is and it's it's nice in that uh
 	
 	
 		oh isn't that wonderful though
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in that uh their their you their they you can get real close to the uh to the chamber orchestra and see the music and watch the musicians it's uh it's a very intimate setting and the the music's really very good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i bet it is now i have never heard them um that Myerson auditorium is really is really quite acoustically beautiful i i have to admit that um
 		i had the privilege of going to the uh piano concert that uh Yefgenya Chessum who is a young uh Russian artist gave i guess it was just before Christmas time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i'm telling and and it was no orchestra orchestra or anything it was just he
 	
 	
 		it was just a recital
 	
 	
 		and yes and i'm telling you the sound the sound was so
 		so perfect uh i i had heard you know the orchestra the symphony and we went for the toy symphony and the young children's um uh uh orchestra from SMU and
 	
 	
 		oh um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		several things down there this is the first time i just heard like one artist and
 	
 	
 		right
