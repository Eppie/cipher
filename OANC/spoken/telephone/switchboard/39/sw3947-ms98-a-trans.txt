 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well so you you don't know too much about the Dallas Mavericks this this
 	
 	
 		no what where they at this year uh they win in their division
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no they are uh only just a slightly a bit better than uh the other expansion teams they're they're they're a team in disarray right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh do you do you have a season pass you go watch them or
 	
 	
 		actually i used to and i gave it up this year because i thought well Roy Tarpley wasn't going to make it and sure enough about a week after i decided not to buy my ticket he went down with his uh his drug problems
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh boy the team just is going into a tailspin since then
 	
 	
 		yeah that's too bad i'm i guess i'd be most familiar with uh the Jazz
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and i've never watched them but uh interestingly enough i i i got to meet Carl Malone
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		huh-uh uh well it  i live about forty five miles from Jackpot Nevada
 	
 	
 		how'd you manage that
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it's a town it's a town where they uh have uh uh casinos and so forth
 		and i guess that's one of his pastimes i caught him down there and he was playing the slot machines and uh yeah you know would you know it somebody like him
 		he hit a five thousand dollar jackpot and then he turned around hit hit another two thousand dollar jackpot
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they came and took his picture and you know got the uh the IRS forms and stuff and he sat there and put all the money back into the machine lost every penny of it didn't bother him a bit
 	
 	
 		sound sounds like a real game huh
 	
 	
 		just yeah just doing it for enjoyment
 	
 	
 		well he must he must be a pretty big guy
 	
 	
 		it was incredible when he stood up he just towered he was a good foot above anybody in there
 	
 	
 		gee
 	
 	
 		and uh everybody everybody was uh kind of excited to see him and he's he oddly enough he was uh very friendly and cordial and stopped to sign a few things and
 	
 	
 		well it's it's it's nice to see those those you know those kind of guys when they get paid all those big bucks to uh you know to be halfway friendly
 	
 	
 		so it was it was neat
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i know what you mean about talking about being big i mean that's when i was in high school
 		i got i went to a Cleveland Cavaliers game i'm from Ohio
 		and a friend of mine runs or used to run the clock down on the floor so he'd let me get down on the floor at half time and i stood by these guys they all walked out and and gee whiz they're just monsters
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		seven foot doesn't sound that tall but boy when you stand next to one  it it is real tall
 	
 	
 		yep yeah i hear you so
 	
 	
 		so if you you don't you don't get down to uh basketball games very often then
 	
 	
 		i don't no we've got a small of course this isn't professional basketball but uh the CSI Golden Eagles
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know if you've heard of them they're they're number they're the number one junior college in the state in the nation excuse me
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh so they're here and they're kind of fun to go watch but uh uh that's that's the the most closest i get to in fact i've only seen one professional basketball game uh
 	
 	
 		so you didn't watch the all star game uh yesterday
 	
 	
 		i kind of watched it on television parts of it i didn't i didn't see the whole thing
 	
 	
 		yeah i i got out the weather was so nice here that i got out and didn't didn't see any of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh yeah well well what do you think about Magic Johnson should he play or should he
 	
 	
 		well that's uh you you talking about the Olympics now
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess the summer Olympics is uh what they
 	
 	
 		yeah the summer Olympics is his next thing
 		well i really you know it's it's his choice to play but there's a lot of other people you know the other team's choice not not to play against him i think he's gonna find a lot of people just say well heck i'm not going to worry you know i'm not gonna mess with that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh yeah well i don't i think they that they'd feel that way too interestingly enough they've kept a seat a seat open
 		uh and he may even play in the in the tournament games for uh LA
 	
 	
 		are you serious
 	
 	
 		i'm serious i heard that the other day on a sports
 	
 	
 		how can how can they do that if he doesn't played the whole season
 	
 	
 		i i don't know i don't know i guess the roster's one man you know there's a hole there still
 	
 	
 		oh unless they yeah unless they're just carrying a one odd guy instead of carrying the ten or eleven that they carry just carry one less
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		that's what they've done
 	
 	
 		well i you know i didn't watch the game but a a friend of mine was telling me that he you know he played a lot but he he played then he'd sit down then he'd play and he'd sit down and it wasn't like he was out there for twenty or thirty minutes at a at a go
 	
 	
 		and there's
 		yeah
 		no he wasn't and the the the part i saw is he he made the last shot of the game off balance three pointer and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess so
 	
 	
 		yeah once once uh he starts losing that weight and can't keep it on you know he'll have to slow down and not not do that kind of stuff that that's got to be awful tough awful tough on his body
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		well when's your Mavericks gonna do something
 	
 	
 		oh gee whiz  the the they are
 	
 	
 		they need more people they need a coach what do they need
 	
 	
 		they need players and and they need a front office that that can judge players we've traded away so many good players in the past five years and got nothing for them
 	
 	
 		players
 	
 	
 		and drafted so many bad players and you know they haven't turned out
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's very frustrating we had we had one year where we had two first round picks
 		and we picked uh a guy by the name of Bill Wittington uh who's a seven foot center a white guy and Uvay Blob another seven foot white center
 		and they are both okay but i think both of them are playing in the Italy now
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and they you know they they traded away Mark Aguirre and got nothing for him
 		i mean he had to go but they they
 	
 	
 		um-hum
