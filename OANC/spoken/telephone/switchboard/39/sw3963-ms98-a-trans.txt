 
     		
 	
 		i'm ready
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay have you returned anything lately
 	
 	
 		uh no i haven't the only thing i had to i had to return was a table top but that was like three years ago of a dining room table that i got
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it was marked on the top of it so all they did was replace it
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but as far as um lawn mowers i've bought lawn mowers in the last three and a half years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they've been working fine my hedger's working fine my weedeater's working fine i haven't really had to return anything you know except that table top that was marked
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 		now okay wait wait a there was a topic talking about returning lawn equipment
 		or was it anything
 	
 	
 		no i said anything
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		now okay um well i uh i returned a camera recently i i bought a little uh Minolta camera
 	
 	
 		oh you did
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh the auto focus was inconsistent sometimes it would focus and sometimes it wouldn't
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so uh after my second roll of film i i took two rolls before i got decided uh because i changed the first roll out before i had the first one developed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and after i got the first roll back i knew the camera wasn't it so i uh i took it back and returned it but most i don't know i haven't had to return a lot of stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well did did they give you any back any problem or they just give you a new one or what
 	
 	
 		well i took it back and i figured it was i don't know something like an auto focus i don't know i figured something inherent in the camera design or something
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i  because my dad has a has an auto focus camera
 		and it works great and he's never had any problems in fact he's he's had a couple of them and this is a like a little small one you know and the new smaller cameras are like all mass produced and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		so they're not uh i think they're more uh i would think there there's better quality control on those things you know just because they're small and stamped and there's not very sophisticated
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i guess not call it quality control but you know since they're so generic they wouldn't uh there's you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i my dad has a big sophisticated camera and it always takes good pictures so i just said well hell with it i'll just go out and get a nice camera
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh so i took it back and uh i bought a
 		i bought a more expensive camera but you know i think when uh when i was in college i was always buying like just cheap stuff stuff that would make do and that's the kind of stuff i took back because you bring it home and you're like oh well this sucks you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah if you go and buy something really good usually it is it's good you know
 	
 	
 		oh um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you don't ever anyhow i've haven't ever had any problems in returning anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that i've bought that i feel that you know was worth the money that you pay for it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah and i think uh the way i was raised my parents always uh used to buy stuff that had a good quality name on it and you know they knew the quality of it before they bought it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i don't know and i kind of do the same thing i guess so i haven't had to return a lot if i had had to return it it's more because i realize i didn't need it or you know not because it's defective
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh more because uh you know i have the option to take it back and i really didn't need it you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		rather than you know something being broken
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but that's that's the only thing i've returned recently
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've been really lucky knock on wood you know like i say that i haven't had to return anything except this this table when it came out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the top of it was marked and so all i did was replace the top of it you know
 	
 	
 		hm
 		did they send you a new one or did they actually give you a new one at the store
 	
 	
 		they they gave me well no i didn't go to the store and get it they you know got with the manufacturer and then when it came in then they brought it out and then just took this table top off and replaced it with the other table top
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah because i bought some furniture where the top was scratched and uh i just wrote a letter to the manufacturer well they they had a warranty sheet saying if you have any damage send this in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i sent it in and uh you know i didn't really think much the table like i said the table was just scratched on the top and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i didn't really it didn't really bother me because it was kind of small
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i went ahead and sent something in and uh
 		three or four weeks later they sent me a brand new table top
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it came by truck
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i like it was probably more expensive to ship this thing than it cost me for the table top itself
 		because uh it was eighty five dollars for shipping and the whole it was a like a computer table you know made with just like uh uh what do they call pressed board or whatever just pressed particle board
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 		yeah with
 		or with a veneer top or something like that probably yeah
 	
 	
 		right and uh the tole table was only like a hundred and ten bucks
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they spent eighty five dollars shipping this top back to me
 	
 	
 		oh for crying out loud
 	
 	
 		so i was kind of surprised i figured you know i sent that in maybe they would send me something back saying you know uh do you want to exchange it or bring it in or send it back or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh i couldn't believe they sent actually sent a brand new one and they no calls no letters nothing they just sent it to me
 	
 	
 		just sent it to you that's weird  you'd think that they would have wrote a letter or at least a telephone call you know telling you that this is what was happening you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		definitely
 		yeah yeah uh
 		um-hum um-hum yeah but
 	
 	
 		but um you know but um
 	
 	
 		oh well but
 		i'd say that's a kind of a short topic this time
 	
 	
 		yeah i was just i was just trying to think of um what else have i bought
 		the only other thing that when we moved in this house it was a new house and the grate where you have your fireplace
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
