 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay what are you are you doing anything in Utah on recycling
 	
 	
 		well in uh our particular area uh we're not other than uh
 		they have a local store that you can take uh
 		bottles and
 		cans and different things to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in their parking lot and uh
 		in the winter we haven't been doing that but uh
 		they don't uh
 		that's about all they're doing
 	
 	
 		is it a small town
 	
 	
 		yes it's a rural area
 	
 	
 		that makes a difference uh here in Dallas they're trying to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to start some curbside recycling i think they're doing a test uh personally my husband and i do plastic and glass and newspaper and cans but we have to uh take them you know to
 		to areas and the problem that i'm finding is that uh a lot of the places i've been taking things have now discontinued the recycling policy like it's hard to find a place to take newspapers anymore
 	
 	
 		um-hum yes so that's uh that's basically what happened up here and then uh with all the recycling the price of aluminum cans went down
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah it used to be about sixty cents a pound and so people were collecting them and taking them in to recycle
 		uh to get money for them now it's down to about nineteen cents a pound
 	
 	
 		well i noticed a difference uh we go to the Kroger store uh here to take our aluminum cans and i noticed a difference you know i'd be getting perhaps a dollar for whatever i took in and i think the last bunch i took in which i didn't think was much smaller was maybe twenty six cents
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's what's happened and i don't know if that's from recycling i i understand it is but
 		here uh we do we do recycle our newspapers and give them to the scouts
 		and they uh they're able to make some money
 		uh
 		that way
 		but i have a son in Illinois who uh
 		they pick it up they have a  a recycling uh garbage uh pick up where they have different
 		uh receptacles where they put it in
 		they have some for the cans some for the bottles and newspapers
 		and then they have the regular garbage and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		this truck comes before the garbage truck and picks uh
 		and has separate bins to put all the glass and the plastic and all that in
 		that seems to be working quite well there that's uh in uh  Illinois
 	
 	
 		well you know what is so sad is that people are finally i think willing to do something about this and then all of a sudden uh the the demand isn't there you know it's too expensive to recycle but i personally feel that we're going to have to
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		pay the price you know whether the government subsidizes it and i'm you know i sorry to the government government get involved in too much of anything else like that but something has to be done we're just uh we're using our natural resources we're filling up the dumps and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		well i've that's what they in the local the local paper here they were talking about that uh half about half the uh
 		the material in the dumps is newspapers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they could recycle that uh more than they do then uh
 		um
 		we'd be able to save a lot of trees and everything else so i've been i i i'm all for it i just don't know uh
 		i know my son uh in Chicago where he has this they have uh
 		uh they have to pay extra to have them pick it up even though and and so that's kind of a a burden on my uh
 		my son even though they they put it in different containers they still have to pay extra money to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well and i know uh too my mother lives in a rural area also and it she would have to go like thirty miles to recycle anything and so course so of course she she doesn't and plus uh it's difficult for her to
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		um
 	
 	
 		drive around just all that much so in a case like that you know they have to make it a little bit easier for people
 	
 	
 		yes they do
 	
 	
 		to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i'm hoping that they do this curbside recycling i'll be willing to pay a little extra you know if they'll go ahead and pick it up quite frankly it'll save me money in gas running around all over town
 	
 	
 		right
 		yep boy  that's true
 	
 	
 		and i take my uh paper i always get paper bags and i take them back to the grocery store and use them again
 	
 	
 		hm right
 	
 	
 		so you know little bit here and little bit there i guess it all helps
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it it really does if we could just get uh people uh
 		all over to do it now i know in uh south of us about a hundred miles south in Utah they do have a uh area where
 		uh they bring all the garbage in and they uh they do have places to recycle and they really encourage this and uh you can bring it and you have different areas
 		um that's a small yeah well it's next to Provo Utah i don't know if you're familiar with Utah at all but anyway
 	
 	
 		not a lot but i've heard the name Provo before
 	
 	
 		it's where Brigham Brigham Young University is uh this
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh there they seem to be having success and but it is a uh
 		it's done by the
 		it for profit making for these people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they of course are
