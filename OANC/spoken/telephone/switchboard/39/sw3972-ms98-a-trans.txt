 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay we have uh we have a family reunion every every summer and uh we different uh sides of the family take turns on planning it sending out the invitations and
 		and then uh the activities that we have we kind of get together and have a luncheon or a lunch or a a cookout or barbecue or whatever
 		and uh and get to know so all the cousins get to know each other and
 		we really enjoy our our family uh get togethers and family reunions so to speak
 		are you able to do that
 	
 	
 		yes we have ours every three years and uh we have uh relatives in Mexico and Brownsville Texas and Pennsylvania Ohio um
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		West Virginia Virginia and Florida so we've got them everywhere New Jersey and that's why we only have one every three years so that everybody can get together and we uh have one from early morning it starts at eleven
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it goes all day and we just had one a year and a half ago we have it every summer in a
 		place called Bare Rocks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		its a  it was a a resort and it was catered and um
 		i hadn't seen cousins that i hadn't seen for years and others that are new in the family from marriage or
 	
 	
 		well that's really great and uh they're able to come from long distances like that we we have children in Ohio and uh
 		Texas and Germany and Illinois and uh all over but uh
 		they get to some of them but this is uh the ones that live in Utah and but it it's sure great uh those family reunions are really something but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		aren't they wonderful
 	
 	
 		at uh
 	
 	
 		uh it's a shame that people can't get together like that more often and and uh
 		have a close family tie
 	
 	
 		it really is because that that really helps and like say to get to know each other and the background and we uh we the one that we have every year uh we go up to uh
 		go up into the canyon and camp out for uh over the weekend and uh it we
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		have a bonfire and uh sit around and in the evening and uh around the pine trees in the pine trees in the mountains and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the atmosphere's just really nice and then the kids get to play with each other and it uh it's a super thing uh
 	
 	
 		that sounds like fun we only have ours for that one day and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then we make plans who's going to have the next one where it's going to be and all that and the next one i believe is going to be in New Jersey next year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um
 		do you have a large family
 	
 	
 		uh we have uh there's probably about uh
 		our own own family there is we had six children but we have uh my wife's side of the family is the one that we go up to uh
 		Idaho up in the canyon and uh there's probably about uh forty people there
 		and uh total and then we do have another get together at Christmas time on my side of the family and uh this last one we had eighty five people to that one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that's good how many was in your family
 	
 	
 		uh we have uh i had five uh four brothers and one sister
 		and then on my wife's side of the family she had uh four sisters and uh a brother
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so we're kind of from large families and then they're all married and all have their children and they come and uh so it's it's really quite a get together we've been doing this uh up in Idaho in the summer in the camp out for
 		uh we're thirty nine years every summer we've done this and we do it the second week in July between the Fourth of July and the twenty fourth of July which is a holiday here in Utah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		what's the holiday
 	
 	
 		it's uh when the pioneers came into Utah and settled uh Utah Brigham Young came in on the twenty fourth of July
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and when they came across they came from the east in the covered wagons and uh settled or started the settlement of Salt Lake City
 		so
 	
 	
 		is there a special uh type of festivities for that occasion too
 	
 	
 		yeah uh they have uh we have uh a large parade in Salt Lake City it's probably the one of the biggest parades in the country it goes for about three or four hours
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh of course uh it's a state holiday
 		and so we uh
 		we have ours between that and uh the week between those the fourth and twenty fourth and
 		so every year we know
