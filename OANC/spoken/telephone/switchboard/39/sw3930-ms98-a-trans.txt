 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		hello yeah okay
 	
 	
 		hello yeah
 		yeah well i uh on capital punishment here in Utah it uh
 		we do have the death penalty for murder
 		and uh
 		the
 		uh
 		the either the jury or the judge can make that determination depending on the crime the seriousness of the crime
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's been uh uh
 		it's been uh oh it's been four or five years ago since uh someone was actually uh put on death row well there's some quite a few on death row but uh before one was executed
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the same way it is here
 	
 	
 		and it uh we've got some that uh have been there for ten or fifteen years and
 		i don't know my opinion on on uh the death penalty i think it's uh
 		personally i think it would be a deterrent if uh they were able to carry this out without many appeals
 		but they appeal and appeal and uh it just goes on forever but
 	
 	
 		right right it's just nothing but cost the taxpayers lots of money huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it really does and uh uh i i have i've always felt that uh
 		if they murder someone in cold uh in cold blood they know what they're doing and uh
 		that they should be uh
 		pay made to pay for it but if we don't have a deterrent of some kind then it just gets to the point where
 		and if people it's just if they want to do it they do it and then they they think well i'll be out in uh
 		two or three years and a lot of them are
 	
 	
 		yeah and then they end up doing it again
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		no i think that's very very very wrong
 		um i'm with you i think if they if they've killed somebody they should they should pay for it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know period no you know none of this going on and on and on and on
 	
 	
 		right
 		what if the
 		where it's so clear cut we've had a couple cases here where they were actually caught and they uh and they had witnesses where they had killed two or three people
 		and there was one that they thought they'd killed but they hadn't and they had the witness and
 		and uh they did all kinds of things to these poor people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and this one they thought they had killed him but uh they hadn't and the the police were able to get them but they they did uh were able to uh have the one uh
 		executed but the other one is still appealing and uh
 		it's uh
 		it's really a sad thing especially for the families of those that were involved
 	
 	
 		yeah you know i don't in other countries i don't think they do that if someone does something bad like that they just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		do it right now you know
 	
 	
 		right and and they don't have the crime rate that we have here i know my son uh was over in Saudi Arabia but he was over there during the war and he said man somebody over there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh they they kill someone and the and uh that's it they're killed or they
 	
 	
 		yeah they pay for it right now yeah
 	
 	
 		right and so he says you really don't have that he could see the crime rate was very low over there because people knew the consequences
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but here it's got to the point where i think it's gone too far the other way
 	
 	
 		yeah you know like like you say you know anything they do they don't care they could go out and rob somebody if they get caught they know they're just going to be out in just a little while anyhow
 	
 	
 		uh
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so it's the same thing you know but uh i just don't think that they should let it go on and on and on like they do
 	
 	
 		well i know made in the point you made about the taxpayer paying for it when you start considering the cost of fifty to sixty thousand dollars a year to keep them in prison
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		plus all the attorney costs  all of that the taxpayers pay for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh the victims they don't get anything other than just the heartache and going through this and going through it appeal after appeal and i don't know i
 	
 	
 		yeah they make it wait for so long and then people forget actually what did happen you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and then they find some little glitch uh in the law and uh you either turn them loose or
 		or put them in prison for life and then maybe after a few years they're paroled
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		so i don't know it's it's uh quite a situation i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i wish they'd get back to that but uh every once in a while there was a fellow that was executed in uh Wyoming the state next to us
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh about a month ago and uh of course he he said he wanted to be because he he had done the you know he he admitted to it and everything he said i just don't want to stay in prison and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so the lawyers couldn't do anything to stop that one  but anyway it's uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		it makes you wonder how they can live with themselves when they do something like that huh
 	
 	
 		i
 		well it does and then you try to teach your children uh respect for for uh
