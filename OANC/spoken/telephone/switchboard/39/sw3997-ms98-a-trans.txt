 
     		
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't exercise on a regular basis i think about it a lot
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i chase an eighteen month old and i think if i do much else i'm gonna fall over
 	
 	
 		well isn't that the truth
 	
 	
 		so
 		that's um i like exercising i feel good when i do it
 		but i find it real hard to fit it into a schedule
 	
 	
 		well i just started going back to aerobics
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's three times a week and
 		it just the minute you get off work you got to run over there change clothes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		do that come home take a bath you know get cleaned up and there's always people at our house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and things going on and it it's hard it's hard to fit it in and i'm not one of these that loves aerobics anyway
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		no
 	
 	
 		we're going snow skiing in March so i'm wanting to get in shape before we went so that i wouldn't just fall over dead
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		up there but i thought as soon as this is over i am quitting
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just
 	
 	
 		it's not going to last long huh
 	
 	
 		no and i you feel good after you you know you work out but it's always a mental chore for me to get psyched up to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but once i get there i'm all right
 	
 	
 		yeah well now i did find uh a video that i really liked and i just can't quite convince myself it's worth paying for yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it was Richard Simmons Sweating to the Oldies
 	
 	
 		oh i know i saw that i want that
 	
 	
 		it's a lot of fun my son likes it
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 	
 	
 		no my girlfriend and i used to work out to it right before Christmas and we put him in her playpen at her house and he thought that was the funniest thing to watch us dancing around because it's more like just dancing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it is
 	
 	
 		than anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah and the but the fact that all the movements that they do are exactly what you need to but the fact that it's songs that you like and movements that are not so hard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's true and the only other thing about that was that they weren't maybe songs that i was real familiar with
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i could feel it it it wasn't that you couldn't feel that it was working
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i'm out of shape and i could feel it working but i enjoyed what i was doing so much that it was pretty much one of those i didn't care that i was really working out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's the only video i have even considered buying
 	
 	
 		well and it's one of three he has Sweating To The Oldies Two and Three and i haven't seen the other two but i really think they'd be a lot of fun to have
 	
 	
 		i think so i think they're around twenty dollars apiece aren't they yeah
 	
 	
 		yes even at a discount store i've looked at them and they're about eighteen ninety for one of them so uh that's why i say i can't quite
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i can't see paying some one to enjoy watching me sweat and uh not and not enjoy myself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know
 	
 	
 		that was the other thing about working out
 	
 	
 		i have a friend that lives in Dallas and she every day goes to some gym and they work out on all kinds of machines and the whole bit and i just thought you must be kidding
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		and then they got to a while they'd go before work
 		may be work out for an hour i thought y'all are eaten up with it just  yeah just eaten up with it but they're young and they're single and
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 		you people are crazy
 		oh well there's half of it right there
 	
 	
 		that kind of stuff um-hum and i said well that's what's the matter with you get married and you won't care
 	
 	
 		
 
 		have those babies and it changes
 	
 	
 		really i don't have any children i all my friends do i've got one that the minute she had the baby she lost every bit of the weight
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and was right back a skinny little thing again and i thought you make me sick
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i agree i agree
 	
 	
 		but she's young she's about twenty twenty two
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i thought well that's what it is you're just you're just a child
 	
 	
 		well that's a part of it i bet because i'm well i'm twenty nine now i just turned twenty nine
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i haven't lost hardly anything and my son's a year and a half
 	
 	
 		um-hum some people i don't know i've got another friend that i'm twenty nine and she's twenty nine
 		after she had her son she said i was just too busy to eat
 		she she had a two year old and then she had a had another one and she says i just don't have time to eat she says i one i'm fooling with one and then i'm fooling with the other one
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wrong
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and she said i just at night time i think boy i don't think i've had anything eat today
 	
 	
 		well there's no way no there's no way i i make time to eat
 	
 	
 		and that's how she lost hers yeah
 		well really
 	
 	
 		because when he particularly his age now  he and i eat the same things and if i'm not eating he doesn't eat very well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i have to eat
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		you did so good on the others you keep doing that one
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he's stripping Crayolas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that was always fun
