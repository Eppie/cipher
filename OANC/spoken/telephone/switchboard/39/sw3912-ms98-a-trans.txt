 
     		
 	
 		now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		uh yes we currently have three we have two cats and a dog
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		well  we have quite a big household here
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness are they uh a specialty kind of um cats or
 	
 	
 		well they're um
 		uh
 		the we have a solid black one that's kind of long hair and uh but he's i don't know he's has a little Persian in him but we're not not sure how much and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that we inherited the neighbors uh
 		Persian and when they had to move to a place that wouldn't allow cats so uh he was like a full full blooded Persian um
 		and then our dog's a big old golden retriever
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how about you you have some
 	
 	
 		well we have uh a cat and a dog and a turtle
 	
 	
 		and a turtle hm
 	
 	
 		a turtle we have a turtle uh the the turtle kind of was inherited from the school where i teach the uh children found it last year  going out through the uh property
 		it's just a small one it's not one of those large ones at all it's one a very very small turtle
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they had it in their classroom all year long almost and were going to let it go
 		and i didn't have the heart it it wasn't even my classroom it was the next door classroom i didn't have the heart to watch them let it go so i said i would keep it during the summer time so uh we are
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh was it
 		well we we were in uh similar we kind of did a did a similar thing uh we inherited a lizard from my uh my son's uh uh class
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		and uh it it it it it finally it  died about two weeks ago so my son had a uh yeah uh had had a little funeral he made a little coffin and he buried it in the yard and made a little cross for it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		uh-huh oh my goodness well you know and it's it's it's very hard for me to have any living uh creatures
 		and and then uh sort of watch them disappear it was no trouble to have this turtle it has uh tank and then they don't do anything and it's not large
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh our cat uh is a another little story we've had the cat for several years now but um uh uh when my my children uh
 		started school at Cistercian school up in Irving you might be familiar with it since you're from the general location it's a boys school well anyway uh one of the persons in the car pool
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh their cats were always having kittens and uh my husband was driving the car pool one day he was off from work and he said he'd accept one of the cats now i had been avoiding this for years
 	
 	
 		oh had you
 	
 	
 		but he said that when the cats were weaned that we would take one of the cats
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now i don't really mind i don't really mind but i know that once you take a little living creature there that there's another responsibility in in the house and uh
 	
 	
 		yes yes there is and uh
 	
 	
 		so we have uh a uh what do we have Siamese all the Siamese traits came out in this one particular cat it's not a thoroughbred Siamese
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it looks if you were to see it you'd say oh you have a Siamese cat but i know it's not a thoroughbred but it it and we have had her for many
 	
 	
 		it looks Siamese yeah
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i think we've had her almost eight years now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		seven years or something
 	
 	
 		well we just had a uh uh oh it happened about a year ago we had a cat that we had
 		for uh twenty years uh the the year we got married we we got the cat and she finally uh died right after uh Christmas a a year ago
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		
 
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		and that was kind of uh
 		uh a sad parting but she had a little bit of Siamese
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh if you looked at her face you'd you'd picture Siamese although she was solid black too but
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um uh my wife uh uh uh kind of missed her because she was uh a cat you could hold in your lap and stuff the two cats we have now don't care at all to be
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		held or anything like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum well our our cat is um
 		is not the most lap cat although she will uh when she's uh in the right mood uh you know let you hold her on her lap uh and you know she's not uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh a a bad cat but uh she she kind of is her own cat in in her own way although as i said she will uh she will come around you and she will let you hold her but she's not really a lap cat hum-um
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		on on her own terms
 		and what kind of what kind of dog do you have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh we have a um a black uh Lab
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah they're friendly too
 	
 	
 		and actually it's a cross between a golden and a black so it has longer hair
