 		right
 		uh-huh
 		what happened
 	
 	
 		well i was driving down six thirty five at the um coming from North Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i was uh going um almost hitting the um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		entry where all the the merges go from six thirty five seventy five and Coit and uh all of a sudden i get this liquid all over my hood and my windshield
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i had smelled it before i thought and i thought
 		that it was coming from another vehicle
 		and then when i saw it go all over my car i thought oh oh something
 		came through my radiator and just
 		something's wrong inside my car so i i was waiting for my car to collapse you know i go i was going about sixty five miles an hour
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it kept going and i thought well what is going on
 		and so i made it home and i looked at my car and it was a mess
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i immediately the next morning i took it to my dealer
 		and i i left it just how i drove it in the the night before and he says well it looks like your uh antifreeze
 		uh something happened to your antifreeze
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and they checked everything in that car and it wasn't from my car
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it was from some other car some other car did that to me well i'm glad but it was a very panicky situation
 	
 	
 		some other car had too
 		well isn't that something well oh sure
 		right
 	
 	
 		but no i do not do any of my own repairs the only thing i do to my car is put gas in it and wash it
 	
 	
 		well i do i do some of my own repairs yes i do i i have learned to do this
 	
 	
 		oh you do well good for you
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		that uh my husband drives uh sports cars races he races them as a hobby
 	
 	
 		oh i see oh well he probably showed you all the tricks of the trade that's great
 	
 	
 		yes and he said you need to know how to do all this stuff so i do change my own oil um
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		most in fact i have changed out a whole engine in uh one of sons' trucks
 	
 	
 		you did well bless your heart
 	
 	
 		yes i took the whole thing out and i fixed it but i think it's really important to know these things if you can
 	
 	
 		well i think that's wonderful i mean  i think that's great
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		but now if i could talk him into doing this i'll let him do it i've told him i've learned how but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well gee you should uh you know you should get some money for your talents and start branching out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i don't think i wanna work on too many people's cars that's hard work i think they earn their money i do
 	
 	
 		it is
 		oh well you know uh loosening those nuts and bolts would be a problem for me
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i know they have some really sophisticated equipment today where they do it electronically and all that but that takes money to buy those kind of tools too
 	
 	
 		yes it does now i i don't think i will be able to work on you know too many cars much longer because they are sophisticated and i just can't fool with these computers and things that they have in it that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right yeah no i wouldn't want
 		my i wouldn't want anybody to touch my car without having all the the yeah the uh computer and all and everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the proper tools right that's
 		but it uh
 		i had just gotten a new car this year and i i take it back to the dealer i take this one to the dealer
 	
 	
 		because you have that uh as a as a gift to you don't you that they do it for you for gratis
 	
 	
 		yes  right uh-huh at least this first year  and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 		well i have a woman's agreement on mine and they they did it for three years
 	
 	
 		oh well that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that really was nice so i uh appreciated that uh
 		a present that they gave me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that that is really good but i can't think of any offhand um problems we have really had lately you know that we've had to fix
 		uh the one thing we have problem with is our electricals anything that goes electrical wrong with the cars we don't even try to fool with those ourselves
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh those
 		to me they're very difficult to locate the problem if you
 	
 	
 		well don't they have if you that they hook it up to the computer and the computer does the analysis and tells you what's wrong with with different areas yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		well right they can do that with the new ones uh-huh with these newer cars you can do that and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but other than that the
 		the oil changes and the gases
 		water and antifreeze i do keep that in there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i i have put windshield washer solvent in the container but and
 	
 	
 		yeah have you ever changed a windshield wiper
 	
 	
 		no i have not  this one hasn't needed any thus thus far
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
