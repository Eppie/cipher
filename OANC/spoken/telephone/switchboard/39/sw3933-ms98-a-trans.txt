 
     		
 	
 		that proposal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well actually i've i you know it kind of caught me by surprise i haven't ever really thought about
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh you know mandatory public service i obviously believe in public service and you know think it's a good idea i i i i'm not sure if they would get
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the service they anticipate if they force it do you understand what i'm saying i mean you know you're gonna get a lot more commitment a lot more desire a lot more uh
 	
 	
 		that's a good yeah good point
 	
 	
 		maybe quality time effort energy from somebody who really truly wants to be there so although i believe in it i'm not sure requiring it would be the way to go
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you know what i've noticed at least in our in my field that that works is to require before a person can
 		enter the school program that they do a number of volunteer hours in that field or in in an environment that's related to that field and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that might be more motivating um in relation to what you just mentioned if it were somehow of interest to them
 	
 	
 		that's true if there were enough opportunities
 	
 	
 		i suppose uh that would really require a lot of
 		participation on the part of employers to require a certain number of
 		community uh community service hours in their area  that's
 	
 	
 		well that or have something available in that field you know and and when you go to employers then is it really a public service
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		thing or more of an internship you know i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		i really like the idea of young people getting a chance to
 		to do something of a volunteer nature maybe in another country but that that's difficult for a lot of people i guess financially to
 		to manage but it would certainly i think contribute to a person's responsibility and and sense of maturity um to recognize what other cultures and other countries
 		go through in terms of their day to day existence if you're working in Peace Corps for example you're really gonna be able to learn those things
 	
 	
 		i i definitely agree and i i had you know some family that did serve in the Peace Corps and i i always thought it was a wonderful thing
 		um i i do think that if people have the opportunity to do it it's something that you know they won't forget it enriches your life and gives you like you said a a good understanding of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh well what do i wanna say we take so much we we take what we have for granted you know we're very blessed in this country and and we take so much for granted because we really don't realize uh
 	
 	
 		yeah we really
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how other cultures and other other countries live so i i definitely agree that it's it's good i just you know it i i
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to to require it i think would take a lot of forethought and planning if you wanna get the type of service you know that you're anticipating that you're hoping for
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		it's a little challenging today too to think about being in another country where there's
 		uh potentially political or  military problems that are gonna effect Peace Corps workers if a person is volunteering
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's one thing because they recognize there's a minimal danger where where they might be but if you're
 		expecting that they have to do it then you you you perhaps the whoever the whoever the organization is requiring it does assume some responsibility too
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		that's true and then i guess i can look around you know i i automatically when the uh
 		switchboard suggested Peace Corps i kind of like you i thought international or going out of the country and i i look around though and there's an awful lot of public service that could be done within our own communities and our own
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know a lot of times people say i don't wanna go somewhere else i wanna help my own community you know United United Way i want my dollars to work here something like that so that might also be a motivating factor then
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		i i think it's terrific to have criminals involved in community services and i really like the idea of avoiding jail time for people who are just um um
 		paying if you wanna call it that for minor offenses having them do something in the in the community
 	
 	
 		minor offenses yeah
 		i agree i think that's a very good idea
 		what you said the field you're in what field are you in does it apply
 	
 	
 		i i'm an occupational therapist and so it's hospital work that um i know this is true in occupational therapy as well as physical therapy there's so many people who are applying to the schools right now
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		that they require that you do X number of volunteer hours i think it's a hundred or so before you can even be accepted into the school program to become a therapist
 	
 	
 		okay
 		so you have to do it in that field actually
 		like if you like you
 	
 	
 		i believe you do yeah you have to volunteer in a department that that provides occupational therapy or physical therapy if that's the
 		the area you're pursuing i'm sure that there are other reasons for them wanting people to do that because a person may actually get into the program and not have a very good idea of what
 		it is to be an OT or a PT and having been a volunteer they'll certainly see people on the job and recognize well this is really what i wanna do i wanna spend three or four years getting this experience
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's true well and it might also make them realize jeez this isn't what i thought it was i don't wanna do this that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		exactly which which is which is definitely the case in
