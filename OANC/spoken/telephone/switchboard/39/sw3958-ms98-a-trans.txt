 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do regular exercise
 	
 	
 		since i was just feeling extremely guilty about this  it's a timely question um i do not exercise enough i have um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm overweight and uh under under exercised and um can i can tell it affects me and i don't know why i can't make myself do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		have you have you tried uh you know beginning something and it hasn't worked so you've
 		stopped after a while or just try to get
 	
 	
 		well i used to i used to do more things uh currently i've just gotten a they're a really nice tape Angela Lansbury has done and it's very mild it's mostly stretching but i've i've
 		more mornings than not i will do at least ten minutes with her which is a good starter then then there's a twenty minute part afterwards that i tell myself every day when i get back i have a
 		erratic schedule you know and when i come back in i'll do the twenty minutes uh-huh but anyway uh
 	
 	
 		well that's good i mean at least you've given some time to it every day it's not as if you're not doing anything
 	
 	
 		it's  some some a little something yes but uh i really enjoy walking and somehow i'll do it for a while maybe a month or two months and you know walk two miles a day or something and then
 		and then quit i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's hard hard to schedule in what about you
 	
 	
 		it is you know i think the problem for me has always been trying to find a time of day that's going to work um
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i think probably the best way to get it done is to do it in the morning but i'm not a morning person
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		and if i try to wait till the end of the day when i think i have a little bit more time i don't always have the energy level
 	
 	
 		yeah that's hard isn't it  uh that that four to six o'clock i see a lot of people out walking and i just think oh i'm just going to go and you know just sit
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		you get home and you start fixing dinner or whatever
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		um i've tried to do a combination of stretching and and strengthening because my problem has been
 		keeping strong i think enough i i tend if i don't
 		i tend to have over stretched muscles in fact it's called a hypomobility
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but if i don't keep strong enough i can pull a muscle more easily say if i go on vacation
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		uh and pick up some heavy suitcases it might stretch a muscle that
 		would not have felt injured if i had kept the muscle strong enough to really support the joints so
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and so do you do it
 	
 	
 		that's
 		well you know tomorrow night there's a sale at one of the shopping centers close by on barbells  well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and you're thinking about getting them
 	
 	
 		i'm definitely going to because i work at a hospital where there is a physical therapy department and i've used their barbells for a long while but i know i need to get more regular and do it at home so if i
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		purchase my own i think i'm more inclined to do so and they're a good price
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 		it is and it is hard to do i mean it is easier to do at home even the walking which i can do right here the idea of getting of getting in a car to drive to a
 		a place which a number of my friends keep suggesting
 		just exhausts me because i drive so much in my job and i just am not going to get back in the car to drive somewhere you know and there are all these people there and you have to put on these clothes and and i uh so i'd much rather do it here now my daughter has a
 	
 	
 		see i can't do that
 		yeah and
 		
 
 		
 
 		that's that's exactly the same with me
 	
 	
 		a bike uh but it's a real bike and she cycles and she can put it on a thing but you have to be the right size to fit that
 	
 	
 		oh so you've thought about that as well a bike exercise
 	
 	
 		i've thought i've thought about doing that uh this tape is nice walking as i say is one that i really like i'm concerned about flexibility i'm i'm almost fifty and and i can you know begin to feel a little of that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		going  and and i want to be able to turn around and see if the you know uh when i'm driving uh not just look in the rear view mirror but easily turn around and go up steps and all that without huffing and puffing
 	
 	
 		well
 		right
 		feel it in your neck in other words
 	
 	
 		yes yeah yeah my legs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it's interesting some people choose to go to classes because they feel that that will maintain their motivation they've either invested the money in it or there're people there that expect them or
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		whatever but i think it's just the opposite with me i i need to have the flexibility to do it on my own time and yet
 		i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		well there is there is that that is a plus and i did do that i used to do it and and it and it is a plus and i almost took Tai Che that's something that's interested me for a long time and i
 	
 	
 		it is beautiful um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh uh it is beautiful and it seems like it it combines a lot of things so so you know sort of a a mental attitude as well as the physical but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		the  the the guy insisted that you would have to come everytime he and i thought well this is really good because he's you know dedicated and you have to do these things but the first
 		three Saturdays uh i was doing trainings  i mean you know it's it was on Saturday mornings and already they you know i i already couldn't do it so i was like oh okay well that's
 	
 	
 		oh jobs
 		uh-huh
 		needs to be more flexible for your schedule
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the problem and he just says has to be you know i've got a class opening at nine thirty on Saturday and you can every once in a while go to a different class but you that's when you're supposed to come
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and actually i hadn't been doing any Saturday trainings and then all of a sudden
 		right when the class opened
 	
 	
 		i'm
 	
 	
 		you know
 		so
