 
     		
 	
 		children do you have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh just the one screamer
 	
 	
 		okay  How old how old i is uh he or she
 	
 	
 		he's eighteen months today
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		year and a half
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		huh yeah and he's um he's discovered pens and that you lick the backs of stamps
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's what he was screaming about  i just uh
 	
 	
 		well i would suppose a lot of your time is spent with yours then
 	
 	
 		yes i i'm a full time mother and i spend all day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yes and i spend all day with the baby
 	
 	
 		uh-huh How how do you see most of the world now uh uh the country spending time with their children
 	
 	
 		i see a real growing trend for families going back into the home
 		where a lot a lot more people if they really can can make a a tight budget they're going back to where the women take care of the children at home
 	
 	
 		and not working so much to
 	
 	
 		and not working and not
 	
 	
 		live live in the fancy homes and drive the nice cars
 	
 	
 		yeah i think uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i personally see that happening maybe i'm not in the right neighborhood but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i really do see it a big trend toward that and
 		people even not waiting as late in life as they had been
 		i know for a while that there were people waiting to have their families and i think that trend is is slowing down
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh i i'd have to agree with you that's what's happening back here in the west more people are
 		are just saying it's not worth it and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and spending more time at at home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i know it's tough for our family to do that i've got three kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh my oldest one is only six but she's still in dance and kindergarten and you know she's got a bunch of things going on and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i my it's a good thing my wife she she does work a little bit she works part time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as a college instructor she at a junior college here but she has time to go to all of her uh dance concert recitals and things and and it just means so much and i i try to be there but i don't get to go all the time
 	
 	
 		ah uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well i agree it
 		it's really important to me to support my family
 		to support my children and to support the children of my brother and sister too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that i think children without support are really they're missing out a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah my you know when when i was growing up my i i played high school sports
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my dad rarely missed a football game my mom mom and dad both but mostly my dad rarely missed a football game or a basketball game even if we had to travel away from the local area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he would always go and uh i remember that and i'll never forget that you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh and it
 		well it obviously made a really good impression on you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		and that's something that i'd sure like to do with my kids when they
 	
 	
 		yeah well i agree i'm i'm even considering putting my son at two in a tumbling class
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know going and maybe staying with him during most of the class and then going to see what he does and all that
 		because i really i think it's important for children to be around children but i also think it's important for there to be a tight nucleus at home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i'm
 		trying to think of what else what was the other part of the topic
 	
 	
 		um trends and uh
 	
 	
 		trends
 	
 	
 		we've talked about trends um you're you're talking about your family does your do you find your husband has a hard time spending time with the child
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it's tough isn't it i sure have a hard time see i still at work now
 	
 	
 		well
 		oh are you
 	
 	
 		yes it's uh it is sure tough for me
 	
 	
 		well he
 		he has a tendency um
 		to leave it to me since i'm with him all day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's really hard for me to let go too
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		i feel very attached to my son and i i'm sure it would change if i had another one
 		but um
 		i just don't think that
 		i don't know i i don't see much of a change happening there i wish they would spend more time together
 		but
 	
 	
 		yeah what line of business is he in
 	
 	
 		we'll uh we'll see how that goes
 		he's um a scientist with TI
 	
 	
 		hum
 		So he's part of the study here then almost isn't he
 	
 	
 		well it's um it's not the speech study but it's a different kind of study i mean he he works
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in uh laser he's a laser physicist
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's a completely different line of work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		than uh than the speech program but
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		anyhow
 	
 	
 		well i i'm an accountant and i know it takes it's it takes a lot of lot of time away from the home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so uh i just don't i the only time i get a lot of time with my kids is when
