 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um have you ever had to put one a a family member in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		no but we're getting pretty close to it my wife's uh uh stepfather uh is in the hospital right now and hopefully we can pull him out uh back home but we don't know yet
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well my mom is sixty five and she's which i feel is you know quite young still but she's not in the greatest of health and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so recently she has been talking a lot about what we would do if we had to put her in a nursing home
 		she's adamant that she does not want to live with any of her children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and put that burden on us
 	
 	
 		yeah so so is uh so is our uh my  my uh my mother's parents
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my family my mother mother and daddy are dead
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but their parents are still alive oh my goodness wow  oh
 	
 	
 		um-hum eighty four and eighty
 		
 
 		yeah see eighty four one eighty four year old man that's in the hospital
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh we've been looking into it and uh course nursing homes i think uh you would find that uh you would want uh one close to home
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and one that has a pleasant surrounding
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and one that has good staff that uh you know will take care of you and treat you you know like a a like an individual
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and look after your every needs i know down here in Texas we've had a lot of problems with nursing homes that uh that don't uh take care of their people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they've gone in they've closed down a lot of them and they put new regulations on some of them
 		you go in you find an old person with a bed sore because they haven't been turned or haven't been cleaned
 	
 	
 		oh oh dear
 	
 	
 		so uh all of that uh you know i think someone needs to know uh about uh the qualifications of a nursing home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the staff
 	
 	
 		now  how do you go about finding out things like that you
 	
 	
 		well let's assume that uh you wanted to take your mother to a uh nursing home there locally in Ogden i'm sure you've got some that's close by
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it would it what would be real nice is find one around the corner that you could visit that you could go in and uh talk to the people talk to some of the people's uh uh siblings
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 		oh that's right
 	
 	
 		or uh you know children children and uh find out how they like it you know course one of the most important things is is uh can you afford it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh down in some small cities here in Texas it's about fifteen hundred dollars a month over here in Dallas it's closer to three thousand if you really wanna get super care you know you can pay anything you want to
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		oh my
 		
 
 	
 	
 		course we haven't even mentioned Medicaid uh which and uh which uh would take care of an individual who is destitute
 	
 	
 		boy
 		well
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and course there's a lot to be said about uh making a member destitute
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		as opposed to uh paying for it yourself because the government you know uh provides for a destitute person
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's what my mom's been saying you know she's been just saving her money and not paying a penny of it
 		but she says my little bit of savings will probably pay for a nursing home for maybe a year and then i'll be on Medicaid anyway so she said
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		why don't i go out and and enjoy life while i can
 		and you know  when i get to that point of being in a nursing home then maybe Medicaid will just have to take care of me but why don't i just enjoy life now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well yeah and that's true because uh after the year's gone all of her savings are going to be eaten up and if she owns her house uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure about the total rules on the house but i assume that you'd have to sell the house and those proceeds would go to pay for the nursing home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think so
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and anyway it's while it's unlawful
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		there's nothing wrong with a parent gifting everything she has to uh to
 		uh to an individual like uh like like you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then uh from there on out uh saving that money uh so that uh you could supplement her income after she goes under Medicaid
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		a lot of people do that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and most one of the most important things uh about sending a person to uh the nursing home is is the burial provided for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		see that should be provided for before she ever goes out of her monies or otherwise you know the the uh the uh the kids have to provide that
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh you know i sure you've thought of all this
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's
 		it's kind of a sad thing to think about isn't it
 	
 	
 		oh yes it's very sad we had a discussion with her mother who is uh is eighty years old this past weekend and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		
 
 		hm
