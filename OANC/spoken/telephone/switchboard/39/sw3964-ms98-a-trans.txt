 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well Liz do you own a boat
 	
 	
 		well my family has a has a sailboat and we haven't actually been out in in it in a while um but we do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um where do you sail at
 	
 	
 		there's a lake uh right at by our airport here in Dallas and uh Lake Grapevine
 		and um actually i have not done much sailing i had uh
 		i would i have crewed in it
 		but i've never really gotten to where i feel comfortable you know doing the whole thing myself and had
 		all kinds of plans to go out and take lessons and do it and uh
 		for a while there we had flooded lakes and didn't have a chance to so i haven't done that yet
 	
 	
 		how how large is your boat
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to remember uh probably uh
 		i really can't remember
 		uh it's a boat that my sister and i had told
 		my father who's in his seventies we had said you know maybe
 		uh it would be nice maybe sometime we'd like to learn more about sailing and um he he who he is the one who loves sailing and he's the one who's been in it
 		and he just went out and bought a boat uh we didn't mean it that seriously so he went out and bought one he is not fun to sail with it is always a crisis and so um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he turned me off against it when i was young and then later different men men that i have known have had boats and and they made it fun
 		but um he doesn't
 	
 	
 		that's too bad we've got we've got a boat it isn't a sail boat my i should say my family does also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a fishing and ski boat it'll hold about seven people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but we have a lot of fun uh every year we get together for a a week down on a place uh it's uh it's kind of a resort we have a time share down there and take the boat and
 		water ski and and go fishing early in the mornings when the water's cold and
 	
 	
 		oh i bet that's fun
 	
 	
 		it's a lot of fun and even the little kids uh enjoy it i've got
 		uh a six year old and and of course some of the other family has some around eight or ten and we have a great big oh it'll hold about probably five or six kids that size it's a big
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kind of like a a a water weenie that floats in the water and they can all get on it at once
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh how fun
 	
 	
 		and they just have a blast we put a a life jacket on everybody and then you know just pull them around and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh we burn up a tank or two of gas a day
 		and get a really good sunburn  and just have a great time
 	
 	
 		i bet
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		but my experience with boating and at at least that way i don't know the sailing might be different i i don't know i think i'd kind of be too impatient to uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to sail but uh i don't know it might be kind of fun too just to
 		uh relax and i guess it's all wind powered isn't it when you sail
 	
 	
 		it is uh you you can have a motor on it and and a lot of them do i uh just because if you get out there and there's no wind it's pretty hard to get back
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i find it very relaxing i i think they're they're absolutely beautiful i you know i really as i say would like to learn to do it myself just got turned off early on by
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		a particular manner but um it's a wonderful feeling my son and and and can sail and he and i have gone out
 		but he likes to cut it right right to the  when you're going along with the wind you you you can get you can decide how much you want to heel and he loves to take it as far over as possible
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i find that
 	
 	
 		so that's additional speed when you're is that what you
 	
 	
 		yeah the closer to the wind you are
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then you've seen sailboats out where they're just way over
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and that's they're just moving right on out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh that's his favorite way um even to the point where you've got to have someone on the up side you know putting some weight on there so you don't go over
 	
 	
 		i see and you always get to be the one that's hanging over the edge
 	
 	
 		well you know i mean since he's doing the other there you know where am i supposed to go so that that is not my favorite but um a friend who um i dated um years back uh and and i would go out and that was just wonderful you'd
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know take some take a picnic and and go out and you can go in little coves and and
 		it's so quiet it's it that that's something i love i mean i i like ski boats too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and the speed and you know going around but there's something extremely peaceful about a sail boat
 	
 	
 		well do you just drop an anchor when you find a place or do you just kind of let it go and you do take an anchor then and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah drop an anchor and you know there've been the times when the anchor catches in something and you get
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		spend a lot of time yeah trying to get it back up et cetera but uh
 	
 	
 		cut the rope huh
 		how how large is your boat how many how many people could go on it at once
 	
 	
 		um really comfortably about four adults
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		are are they set up so you can spend the night in them and
 	
 	
 		well not this one but but some are there's so many
