 
     		
 	
 		you stand on gun control
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		i don't know i don't use guns i mean and i don't you know i i don't have any occasion to i've never been much of a hunter and any of that so
 		i guess i haven't really felt
 		real strongly one way or the other
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		i i did a fair bit of hunting when i was growing up i pretty well haven't in the last uh fifteen or twenty years pretty well given it up so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um now i do have some guns uh uh
 		i enjoy shooting you know for as far as targets and all but i don't particularly enjoy hunting any more i'm not really opposed to it uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i am i am in favor of uh some some form of of gun control
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess i do too i um
 		i think that law that they tried to pass i'm not even sure if they passed it or not the seven uh seven day waiting period
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i think that's a  a reasonable law and i'm not real sure why the NRA was against it um you know it it really didn't
 		the only thing it restricted was that you couldn't pick up the gun right away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i i don't see why you'd oppose it either you know the uh the um
 		for people who want them for legitimate purposes i mean seven days or even even i'd even be in favor of a a yeah thirty days i mean you don't need a gun on short notice
 	
 	
 		yeah seven days shouldn't be a a big a big deal
 		yeah
 		right
 		and if you do you want the gun for  something else other than than shooting target because you can always get a gun to go and shoot you know target with
 	
 	
 		yeah for
 		
 
 		right that's right
 	
 	
 		or you know  even hunt you can borrow a gun to do that  but uh you know if you want it right away you you want it for a different reason than than the legitimate reason for having a gun
 	
 	
 		that's right and yeah and and uh
 		yeah and uh and the automatic some of the automatic weapons that are sold yeah certainly have no purpose other than to
 		uh kill humans you know when you're talking about some of these automatic weapons
 	
 	
 		yeah it yeah and i i wonder about that because the the the sale of automatic weapons because uh
 		i mean how many  how many rounds does it take to kill a deer if
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah you get these twenty and thirty shot rounds
 	
 	
 		if you need thirty shots to kill a deer you should be uh you you should be shooting with a camera  because you're dangerous anyway
 	
 	
 		that's right right yeah that's even worse than the that's worse than the auto wind uh cameras
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		so i yeah i guess we uh we kind of feel the same way about about that i uh it's it's funny because i was over at in McKinney the other day and picking up a dog
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um and i saw some women um
 		practicing you know shooting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh was just was it just outside some place or
 	
 	
 		and
 		just outside yeah out out in the uh range
 		but um i it reminded me of uh you know i was listening to a talk show the other day and and heard that
 		the majority of the accidents that happen or the shooting that happens happens right in the home with somebody that you know
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's true yeah uh and and it's pretty pretty common that it happens with uh
 	
 	
 		misuse of a gun
 	
 	
 		kids too you know the parent think that the guns hidden or that their uh kids won't bother it but then when they're left alone sometimes uh

 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		gun a kid will show it off to a friend and they'll start handling it and pretty soon somebody gets shot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		a lot of that happened and yeah i i don't i don't really see why the NRA would oppose i guess it's because they you know they don't want any any kind of uh of government restrictions on
 	
 	
 		i i  think what they're afraid of is that uh not necessarily  of this one particular law  or about a waiting period but i think they're afraid that once  you know uh
 		you establish one  regulation they're afraid others would get started
 	
 	
 		then it's a lot easier to just keep going from there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		let me
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		let me switch from my  other phone here i i think my hand phone  is going dead here
 	
 	
 		is that your phone or mine
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay can you still hear me  okay yeah i was just shutting the other one down
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you you must've had a cordless
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hello
 		hello hello
 	
 	
 		hello oh know know i don't know who's on that one
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hello
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you there yeah i i'm getting a lot of static i'm not sure what's going on here i switched phones it may be mine um
 	
 	
 		you still there
 		huh
 		well i've i've switched phones so
