 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well the topic is is very apropos to what's going on um how do you feel about our topic
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i feel like uh i do feel like we pay a lot of taxes i don't mind paying a lot of taxes if the taxes taxes are spent well
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but uh i'm not convinced that they're being spent well um
 	
 	
 		um i think that's because uh it's like i told someone the other day i'm a housewife and uh among uh working mother too and i know how it is to live on a budget and i hear what you're saying
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know our taxes it's nice to see them spent for things that benefit the community but when we see them wasted that's when we think we're paying too much
 	
 	
 		well i feel i i mean one of the things is when it's it it's not going it's going into a lot of military stuff which is badly spent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and not going into a lot of infrastructure things uh or or um you know social needs
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that that it could i mean when you look at the pie it's uh where our money is spent it's it's uh very very um skewed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so i don't feel like i i just don't feel like they're doing what i would do with it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think uh in a way that's that's uh almost off our topic in you know in that uh they didn't want us to talk about how it was spent but i don't think you can separate it
 		i know um i felt very fortunate once when i talked with a lady from England and she said their taxes are at least fifty percent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh in talking to people i've met from other places uh we do seem to get off light
 		except you know if you ever make money one year now you pay all this horrible taxes and you don't get to keep any of it
 	
 	
 		well uh but the people who pay a lot of taxes also get a lot of services they have national health
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		so you know uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		in other words yes that's why i say
 	
 	
 		in the other countries
 	
 	
 		yeah so i'm saying if we did i wouldn't mind paying what we pay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or even more if i got a lot of stuff back for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well on national health so many of them can't use it they say because they never can get in to see their doctors
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		at least in England
 	
 	
 		i we hear that here uh some although we get some people who obviously don't want it like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		like rich doctors
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		who who'd rather us not have it i think but i don't know i i just and local taxes um i think are probably
 		just about the same you know the school the school taxes and all of that income of course is not a a topic in in Texas yet but i'm sure it's coming
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i hope it doesn't i uh i hope not but i don't see any way out of it unless we start cutting some spending drastically
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no
 		that's true i've lived in uh states where they had income tax and you you know and you just get used to it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh again again um
 		it just depends on what they're what it's being spent on
 	
 	
 		of course i i think the sales tax is about the most equitable tax there is
 		because if you don't uh buy and participate you don't have to have to pay it
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh that way people who use the facilities and live outside of the area basically help pay some of the upkeep for it
 	
 	
 		yeah and sometimes and sometimes i think it does work that way um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but they you know uh
 		uh again it's it's you you you have the different kind of taxes then then then what are they being used for and who is deciding what they are being used for
 	
 	
 		and how much is spent to administrate administrate them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		all those people are doing those things and and and i know that the stories i mean i personally know people who have been in this place where you know they they're having trouble paying their taxes and they
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh like you would with a bank you know go into the IRS and say you know you can you can do all this stuff to me and get nothing or give me you know let me pay this out and you'll get it all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they'll say no you know and i think now wait a minute that was my money you said no with well well well you're not going to get it all uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 		yeah and and one of the things that makes it so hard on these people they slap so much penalty and interest on it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that they can triple it in nothing flat
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it's the one place that there's no recourse at all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a lot of people aren't trying to get out of it but trying to figure a way to live and pay it back
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they just they don't accept that at all so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
