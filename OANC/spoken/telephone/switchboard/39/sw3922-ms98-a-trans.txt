 		oh
 	
 	
 		anyway we're supposed to be discussing clothing right  um
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 		at work i guess um i work for TI
 	
 	
 		yeah where do you work
 		oh you work for TI oh okay
 	
 	
 		and um it's pretty casual i mean it can be pretty casual it seems like um  well with our weather that we have here in Texas that um
 		you can usually get about three seasons out of clothing the the only stuff is sometimes i get more casual during the summer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it doesn't last you know past Labor Day or i mean or what is the the one in the fall
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i know what you mean right yeah i uh well i work for Lomas Mortgage and um
 	
 	
 		you know you know what i mean like white shoes and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		our office is so cold i usually try to wear i wear suits most of the time except on Friday we have casual day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean we can wear jeans i'm not a jeans wearer but i wear pants  but um a lot of people in the office dress fairly casual most of the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and do your suits carry you through all four seasons or do you have lighter suits that you wear
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh they do carry me through yes uh most of them i can wear all year i just you know i just buy the
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		they're um  Leslie Fay makes a haberdashery and um i can even wash them in my washing machine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		yeah and um so they're not too heavy for
 		summer or winter or just anytime so i i'd usually buy maybe a lighter color you know like for the summer then i won't wear the real light ones in the winter but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		hm um well i know that like my husband wears suits all year long but you know the men's suits seem to come in different weights like tropical weight or
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know uh i mean he wears wool in the summer but it's a lighter weight and it it it is uh a lot thinner so it breathes better than a a polyester would
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the wool does and and i wear suits occasionally at work at but a lot of it depends on
 		what what i've got going like if i've if i'm gonna be meeting with customers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then uh you know get all dolled up or what not dolled up but you know what i mean um but if i'm just gonna be sitting at my desk all day then
 	
 	
 		yeah all right yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't um you know dress up as much and it it depends on what kind of meetings i have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um fortunately TI is flexible enough that um you know i can do that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh yeah that makes it nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		although right now i'm having more difficulty finding things to wear i'm expecting and and uh
 	
 	
 		oh you are well congratulations
 	
 	
 		i'm in that thank you i'm in that in between stage where where not showing enough to wear maternity clothes but
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh my old clothes are getting kind of tight so so i've started um uh one friend mine at work lent me a bunch of units
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		stuff you know and yeah so that'll be great to wear you know units pants with the sweaters so fortunately TI is flexible enough that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's nice
 		uh
 	
 	
 		you know we can dress kind of casual like that although i get i get tired of it you know and i don't have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i had jeans and i can i used to wear on Fridays i think i've
 		Friday has been my casual day since probably high school even through college it was just kind of ingrained in me that Friday was always a kind of a casual day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i do that even at work it's more it if i do wear jeans that might be the day that i wear them
