 
     		
 	
 		Mike the subject is almost laughable is there such a thing as an honest politician
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's uh debatable if if you read the paper every day  looks like there's a new scandal breaking ever ever minute uh
 	
 	
 		oh i agree with you
 		it's amazing Will Rogers who was in the twenties and thirties if you hear the guy that gimmicks him and uses his same material it is pertinent today as it was then
 	
 	
 		yeah it is that guy that does the traveling show that's that's on Broadway and everything now
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah that's supposed to be great i don't know as long as there lawyers making up the majority of the state legislatures and the national Congress uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't see a lot of change happening
 	
 	
 		attorneys yeah did you catch that the defensive driving course you can take to get out of a ticket was recently changed from two years to once every twelve months
 		it was also noted in some journal that the percentage of ownership of the driving schools by legislatures has greatly increased
 	
 	
 		isn't that funny how that just happens to be a correlation
 	
 	
 		yes yes they're not down there to to live off the salary of uh what they're paid
 	
 	
 		i'm afraid not unfortunately
 	
 	
 		and course you know the  the famous joke is Japan does so good in business because they only let ten attorneys a year graduate each year and that's if fifteen had died the year before and
 	
 	
 		right i saw a
 		a lawyer joke book the other day and it and the title of the joke was skid marks  and of course there's a major joke about skid marks and lawyers
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know it just it's pretty disgusting every time you
 		it it's not just the unethical part of it it's the self-serving part of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		that bothers me about the politicians they're all out
 		either for a particular controlled interest group of some kind or maybe several uh and rather than really honestly decide issues on the basis of what is good for the country
 		everybody decides them with this the constituency in mind or or afraid that they're gonna hack off the wrong group or the other vote wise
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and won't get reelected
 	
 	
 		and yeah exactly and so we if we just limited terms senators especially
 	
 	
 		i agree with you a hundred percent
 	
 	
 		and even Supreme Court judges this appointing them for life is just absurd they wind up senile old men making decisions at eighty years old
 	
 	
 		oh i think all the way
 		uh
 		all the way down to dog catchers of the city yes sir limited turn
 	
 	
 		just just say that the most you can serve is a couple of terms and then get in there and then you could get in there and do the best possible job that you really feel like you should be doing and then you're out of there and go on to something else instead of this
 	
 	
 		two two
 		um-hum um-hum
 		you go to  you know get elected to another office and let somebody else pay you
 	
 	
 		because this exactly well at least you'd decide things you'd decide things from the stand point of what's best hopefully for whatever agency you're representing
 	
 	
 		uh you seen the benefits that
 		yeah
 		the benefits legislatures uh state and senate and uh
 		and legislatures in Warshin get after they've been there a few terms is unbelievable they get their salary for life health benefits for life
 	
 	
 		yeah i know
 	
 	
 		oh uh uh have have you ever noticed when
 	
 	
 		i just i just think we ought to we limit the President why not terms of the others and give there's plenty of other qualified people to run
 	
 	
 		what
 		right
 		they tried that in in Washington or was it or Oregon
 		but speaker of the house was from there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if approved it he would not have been eligible to continue representing and being speaker
 		and so the voters voters kicked it said no we we since we're the one with the with the gun right now we're not gonna vote out having the gun control having the power
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so when i i don't LBJ's a perfect example of how somebody can be broke and get into politics and come out rich as yeah
 	
 	
 		that's right and above nothing either  starting with Duvall County
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		well they they used to say in advertising that the textbook example of good competitive advertising advertising is Hertz and Avis rent a car commercials number one number two i guess LBJ has to be a textbook example of politician without any morals
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah that's that's probably true
 	
 	
 		i don't think one of the question question was could they legislate laws to keep politicians honest my opinion no because they won't pass laws against themselves
 	
 	
 		i haven't
 		yeah i don't
 		well that's it when the very people making the laws are gonna be the ones who would have to pass those uh against themselves it it sort of uh
 		goes without saying that it'd be awfully awfully tough unless you could get the best thing that could happen uh to the state legislatures would be to be full of just
 		independent independent independent businessmen or just businessmen working for companies that could somehow get their salary made
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		let them
 	
 	
 		uh  justified you know or brought up to whatever over the state salary level uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
