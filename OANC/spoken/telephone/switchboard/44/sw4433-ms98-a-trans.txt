 
     		
 	
 		is crime a problem in Arlington
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh actually we live out in Gainesville Virginia and uh my wife is originally from the Bronx
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so for the longest time we didn't have any any kind of crime protection on our house at all because we lived way out in the country here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh then you know over the years we visited her folks and her folks have probably the most impressive crime reduction system i've ever seen on any house you know they have grates across every single window
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they have probably three or four dead bolts on every door
 		um just uh an amazing array of um you know sort of security measures on their house i mean it's harder to get into their house than it is probably  a lot of minimum security prisons
 	
 	
 		well huh
 	
 	
 		so anyway now she's turning our house into sort of the same thing  we have uh we have like grates on the on the uh door on the basement windows even though there's very little crime in this area
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we just had a a guy come out a locksmith come out and put all those on as well as sort of reinforce all of our dead bolts and uh put new locks in on some doors and fix our French doors up so that they were
 		you know secure
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's too bad you mentioned uh your in-laws place as as being like a prison in sense of hard to get into or out of or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's what crime is doing in the cities it's turning those that live in the cities into prisoners
 	
 	
 		yeah what's it like in Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh actually i'm in a suburb of Dallas where it's
 		safer in general than it is in the big city
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it um
 		i think it's like most cities and that is the high crime areas are the
 		ones where there's more poverty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the you know that  there's always one part of town
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh whether it's the Bronx or whether it's a certain area in Dallas or whatever
 		uh
 		i i think that's where the crime is concentrated but gosh we just there was just one over in Fort Worth a woman was killed and her husband was uh badly injured
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they've charged the uh the husband's daughter
 		with hiring two of her teenage friends to kill her
 	
 	
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		dad and stuff yeah
 	
 	
 		man incredible
 	
 	
 		isn't that incredible and i mean uh that that's crime that's
 		that you don't usually think about i mean you if you if you're going to carry on a conversation about crime you know you think of the hardened criminal that keeps
 		uh
 		attacking attacking again and again if you will whether you know depending on what his game is maybe it's an armed robber who does it all the time but this is uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah it's clearly i i mean it's they're not in category of business criminals i mean there's
 		there's criminals who are in it just because that's their business you know  i mean that's their trade essentially and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know then there's then there's the really random acts of violence we actually had a a woman who was very close to our house which sort of inspired my wife to you know beef up our own security measures here
 		uh she was a couple of houses away and her husband travels a lot and is gone you know for weeks on end
 		and she was upstairs with her uh child and heard somebody say hello hello from downstairs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so she immediately calls 911
 		and the Prince William County police come over and of course the woman kept her on the phone the whole time which i thought was a really good security measure because
 		you know if you can get 911 Gainesville Virginia you know  you're probably you know i mean it's probably a pretty effective thing you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um so anyway the police showed up and they told her the person on the phone told her to run you know take the child and run downstairs and to let the police in because they were at her front door
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so she did that and when she opened the front door she'd just bought this new German Shepherd puppy which had apparently you know uh gone all over the floor
 		so the the policeman stepped into the front door and actually started sliding around on you know the dog mess
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and she yelled simultaneously yelled look out
 		which the policeman thought was like somebody's about to shoot me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you know he's like spinning around in this stuff you know i mean it's a pretty comical scene but anyway when the guy finally regained his balance you know he just like get out of house lady and stop trying to help me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but anyway later on it's it's gonna it's uh she they didn't find anything i mean apparently you know if the guy came in he ran out and and the police tried to convince her that it was the dog playing with the remote control on the TV which just doesn't make any sense at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		too the odds of that are just really unlikely but i actually went over
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		about a week later he was back home and she was on travel and he locked himself out and i went over and within i would say about five seconds got into their garage door
 	
 	
 		oh ho
