 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh so where do you stand on gun control
 	
 	
 		where do i stand well if uh if ten means absolutely no control i don't think i'd buy that but i guess i'd be maybe a six
 		i think that we probably should have a right to own guns if we're responsible
 		uh
 		i myself own one i shoot nothing but paper targets
 		but i don't think anybody has the right to tell me i can't possess one i don't think
 		uh if i'm responsible my kids can't get a hold of them
 		and i certainly wouldn't use them for a crime i think the people who do use them for crime aren't the people who bother to get a a license
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh what are your feelings
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm more in favor of of uh restricting them but um as far as getting a number it's a little hard but
 	
 	
 		yeah i it it is a uh
 		just picking it out of a hat um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but do you feel that no one should be able to own any
 	
 	
 		no no no cause people like to hunt and
 		and some you know in some cases i think it's it's a good um i mean it's a valid reason to have one for defense
 		although you know the statistics about
 		uh accidents
 		uh it's kind of
 		uh worrisome i mean i wouldn't
 		i know i don't like the idea of having guns around a lot because
 		they're mostly used i mean to they cause a lot of accidents they there are a lot of accidents because of them being so handy
 	
 	
 		okay well i don't know what the laws are in your state uh in order to get a license
 		i was uh thoroughly checked out it took over seven months to get myself approved
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um you need all kinds of references you need they check your criminal record and all this other stuff uh they restrict
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		um when you can carry it you can just take it to a range and back home again if you want to hunt you need a special hunting license
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um i myself am no fool i didn't want to hurt myself why would anybody want to take a chance it is a dangerous thing i took a uh National Rifle Association course on
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		how to uh handle one i keep it locked i keep the bullets somewhere else
 		um i personally feel that if someone came into my house i'd be too much of a nervous wreck to shoot them accurately and i wouldn't want to hit my kids in case they were wandering around so i really have no
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		no thought to use it for protection i you know i'm more more of the notion that a bad guy is meaner than i am and would use it against me
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um i think the guns that are out there hurting people are held by irresponsible people um i don't believe that there should be
 		that you should be able to walk into your local supermarket and buy one i mean any bozo could get one then and then it would be indeed scary
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i you know i just like the sport of shooting at a target it's the kind it's sort of like weight lifting it's something that you can judge yourself against yourself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i i i agree that the thought of actually putting a bullet into flesh is really revolting i mean i personally can't even see hunting you know i have no use for Bambi there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's it's kind of brutal
 	
 	
 		right but i mean we we get hamburger in a package and then we end up we forget it came from an animal but i choose to forget i'm a hypocrite myself
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		what what would you think of the notion of you know just taking up a gun for target practice if you were trained does does that revolt you in any way
 	
 	
 		no i've i've actually done that with a friend of mine with his gun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and he
 	
 	
 		did you feel unsafe
 	
 	
 		no no the uh
 		the thing is if when if i have one handy though then
 		if i'm
 		or i can imagine somebody being outraged at something and saying uh i just i want to go for the gun i know where it is it's easy and then
 	
 	
 		then it's too late
 	
 	
 		pulling the trigger is so easy that uh
 		well
 	
 	
 		well you know it i think it's it it i think
 		uh you talk to someone else they say yeah i think everybody should have a gun i should have a gun and nobody else should because i know i would act responsibly but you you never know about the other guy and i think that's part of the reason why people are are so fearful
 	
 	
 		right
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because it's true someone might get drunk and not think
 		um
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you know i don't believe in no laws i think that would be a scary kind of thing
 		but well that's how i feel
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh in Massachusetts
 		they uh they have uh
 		uh
