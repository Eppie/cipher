 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um anyway we're supposed talk about recycling basically what what your personal opinion is on it uh this is this is really for a speech research project they're doing
 		so um i don't know Florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it
 	
 	
 		well they just kicked it off down here in in Sarasota county um
 	
 	
 		oh they did
 	
 	
 		they had been doing it they started first in Sarasota City um you know which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually and um they've got these i don't know what if you're familiar with Sarasota county at all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		not quite no
 	
 	
 		they've got these on it's it's county wide program now and what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage uh yard trash
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		plastic cans cans and glass
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and then uh paper
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		which in the paper it's just um newspaper and corrugated cardboard is the only thing you're supposed to put in there no slicks um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay
 		oh that's that's good let me ask you this do they require you to presort it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay see that's something in Minneapolis they're really strict on in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really
 		you know tightly but when i lived in Orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there and they'd just sort it out for you  it was really pretty good if you're lazy like i am so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah right well you know um i talked to this girl who um she's a an  an acquaintance of mine and and she's involved with uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh what is the name of that company it's not Amway but it's the other big vitamin company Shaklee
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah
 	
 	
 		okay and um and and she's just Shaklee crazy you know because it's her business and everything and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and she asked we were talking one day and and she asked me a couple of questions you know and she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one
 		they don't want it to change their lifestyle and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything which that's that's what recycling at home sorting does you know i mean it's a little extra work and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do what they do here in Sarasota county is they've got
 	
 	
 		it can yeah
 	
 	
 		okay you put your garbage in a garbage bag and you set it out by the curb if you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub and it's about a foot and a half deep and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long
 	
 	
 		yeah you got to tie them up and everything and
 		right
 	
 	
 		this is a little container and they have another one the same size that one's red and then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so like
 		you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans otherwise you got bees and ants and you know and and if you've got uh food containers or anything like that it's a big problem so not only do you
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		it is you know big hassle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true i mean up here they give you one one of those containers and you put everything in it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it's like if if you use a lot of stuff you it's like well you know let's say if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's gonna be hard pressed to pressed to put all your recyclables in that one place you know so it's kind of a pain in the butt
 	
 	
 		this is true this is true
 	
 	
 		but um i don't know that's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know have have those garbage people that make how every many make twenty twenty or thirty bucks an hour have them do a little bit of the sorting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and and maybe come up with a better system make it a little more convenient
 		but i
 	
 	
 		yeah they've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here um if you wanna have a nice garbage can you know and it's on wheels and it's big
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh you can actually rent those
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay that's interesting yeah up here the the city provides them kind of like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think in i think in the city they do but out here in the county you have to rent them
 	
 	
 		oh okay so
 	
 	
 		and they just add it on to your water bill or something
 	
 	
 		so where exactly are you in terms of of like Sarasota are you north of Sarasota or
 	
 	
 		east of Sarasota um-hum
 	
 	
 		east okay and Sarasota is on the west coast
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay like south of Tampa right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay i'm
 	
 	
 		yeah about an hour about an hour south of Tampa
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um  yeah well i i listen to this talk radio station down here and it's it's really they they i don't if you ever listen to talk radio but
 	
 	
 		um occasionally
 	
 	
 		those guys they just kind of get into
 		to stewing stewing stewing up trouble you know with the callers and things like that but they get into some really good conversations sometimes you know and some of it sometimes it's serious and they have some good feedback and all that stuff and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm listening to that i kind of got an idea that i thought would be good was and this kind of fits into the uh the aid program the welfare program that's going on right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's like um
