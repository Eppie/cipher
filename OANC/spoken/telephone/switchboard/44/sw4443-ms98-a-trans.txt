 
     		
 	
 		play
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i uh consider myself a hacker how about you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well i'm into it uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i'm not as good as i'd like to be but it's a
 	
 	
 		is anybody
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so um i started playing when i was in elementary school actually we lived really close to a par three golf course and i'd go up there with friends after school a couple times every week and then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		for uh for years i don't know after elementary school all through junior high and stuff i didn't play because i think i just got so frustrated when i was little i'd my body wasn't you know physically developed and all that kind of stuff and then i'd started started started picking it up again a couple of years back and i've really been enjoying it
 	
 	
 		right
 		super yeah that's kind of the way i did it too actually i i played uh just a tiny bit when i was real young and then uh i went i got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but and then quit for awhile and recently i picked it up like you say about a couple years ago and uh i've been playing you know off and on when i can up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course but
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i actually live in Florida so uh uh i'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right the the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf
 	
 	
 		i was going to say
 	
 	
 		i mean it's a great game but i mean to play a really nice course you've got to have a really big wallet  i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's true all too many times
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		fortunately uh down where i live in Florida there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um one of them is the University of Florida golf course which is open to the public and that's pretty pretty good
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i uh attend Indiana University and it's the same way here they have a really nice championship style course that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is fairly reasonable to play on
 	
 	
 		can you get like a a student discount type of thing or
 	
 	
 		uh a little bit but not a whole lot i mean i you'd think you would but uh you don't so i
 	
 	
 		yeah what uh what uh what are greens fees run there
 	
 	
 		uh well they range from anywhere from about five bucks for uh your basic city type course up to fifty sixty dollars for a really really nice course
 	
 	
 		okay that's yeah that's about the same i guess as it is in Florida but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh my dad is a member of a golf club over in my home town and i can play for free there and it's a pretty nice course
 	
 	
 		really oh that's super
 	
 	
 		yeah and i guess it well it's free for me  yeah somebody's paying but
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		not me
 	
 	
 		well that's the way to do it though that's the way to get in to some good practice without having to pay for it all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah definitely as far as watching golf i mean i can watch it on TV but it's kind of boring it's nice to see those who guys they have such good style that uh it's uh  it's pretty fun to watch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		they need to get a new photography method because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball  that's that's a little difficult i mean it they do they do a generally okay job but like you said it's it's kind of boring actually
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		uh-huh what i really uh i uh had a chance they had the PGA tournament up in Indianapolis last year i was able to go and see one of the rounds of that and that was really fun
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah i bet that would be great
 	
 	
 		i mean you knew it yeah i never really thought it was would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch but man it was it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them play
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i've never been to a tournament uh you know looking at it on TV you you thinking man  what a boring thing you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh that's that's wild though i'll have to see if i can't get a a chance to go
 	
 	
 		you got
 		i mean it's uh it's a lot more exciting than actually watching watching than watching it on TV and if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around i mean it's just
 		watching them the whole time instead of like on TV you get to see them make a tee shot and then they go off to some other hole and they come back when they're putting but you know it's really something else
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		yeah i can imagine  what do you do for a living
 	
 	
 		uh i'm a student right now
 	
 	
 		oh you are which uh which university
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		at uh Indiana University
 	
 	
 		okay all right great what are you going into
 	
 	
 		uh i don't really know i'm a math computer science major right now
 	
 	
 		okay definitely not golf right
 	
 	
 		no i wish it'd be nice to be a pro golfer i mean it seems like that that would be an okay life just to hang out and
 	
 	
 		yeah if you're good you can really rake in the bucks what was that what was that movie that they had out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there there was a movie about a professional golfer and i i can't remember it was on network TV a couple times
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well you know you it seems like well you go to work every weekend play maybe one two tournaments a month and come in about tenth you'd still be doing pretty well
 	
 	
 		that's right you got to take it easy   yeah that's a good thing
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah i guess when i get back i'm going to school in Florida actually um and fortunately i've been able to to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful you know but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's it's unfortunate you know you hear about Japan i guess you know it's it's like
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		two hundred and fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to like to practice even insane
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and those fees to join a club like a million dollars or whatever is just that is out of control
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean you'd really want to really be liking your golf
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess they have those uh driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of each other
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw one of those on TV that is pretty wild
 	
 	
 		they do yeah yeah i yeah i played uh uh eighteen holes with some Japanese guys in in Gainesville as a matter of fact
 		and it was really wild they were into it you know they kicked our butt all the way to
 	
 	
 		yeah
