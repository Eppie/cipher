 
     		
 	
 		i haven't done any camping lately how about you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh not recently we we've done a little bit of car camping  uh since since i got married and did a little bit of backpacking several years ago but uh not recently
 	
 	
 		were these extended trips or just a weekend or
 	
 	
 		well not real long maybe three four days at the most how about you
 	
 	
 		uh that's about what i've done but it goes back even further to my childhood camping went out camping and and the purpose was not to camp the purpose was to fish
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there were no motels in in the wilds of New Mexico
 		so if you wanted to go fish for a few days you would uh and at certain lakes that were definitely off the beaten track you would do what you i think what you call car camping
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean the car's there and and you may or may not sleep on a cot outside of it or inside the car or
 		but uh nothing too elaborate in the way of tents and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've actually even slept on the ground
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've done a little bit of that too um i guess i've kind of done the full range of camping anywhere from backpacking in the mountains for
 		for a week at a time to the the car camping kind of thing
 	
 	
 		where did you do your backpacking
 	
 	
 		well i've done some down in um Tennessee and Kentucky that area North Carolina and then done some in New Mexico
 		and some out in Montana Colorado
 		so i've kind of gone around and done it number of places
 	
 	
 		but this was in years past or yeah
 	
 	
 		right
 		i used to work at um summer camps um a lot when i was in high school and college and i worked at some summer camps in New Mexico where um
 		the emphasis there was on backpacking exclusively
 	
 	
 		around Philmont or something
 	
 	
 		right um-hum you've been there
 	
 	
 		no i haven't no but every Boy Scout i've ever known has camped at Philmont
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah well it's a very popular place and i worked there  three summers so  got to know it pretty well
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess i don't know do you think it's it's as safe as it used to be to go camping
 	
 	
 		well probably the biggest concern that i would have now is getting safe drinking water um
 		cause a lot of times we'd just pull water out of a stream and um use that and i was never really big on using a lot of chemicals for water purification and treatment um
 		and nowadays i think i'd be a little bit more cautious about that than i used to be
 	
 	
 		yeah when when i was in growing up in New Mexico if we went on a picnic or whatever it was always in the mountains we lived in the southwestern corner of the state so we could go to the mountains or the desert
 		just pick a place and if you were needed water the you'd find a stream and drink right out of the stream
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when i left New Mexico and moved to Missouri i would not have dreamed  drinking out of any stream that i saw there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i guess partly it depends on on how isolated the river is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh course i i mean even in in New Mexico you always had the possibility of a cow or uh some other critter upstream  a ways from you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um what about crime in camp sites do you think that's a problem
 	
 	
 		well i suppose in some of the real big parks and stuff that could be an issue
 		but generally i haven't ever found that to be a problem usually people are very friendly and
 		um cooperative all the way around so i've never deemed that as a threat to myself but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		been been fairly careful about not leaving tempting things out in the campsite and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah it you hide your fishing gear and your camera and all that sort of stuff don't tempt people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right and usually if i'm backpacking of course there i don't worry about it much at all because if
 		there's something there that they want  they'd have to haul it out a long ways so they usually would think twice about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i have a good friend who goes backpacking about twice a year in the Grand Canyon
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he's he's really uh hung up on that Grand Canyon
 	
 	
 		you know i've had some friends of mine that have made the trip down through there a couple of times they really enjoy it but
 		there's something about going down in a hole that  just um doesn't really relate that strongly to me i suppose i'll try it someday but i always like to climb mountains and get up where i can see something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i think with the case like in the case of the canyon you see more from the rim than you would ever camping down inside of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah are there mountains in Wisconsin for you to go out and climb or
 	
 	
 		well no it's more mostly just some rolling hills so there isn't really much
