 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so what do you think about mandatory public service
 	
 	
 		well um um
 		personally i think it's good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think um
 		there's a lot of things that that um
 		you can learn from
 		helping other people and doing things that need to be done
 		and as i look around i see most of the things that i enjoy like i just got back from vacation and the freeways were were built by somebody else paid by somebody else and
 		and um wouldn't hurt to do some of that myself
 	
 	
 		right were you ever in the military or public service of any kind
 	
 	
 		i i did a two and a half um  two and a half year volunteer um
 		how shall i say it uh service in the Far East for my church
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what denomination
 	
 	
 		uh Latter Day Saint church
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		so it was
 		it was um it was a great uh thing and and i know some other people that who've that have um come back from that and joined the Peace Corps and
 		you know went on uh contributing and and like i say in every case uh they benefited and i'm they have lifelong happy memories about about uh
 		the things that they did now does that mean that everybody is going to have happy memories well  i don't know but in Europe and in many states in Europe they do the same thing they they want everybody to to uh
 		not necessarily join the military military but have you know mandatory uh
 		volunteer service of some kind
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so how about you
 	
 	
 		i think it's also a good idea
 		people that i've i was just thinking this morning about
 		how
 		are you there
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		okay hi um i was just thinking this morning about how people tend to get off into a
 		to one narrow track and one narrow focus and don't get an opportunity to go out and look and experience other people and other ways of doing things
 		so in particular i was thinking about up in lately visiting around to a lot of different congregations and the preachers that i've heard that have just grown up and stayed into one particular denomination
 		are not nearly as good and um expansive as the ones that have come from a different denomination to the one they're in now
 		so in terms of having life experience
 		and a better appreciation for other people and other points of view i think
 		the mandatory volunteer service is a great thing great idea the problem is
 		that as you say not everybody will have a great experience
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the ones that are wanting to do it tend to have great experiences though some of our friends that joined the Peace Corps have been really lonely
 	
 	
 		yeah well well that's part of the how shall i say it that's part of the experience i think because not every
 		oh how shall i say it not every uh
 		not every place we go has has great weather i uh you know sometimes you come back and and you say um that was an interesting trip  but i guess what i'm saying is that that
 		overall the the benefits of of uh volunteer service
 		uh are just infectious they they get you remember the people you helped and it's not all money money money money
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh it's really useful to to making you well like i say feel like you contribute i know after i spent my time in the Far East i came back and i said well
 		of all the bad things i've done in my life and of all the times i wimped out and haven't done anything at least i've done something
 		for that period of time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you know it's um how shall i say it
 		it's not a cure all but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		the other thing that i've that i like i say i feel is that there's a a lot of people out there that that just have tons of time and uh
 		they don't know what they're going to do with their life and and as you pointed out if they've get out and see if uh uh life from a
 		from a different uh perspective
 		then uh  they have a better focus
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and let's see what else
 		i i think the only difficulty is going to be um
 		if it becomes
 		well i think we'd have to learn a lot from the European uh style uh because i know that in America there's
 		sometimes there's a tendency to let everybody do their own thing to the point that that uh it might become
