 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well all right um i i guess i'll start um by mentioning that um being twenty four years old i had a great-grandmother
 		who's still alive at this point who was just recently placed in a nursing home after the death of my great-grandfather
 		and it was a real problem  in doing that because uh she has Alzheimer's
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh she had no wish or desire to go into that kind of facility and uh we were very concerned about uh
 		her long-term care my great-grandfather after he was found out he was going to go into a nursing home uh actually gave up the ghost more or less
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and passed on only only about a week after that
 	
 	
 		well my um
 		my my grandmother is um
 		had Alzheimer's and through the process we had to remove we tried to keep her at home at our we had to remove her from her home because she was getting paranoiac and tried to keep her at our home and
 		did that as long as we could but again the process is very difficult even
 		even you know i think that my parents did a good job at it when when they went through but it's not an easy thing when they've got Alzheimer's but my other grandparents
 		um signed up for a retirement
 		type thing in Pennsylvania um already my father's much older than my mother so
 		well no i guess it anyway my grandparents my other grandparents are much younger and um
 		they what they did is they sold their house and bought a house
 		figuratively speaking in this retirement complex and they live in that house
 		and there there there's minimal because they you know they bought it um they've kind of bought into the whole system and there's there's care given for the lawn and stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and um as they get older more care can be given and there's some minimal fees that they'll always be paying but the basic fee for health care and all that is already taken care of
 		and when they get too old they can move into an apartment instead it's like a duplex they have now
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		they can move into an apartment and then later nursing
 	
 	
 		we had
 		yeah we had up here when they got into uh when my grandmother came over my great-grandmother came over here she actually spent sometime with us and we had to have a nurse come in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because we simply we couldn't handle it she kind of she'd lost all bearings as to where she was and she would actually wander around uh we were afraid she would wander herself into the basement and fall down the stairs or
 		uh you know it was incredible because my great-grandfather had taken care of her and she demanded absolute twenty four hour care she had to be watched she had to be cleaned
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		everything you know it was a demeaning process for my for my grandfather great-grandfather we had never realized how much
 		um how bad she had deteriorated over the uh years i mean i she would forget my name and she would forget you know how to cook or how to take care of herself but we didn't realize the extent
 		until after my great-grandfather had a bad stroke
 		and um um  we had her here and we had to take care of her and it even kind of drove the nurse a little crazy
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what happened to my other my grandmother my grandfather had died and she wanted to stay on and then she got Alzheimer's and it was a really hard thing for the whole family i'm much more appreciative of what my
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my other set of grandparents has done and my parents have already um kind of like gone on a waiting list cause it's such a long thing because it preserves the dignity
 		of the you know the whole situation and it's a decision that my parents have made and it won't be a drain on our resources because it'll mean just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um you know sell selling their house now and buying into that at the same time
 		and it's familiar
 	
 	
 		yeah my my great-grandfather my great-grandfather had found uh my great-grandfather was was was around during the depression so he had actually hidden a lot of money in the house over there
 		and of course you know the moment you go into a nursing home situation they take everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and it was it was terrible and very demeaning he didn't wanna lose the independence and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh that was the biggest problem because we didn't really catch it as early as you seem to have as far as you know planning you know of long-term
 	
 	
 		well we didn't catch it for my first grandmother my first set of grandparents
 		but my other grandparents had apparently it's like a retirement community and they knew a lot of friends who had done the same thing and when they got there
 	
 	
 		yeah
