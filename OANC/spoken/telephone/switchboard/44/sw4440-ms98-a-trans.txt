 
     		
 	
 		okay how you do you have kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i have a uh twelve year old son and a fourteen year old daughter
 	
 	
 		oh they're just teenagers huh almost
 	
 	
 		right  so uh
 		so it's uh an interesting experience for us but we're kind of lucky uh in that regard because uh the church we belong to has a a program that they've had for quite a few years that they call family home evening
 		and that program is designed to uh
 		bring the family together at least once a week on Monday night
 		so we uh i guess i could say religiously
 		dedicate Monday evening to doing just that  and each each week uh each one of us takes uh responsibility for that particular Monday night
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		now now do you find that that that's uh
 		see how would i say that do you find that uh
 		that that it's well i mean it's it's
 	
 	
 		that it works
 	
 	
 		you could do that on a Monday on a Monday do you find it
 		that it's easy to do that on Monday nights or is it
 	
 	
 		um-hum it because it turns out that Monday night of all of the other nights of the week generally is the one that has the least number of other outside influences going on
 		so we find that it works out quite well and
 		uh we actually look forward to it because we get to spend so little time together otherwise
 		and uh as i said each one of us'll plan uh something for the particular Monday and it can be anything  because it is kind of a
 		a church sponsored thing once in a while we'll have a a religious lesson maybe once a month that alternates amongst us but uh we might go to a movie or we might watch something here or play a game or just sit and read or uh
 		or whatever that individual feels that they would like to do
 		that's what we do
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds pretty good are do you find that that uh uh i guess with us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i have uh
 		four kids at home now and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		let's see uh a six a five year old a thirteen year old uh excuse me five eleven thirteen and seventeen
 		and uh
 		
 
 		Saturdays is a is it's difficult to get everybody
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		organized and rounded up uh so they get the chores done and don't home in on the television immediately when they when they get up
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um actually and during the school nights uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh the we have a rule now that that uh because the kids are so easily distracted by the you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh  that uh no television on school nights and no
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum and right not at all or until it's all done or uh
 	
 	
 		none at all
 	
 	
 		not at all that's that's a good but uh that's a good idea but
 	
 	
 		it's well they think it's draconian they think it's terrible you know
 	
 	
 		right yeah  hard to enforce i'm sure
 	
 	
 		uh well no it's not that hard to enforce it's just uh because if there's you know if it's
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		i found out that if
 		if uh
 		if i let one of them watch pretty soon they'd all be watching
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's right including yourself yeah can't let yourself watch either that'll work
 	
 	
 		so i so i said that
 		
 
 		well no television and no ball games and the reason no ball games is because the kids'll stick their earphones on and and listen to ball games and try and do their piano believe it or not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		we have another uh another advantage to is that uh three of the four of us are ham radio operators
 	
 	
 		oh is that that's that's a pretty good hobby isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah so we have a uh a hobby in common and we can talk to one another over the air too on uh on many occasions
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh matter of fact we're my son and i are watching the the shuttle right now uh they've got four ham radio operators on board the shuttle
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh so we been trying to make contact with them and it's uh it's headed towards the DC area right now yeah matter of fact it's uh it's over the horizon now
 	
 	
 		oh is that right that's very nice
 		well now that's kind of that's interesting to me because
 		a lot of uh you know in keeping on the uh the family thing here the reason that's interesting is because i've noticed that some families have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		like the the parent i knew some ham and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		there's a tendency and i i think a lot of it depends on the family for like the ham to go in his in his uh room and shut the door
 	
 	
 		right in the ham shack um hum
 	
 	
 		in a shack and shut the door and the rest of the family was excluded
 	
 	
 		right and that's the last you ever see of him and uh
 	
 	
 		and that's
 	
 	
 		and uh he speaks a totally different language
 	
 	
 		and the fact that and i read one time that uh there was a high divorce rate in in uh
 		Cape Canaveral down there or Cape Kennedy or whatever you call it because the engineer would come home go in his study close the door and that was it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh just sort of an autocrat so the fact that you've got three participants in your family that uh that do that is that's a credit to you what are
 	
 	
 		hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		let's say i i guess my other question about uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		when it comes to when they're on their own
 		you know i mean if if you have to go if you and your wife go someplace
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what typically
