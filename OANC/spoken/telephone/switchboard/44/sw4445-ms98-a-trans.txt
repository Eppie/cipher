 
     		
 	
 		what kind of pollution do you have in Flagstaff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we have the the usual automotive pollution that and although it's not very visible you don't worry about that uh too much uh but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we have a lot of wood smoke
 		uh here now i heat with wood so ah and i'm one of the polluters if you think that wood smoke is a is a source a source of pollution but there are people in this community who
 		who think that uh
 		it's gone beyond the part of being part of the charm of the community to the point of being part of the pollution
 		and
 		and uh we're very close to the uh to the Grand Canyon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where air pollution is a very big issue
 		because on of pollution well it's debatable as to whether it's coming from the Los Angeles area on the jet stream or whether it's coming from the Four Corners power plant up near Page Arizona uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but because it's a national park that's a a big issue there uh  here in Flagstaff actually uh it it's something that's unique to us the the biggest pollutant that we have in our air is cinder dust
 	
 	
 		i'll be darned
 	
 	
 		and that's because uh we're in a volcanic region
 		and we uh we have dirt roads uh in a lot of areas that are covered with with cinders but what they also cinders on the highways in the winter time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in place of uh using salt or substances like that that they might in the eastern part of the country and when the snow goes away and it dries up and the cars drive over it we get a lot of cinder dust kicked up into the air and as of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know the largest the largest quantity that's the biggest pollutants that we have to to deal with here
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i'm sure that cinder dust is pretty unique  um in the Dallas area of course the the biggest issue of air pollution is just automobiles
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh we don't have much in the way of heavy industry i mean this is a center for electronics and banking and insurance and you know businesses like that
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		which are not typically bad polluters
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um
 		so i i'd think you'd have to blame most of it on the automobiles here
 	
 	
 		does does Dallas sits sit in any kind of uh uh i've been there but i don't remember if you sit in any kind of a trough that uh where you get temperature inversions that that capture air pollutants or anything like that
 	
 	
 		we have we yes we occasionally have them not if they're not
 		not not too significant
 		but they do occasionally occasionally occur uh one source of pollution for us is the dust and sand in uh west Texas
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		in the spring time we'll have parts of Lubbock coming to Dallas
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm serious these enormous clouds
 		of sand or dust or whatever you wanna call it
 	
 	
 		i laugh because i made the journey once from El Paso to Dallas and then continuing east uh to the Eastern Coast of the United States and uh i joked that uh all of the settlers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		settled in Eastern Texas where the green rolling hills are and and when they finally beat the Mexicans the Mexicans said fine you can have East Texas but as long as long only as long as you take west Texas too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right i can understand that it's interesting though that you mentioned the uh wood stoves
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i grew up in New Mexico and but that was long enough ago that uh people didn't really heat that much with wood that was sort of a backward way of doing things if you will
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but now in New Mexico heating with with particularly pinon pine is really an issue
 	
 	
 		right and
 	
 	
 		not only from the pollution point of view but it takes many many years to grow those trees
 	
 	
 		yes
 		and
 	
 	
 		and people are chopping them down and heating their houses with them um
 		and it's it's such a distinctive smell when it burns i had forgotten it i mean i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it it's one of those smells you forget but then when you step outside your mother's house you go oop yep somebody's burning pinon
 	
 	
 		here in Flagstaff uh juniper is the the very distinctive smelling wood that you can smell in the wood smoke uh and one of the issues here ah it which gets into forest management but has an impact on on air pollution
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		is that uh we're surrounded by the largest stand of ponderosa pine in the world
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but people don't wanna burn ponderosa pine they wanna burn oak which is very hard to find in this region or juniper because it's the more plentiful hardwood
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		and uh aspen uh it burns very cleanly but doesn't put out a lot of heat uh and and ponderosa
 		we also have pinon but uh it uh it it like ponderosa is very dirty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so they're not preferable woods and so here we have this great abundance of ponderosa pine
 		and the forest service is really saying we really wish that we could find a way to make it uh less of a
