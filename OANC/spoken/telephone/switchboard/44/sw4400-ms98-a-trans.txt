 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah uh do do you uh do any work on your own cars
 	
 	
 		i uh i used to i don't uh much anymore except just change the oil occasionally
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i actually i just uh just recently thought about buying a new car
 		and i went and i saw all the Japanese cars and uh really liked the uh actually the Diamante which is uh sort of the luxury Nissan
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but i i just decided i wasn't gonna get  i wasn't first of all i wasn't gonna get a Japanese car that was about the time that uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that
 	
 	
 		you know all the all the sort of antitrade stuff was going on  and then uh later decided that uh
 		i'd just hang on to my own car which has about two hundred and eighteen thousand miles on it it's a Chevy Celebrity four cylinder
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 		that's very good
 	
 	
 		and i've driven it since uh grad school and uh just decided you know i think i'll hang on to this car you know it's been so good for me for me all this time so
 		uh in fact i got my wife a a used car that was uh also a Chevy Celebrity because
 	
 	
 		you had good luck with that one huh
 	
 	
 		you know i've i had good luck and uh i knew enough about all the the basic maintenance you know brakes oil and that kind of stuff to do it myself so
 	
 	
 		well that's uh i i'd certainly agree with your
 		with your logic there my uh
 		
 
 		uh
 		
 
 		feelings about cars are i'd look under the hood and i see all the um
 		all the stuff under there and i say boy my chances of of doing
 		how shall i say it uh everything's electronic uh  uh it's not that i'd
 		i mean cancel their time it's just that uh there's so much you know you can't and you can't tune it yourself you can't do anything it's because you don't have the the tools to measure it on on the other hand i'm i i have a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a ninety Honda and uh i'm kind of on the other end of the spectrum i have let's see i have uh twelve thousand miles on a little over a two year old car
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you don't have any problems with it
 	
 	
 		so yeah and it's a it's a absolutely flawless car it uh and it's the smoothest car i've ever ridden i uh
 		ah  what's that
 	
 	
 		is it an Accord
 		it's an Accord
 	
 	
 		Accord yes and uh so the the things that personally if i ever if i had to buy another car uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		huh i'd be  the the new American cars uh their ads intrigue me
 		because they think they can catch up uh with uh the Japanese but as far as
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i think one of the things that they are going to have to impress me with is is again this uh
 		the thing that impresses you about yours and that's uh frequency of repair and and absolute reliability
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		because the worst thing that can happen to a person is i think is uh to have to go in and get it fixed you know it's it's
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah because it just breaks it more
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah  there's a a that that was i i noticed that uh uh with one of my other cars uh
 		if if there's this kind of uh natural curve of decay you know decay curve uh half the time when you take it in it's farther down the and you get it back it's farther down the curve than when you took it in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because those guys are they're being paid for uh you know last time i had my car repaired uh even even this car i took it in they said sixty dollars an hour and
 	
 	
 		wow that's as much as i make programming
 	
 	
 		and
 		well i said sixty dollars an hour
 	
 	
 		i mean and i don't even get the sixty i only make i only get the thirty so
 	
 	
 		they charged me a hundred and thirty dollars labor but they clocked my car out at an hour after they clocked it in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so they they charged me for two and a half you know basically two and a half hours uh labor an hour later and i asked them about that and they said that's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh that's flat rate sir you know that they look it up in the book and if it takes an hour to do something why and they can get it done in thirty minutes why they charge you an hour
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so anyway those that uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		in other words there's no there's no benefit for going to a skilled mechanic
 	
 	
 		yeah so uh anyway what i'm looking for is is reliability because i wanna keep it away from the from the uh the repair people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the other thing i'm i guess i'd be looking for is uh
 		um
 		you know mileage counts with me even though i even though i don't drive that much i i like mileage
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah somebody told me uh once the a casual conversation that this guy ran a a towing service
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		and uh i was telling him about you know i was thinking about buying a car and he said you know i he said he he knew it would sound biased but he said that about uh
 		i don't know four out of five cars that he tows are Japanese cars and he said he just he didn't why you know he'd been in the he'd been in the business for awhile and he wasn't sure maybe it was because people who bought those cars
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know would would rather have it towed than try some other thing you know like you know having somebody drag it home with a chain
