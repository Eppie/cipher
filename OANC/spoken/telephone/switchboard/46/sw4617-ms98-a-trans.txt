 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i say the uh
 		probably the best thing to do is is
 		tie them with a rope and throw them in the water if they sink  they're innocent right
 	
 	
 		i see
 		uh
 		a good a good southern solution
 	
 	
 		yeah uh so uh
 		how do you how do you feel that's that's of course being facetious but
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh you have to say that um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know the the things they asked to talk about were whether the uh
 		whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing and seems to me that that's i think that's the way it's done now uh at least
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my understanding of the law which isn't very good uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it seems to me that the judge does it and i i think that's probably all right in that they
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know maybe know what the
 		the norm is for a particular thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i guess also what the system will absorb
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they're probably more tuned in to that possibly though on um
 		capital cases like maybe the death penalty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole
 		i mean he could have like a personal prejudice you know judges are people
 		like everybody else even though they're they're supposed to be impartial but
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		maybe uh
 	
 	
 		and i think that may i that may be an exception as well because i think that doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than than the judge
 	
 	
 		i i think that's i think that's the way it is uh whether they they decide whether or not they uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		accused or whatever would get the uh get the death penalty
 		do they have a death penalty in California
 	
 	
 		yes in fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there's a big uproar going on right now uh the uh Governor you know has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was someone who had uh killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		yeah i something like that i've got no problem with them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		i guess the way i think about it is
 		not it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge it's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people  put it to sleep you know just get it out you know it's not able to fit in you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		something inexpensive
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah exactly
 		um
 		i guess
 		kind of the way i think about it also is they just
 		if somebody gets the death penalty they're they're judged guilty they got the death penalty
 		they should have one year and one appeal cover all their bases with one appeal and if not
 		you know don't don't let them sit up there on death row for you know  fifteen years
 	
 	
 		yeah i think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and you'd hate to be one of those
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a
 		yeah oh i'm i'm sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the other thing they asked about was whether uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again i think is the way it is now that all that all verdicts well maybe not i don't know at least in capital cases i'd think they'd have to be unanimous
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i i believe it is in capital i think in like uh lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		however many is on sitting on a jury
 		i i believe that's the way it is but i'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases
 		um
 	
 	
 		yeah the paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial and that there's one juror that is is uh different than the other eleven
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh they've only deliberated four hours or something and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		judge told them they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm telling you
 		go one way or the other that that's probably an expensive trial
 	
 	
 		yeah six months so far they said so
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah probably
 		yeah i'm i'm sure there's a number it's probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day you know
 		worth of all the
 		food for all
 	
 	
 		maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah that's that's been so long i've practically practically forgot who Noriega was you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that has been going on
 		my uh cousin is a FBI agent down in Miami
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah so she  follows that stuff pretty closely
 		but uh  yeah she's not involved in that that case
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 		well have you ever served on a jury
 	
 	
 		she doesn't
 		no i haven't i never have my wife has but i i haven't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i got called but i uh never uh got selected for a jury i sat for twelve ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process and they had
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		some guy that was uh defending himself
 	
 	
 		oh
