 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i think Don that maybe immigration is more of an issue in my part of the country than it is in yours do you suppose that's true
 	
 	
 		well you're probably right up here in Rochester we uh
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		we don't have uh much controversy about immigration you know being on the Canadian border there's not a whole lot of people  you know dying to come across and live here
 	
 	
 		yeah maybe uh they have a problem
 	
 	
 		sometimes i think they ought to
 	
 	
 		yeah well of course we're quite a ways from the Mexican border here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh oh you hear on the news and whatnot of uh
 		some of the sad things associated with immigration like uh loading up a truck full of immigrants and it runs out of gas or something and they sit out in the bake in the sun because they're locked in the back of it and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		so there are a lot of tragedies i think associated with immigration
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's uh
 		i think it's a real shame but on the other hand you know it kind of
 		even with all the tragedies if you step back and look at it the fact that people want to come here must be that there's something better here than or at least they think there's something better here than there is uh wherever they're from
 	
 	
 		yeah oh absolutely absolutely i i mean that the what i see is Mexico of course rather South American countries
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh unfortunately i think that that the immigrants tend to really stretch the social services that can be provided to the folks uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true but i think that's probably always been true throughout uh history of the United States uh i think anytime you have uh
 		you know immigrants coming in who perhaps you know don't have the ability to communicate with a
 		large percentage of the population that's already here i think they're bound to to push the social services a little bit do you think it's worse today than it was maybe fifty years ago
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah i think maybe it is i and i think that's not necessarily the fault of immigration but just the way the world is going to you know what in a hand basket anyway  i think that there's so many other problems especially in the cities
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh crime for example and
 		i
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know i think it's all tied up together i know that the immigrant immigrant of course now Dallas has a lot of uh
 	
 	
 		yeah you're probably right
 	
 	
 		Asian immigrants in fact a large community of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh they have their special problems uh
 		oh for example crime i mentioned crime against immigrants is is a severe problem because the people that came from the southeast Asian countries don't want to call the police
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they they have fear of the police and whatnot
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		it's really interesting to me because as as you as as you pointed out at the beginning here in Rochester uh
 		now we don't have it immigration problem we don't even have a lot of immigration but on the other hand you know it's we do have uh a large influx of uh people from say Jamaica
 		or other parts of the Caribbean that that's really you know and Puerto Rico we have a a large population from there people who have come over you know maybe in the last you know ten or twenty years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		have moved here now why somebody from Jamaica want to would want to move to cold Rochester  i'm a little uh i'm a little hard pressed  to understand but they do it so so you know i don't blame them to each their own
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but you know if you look at at a place like Rochester now now we have a large
 		population of like second and third generation Americans
 		of people who came you know whose parents or grandparents came to uh the United States you know people from Italy uh people from Poland people from the Ukraine um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and i always you know i always wonder whether you know was the situation any different
 		back then i mean how did the people who had been in the United States for for a while feel about this large amount of immigration
 		uh it's fairly well known that at one of the major companies in Rochester who i won't say their name but i'm sure you've heard of them uh back in the thirties didn't want to hire the Italian immigrants
 		because it it was it was a discriminatory practice
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you know it just makes me wonder you know and you know i look at what what made this country great and a lot of cases it was the immigrants who came over and worked and i and sometimes i wonder you know whether you know just how different is the situation today
 	
 	
 		oh i think i think they want to work i think they're often under educated
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think that's why maybe one reason why they have so much difficult in their own countries
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i
 		i have trouble with
