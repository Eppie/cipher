 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		why don't you go ahead and start
 	
 	
 		okay well i think the court systems could stand some improvement uh
 		trial by jury is good but a lot of time it
 		in in a lot of cases
 		uh is circumstantial evidence that that convicts a person which i don't think is all the time good because
 		sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent
 		i mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have a eyewitness
 		and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me i don't know
 	
 	
 		so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit or not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
 	
 	
 		i think so
 	
 	
 		you know i  i attended a trial in uh
 		in Germany when i was a student and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's the sort of system they have the trials are held by a panel of
 		three uh three or four judges who are well they're like lawyers i guess they're experts in the law and uh there  there really isn't a jury and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh they do the questioning also the judges do the questioning and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they uh
 		it's i think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they uh
 		uh the judge is also sort of a jury
 		uh but i'm not sure i like that i think i prefer the jury system myself
 	
 	
 		you think you prefer the jury you think your chances are better
 	
 	
 		uh well actually i think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or
 		a jury  what i what i worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual that's where you really need a jury of peers
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		because uh anytime the the government um
 		is the government against the individual you need some kind yeah they need the protection of ordinary citizens i think that's really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system system change is uh
 		um there ought to be uh um well
 		i guess i don't think that uh um
 		juries need to decide sentencing all the time i think maybe the a judge is a better judge of that or um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well sometimes sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair
 		i mean even if well the jury i guess they do decide that but but i'm like you in a case like that most time its
 		i don't know maybe i'm too too uh uh
 		conservative when it come to that the the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent that's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but people who don't who don't have day in and day out life long experience with
 		what prison's really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see i think that
 		is maybe uh a little bit naive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in Texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's kind of a
 		um hanging jury atmosphere  but in a lot of places i think people bend over the other way but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i guess
 		i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it some cases some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i kind of like that system yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's not a bad system
 		but i i do think it need to be shaken up a little bit but the thing is too maybe they need more of uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know more of a expert types
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know Joe Blow or whoever
 		and a good citizen or whoever and and call them in
 	
 	
 		right
 		and lawyers blow sand in their eyes
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		i would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
 	
 	
 		right right exactly
 	
 	
 		insurance cases and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where
 		and um there'd be more honest settlements instead of this um
 		uh tugging of people's heart strings and um making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		putting putting on a act or whatever
 	
 	
 		or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering
 	
 	
 		um-hum  exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		so
 		in i think in in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but in civil trials
 		i'd like
