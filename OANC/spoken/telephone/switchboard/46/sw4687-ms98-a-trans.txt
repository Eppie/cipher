 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well uh my opinion on taxation well could being in New York state
 		where taxes are high and services are low
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i guess i'd have to say i don't think we're getting our money's worth as far as uh the tax system is concerned i think a lot of it is going to waste
 		on uh services services that aren't necessary and uh out-of-date ideas that just don't make sense anymore in these times
 	
 	
 		yeah i i have to agree i'm uh right now i'm in Atlanta in Atlanta but i grew up and am from uh Utica New York
 		so uh i understand and i agree with the uh New York situation situation
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah it's as a matter of fact they recently in our county here our state sales tax has been seven percent
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		pretty much forever well they've just decided now when our county where i am is looking at upping the tax rate to eight percent to try and close a deficit uh that they've found in the county budget here and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know between the increases in the sales tax and of course we have the high state tax
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		now we have to look into the possibility of you know it if it isn't from the Bush administration with user fees it's more direct taxation
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know what the taxes are like down in Georgia
 	
 	
 		well  it's um it's kind of tough to tell i haven't really got no good feel for it yet the um i've been down here for only like six months
 		so it um they're not i don't think they're quite as bad as they are in New York state i guess is my opinion right now um there is like there are there's a tax on food here which is you know a little bit different because they don't have that up there
 		and and other than that right now they're starting to realize that their taxes are low
 		but they also realize that they still have to make sure their roads are paved and so on so they're starting to talk about um raising like instead of registering or uh getting your license which costs five dollars now they decide to well maybe we should charge forty dollars for it
 	
 	
 		well they just did that up here too it Mario Mario raised it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		up here um considerably and you know we've had our road road road taxes and gas tax the gas tax was such a Utica boondoggle being from Utica you probably
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um remember when they put that into effect and how that was going to save our roads  and what it did is it all went to New York City to  refurbish that subway disaster
 	
 	
 		yeah that would
 		right
 		of course
 		of course
 		no that seems like we're in from New York state i guess you're you're pretty much your main concern is yes you sit there and to allow um you know taxes like crazy and all you do is see all the money go in a big funnel towards New York City
 	
 	
 		well yeah it's you you know roads this year have been especially bad they um here in Rochester they've now because to save tax money and that they have turned off the expressway lights at night
 	
 	
 		oh yeah um-hum yeah they've been talking about doing that here too but they haven't they've almost been able to push it through but people started complaining and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they just shoved it through here and you know to hell with people and uh put it into effect and then suddenly of course you know ever since every day in the newspaper here it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		people complaining you know well it was only saving two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year it's just we're paying good tax money for this and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they turned it off yet they're still giving money to all these bizarre things in New York City the roads aren't any better here
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh even the town here where i am in um the taxes have increased again i mean they just can't push property taxes any higher that's why they're looking at this sales tax business now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's down here they're um that i'm amazed at the one cheap thing down here is gas i'm not sure what the price is up there but that down here it's only like eighty nine cents per per gallon
 	
 	
 		oh that's not moving you know that Mario up here is we're i just filled up tonight it was a dollar it's a dollar fifteen nine a gallon
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i was home over at Christmas break and it was i saw the gas prices and it was like boy what a switch
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you know we also have a somewhat of a monopoly here of the gas suppliers you know anywhere else in the state it's uh probably a nickel less but they say it's going to increase around the summer time to a dollar twenty five up here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh sure yeah
 	
 	
 		which is insane
 	
 	
 		yep
 		well as soon as they get near Memorial Day people start traveling and everyone knows it so we've got to raise the gas prices
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		oh well it's it's it's interesting topic coming two days from tax day
 	
 	
 		yes i know i and i just i actually had filed earlier and i got my refund tonight actually small but small but uh i got it back anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah we're
 		
 
 		we're just sitting down tonight to get ours filled out we're going to do it we're going to do it and we're going to get we were doing software to do it and then you know put off put it off put it off
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 		yep
 	
 	
 		now tonight
 		being two days left
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's
 		pretty pretty frustrating when you see the whole situation it doesn't seem as though
 	
 	
 		okay
