 
     		
 	
 		okay i'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as a has been so
 	
 	
 		oh so
 		well it let's put it this way we've got the New England Patriots up here so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah right well
 	
 	
 		they've had some serious problems in the past couple years
 	
 	
 		really why
 	
 	
 		yeah um well uh partly due to ownership you know uh Victor Kiam owned the uh the Patriots uh for a period of a number of years and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he always had this uh this wonderful quality of quality being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something
 		and uh they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth and it recently was sold to uh some other people
 		so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and uh keep uh the Patriots in the New England arear anyways
 	
 	
 		yeah well it'll be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		i've been to a couple of i've been to a few games before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now you you're you're from Texas so you've got two football teams down there
 	
 	
 		right
 		well it depends on where you're from in Texas i live right by Dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned that's how it's is it's divided yeah it really is so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i see there's that type of segregation huh wow
 	
 	
 		we've got our Cowboys here and and uh i don't think anybody roots differently
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you
 	
 	
 		but i have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno and he is for the L the uh Raiders LA Raiders so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do you follow professional sports at all
 	
 	
 		well i just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well  but i've been trying more this year i think i know a little more than i used to i never knew very much at all so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm trying
 	
 	
 		well it's it's a good past time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know particularly football
 		they say uh it football attracts more men because of the you know you the you see the the physical aggression on the field and supposedly psychologists say that uh
 		that um men take out their frustrations by watching football and you know they get together with a bunch of guys and they um
 		uh and they have a good time and everything and that's suppose to be some of the uh male bonding and the and the uh the male instincts i guess or something about uh
 	
 	
 		so i shouldn't even try to do it huh
 	
 	
 		well no it's a it's good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest i think that uh i personally like hockey better because it has contact it's a contact sport it has the speed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey not everybody can play hockey
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we and that's we're a big hockey area up here hotbed up here in New England as well as you know in in the Minnesota area but
 	
 	
 		really
 		i don't even think we have that in Texas but we might do we
 	
 	
 		what hockey
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean no  you probably know i don't know nobody talks about it so i don't think we do
 	
 	
 		no there's no hockey there's no
 		there's no professional hockey teams in in in in Texas it just it's
 	
 	
 		no uh-huh and we have a soccer team that comes and goes we don't even have that very much so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now like they have this World Football League
 	
 	

 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you see we have the NFL that that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and LA Raiders and those teams  there are those teams that play in professional the National Football League
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh now they have what's called the World Football League and they have all these teams from there's a team in London and there's a team  there's a there's a uh teams in other European teams and there's teams in the United States
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and and and they're playing now during the summer months and it's really  you know overkill
 		you know there's only so much football you can watch
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah well i like to do i don't like to watch i don't like to watch anything
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good
 	
 	
 		so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a TV and watch all this stuff i think it's an excuse to do nothing and i i can see what you're saying about the male bonding and the guys get together and that's kind of cool that's fun you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it can get really overdone
 	
 	
 		now have you ever been to a professional football game
 	
 	
 		yeah i have yeah yeah i have
 	
 	
 		have you
 		did you do the whole big the the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole
 	
 	
 		uh  no actually no um
 	
 	
 		well see now see now that's what you got to do see now we talked our wives
 	
 	
 		i've done that for college football yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you the same well the same thing we we talked our wives there's about six or eight guys that we used to go out for these games and uh we talked our wives into going with with us one time and they had a real good time and it was basically for the social atmosphere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right and that's the thing yeah
 	
 	
 		you go you know three or four hours before the game you go set up we set a table up we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but but that whole it it's not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself but it's the whole atmosphere of playing uh of going to a game
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it that you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with a with a a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know you you miss that and and any professional sport i think you miss that
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah that's right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the atmosphere of being there you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well in high school i went to every football game and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i twirled you know and i you know i didn't i still don't know that much about football obviously but i still had a good time you know i
 	
 	
 		yep
 		well football
