 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		did women uh have the more variety in this area right
 	
 	
 		oh i suppose i uh substitute teach in our public schools
 		and what i find out nowadays is people are wearing jeans and and very casual things Polo shirts uh i'm of the opinion that i'm not one of the kids and i want them to know that
 		so i'll dress a little more formally i mean not a business suit but you know a nice skirt and blouse or
 	
 	
 		are you saying that the children that the students uh teachers are wearing jeans
 	
 	
 		well i i should clarify i work in the i'm an artist and i work in the art department so perhaps they are a little more Bohemian
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but  yes yes teachers are wearing jeans and they're wearing sneakers and kind of upsets me because uh it seems that they're getting treated as if they're sloppy
 		and i i like the kids
 	
 	
 		treated as if they're sloppy or treated as if they're uh peers
 	
 	
 		as if if if the whole situation is too casual
 		i don't get think they get the same respect as if they distance themselves in their behavior from the kids and i think the way they dress says a lot about their attitude
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think they're too casual with the kids and the kids kids curse in front of them and
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and and take too many liberties and i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh you know as much as i'm there to be their uh to be there for them but i'm not their friend i'm there to teach them something and it's it's business and it's serious and
 	
 	
 		right of course motivation is everything and i suppose you're striving for intimacy on a intellectual level
 		it's really hard to figure out how you're going to do that but of course we're trying to talk about dress and not teaching
 	
 	
 		well i i think i'm talking about dressing how it conveys a uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a sense of um casual behavior and you know and and where it goes from there it's just a tangent of the same subject
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i am in a much more conventional position i work as a uh white collar worker uh i'm a senior
 		principal scientist at SRI International uh work with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		what is is uh your particular field
 	
 	
 		speech technology
 		teaching computers teaching computers how to understand the speech
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh so you must be very interested in uh Texas Instruments
 		but anyway get off the subject
 	
 	
 		in Texas Instruments oh yeah i actually used i used to be chief speech scientist at Texas Instruments
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		so i i guess you're in a business suit all the time
 	
 	
 		no actually i try to stay behind the scenes which means i wear slacks and uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		my own personal style and it's  it's variable and there there are a lot of people that'll wear jeans but i say probably most people uh wear dresses or slacks and um
 		wear the men wear uh um
 		probably most of them wear long sleeve shirts without ties uh it's interesting it's sort of silly and ironic not ironic but it's silly in in a sense that
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		on visitor days which is are quite frequently people  quite frequently dress up and they wear ties and coats
 		and uh on non visitor days people dress down and they wear just slacks and dress shirts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  it it well i guess it's silly in that the point is to be there and do quality work and not wonder about what you're wearing too much
 	
 	
 		right and and it it's uh it's not one of my dressing is not one of my main obsessions or preoccupations
 	
 	
 		what uh no i can see how you'd say that i'm not heavily into uh what's in this year or what's out this year i usually i have a certain amount of money that i spend on clothing and i buy things that will last year after year and um
 	
 	
 		well i i buy a new shirt once a year whether i need it or not
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 		so i guess you've got a collection don't you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i don't pay much attention to it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i don't know um
 	
 	
 		now this this question did it relate to work or did it relate to to uh whatever
 	
 	
 		i think it was just um clothing and how you feel about it and do you change your wardrobe from season to season
 		um i guess the warmer it gets the less clothing i wear but i don't know that i i change my sense of color or style to
 		to match a season but i do know people who have told me that the different carpets come out and different colors come out because uh the seasons change your mood and and your ideas of color and fashion change with uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh you know with your mood and i guess it's all kinds of poetic uh
 	
 	
 		i guess i'm a typical oblivious male in that respect
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i've met males that aren't terribly oblivious to clothing it's uh
 	
 	
 		i said typical
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		well some guys seem to think it's a shortcoming being too involved in their clothing like they have deeper more meaningful things
