 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay let's see do you live uh do you live in a neighborhood that uh
 		has been affected recently by any uh crimes
 	
 	
 		uh let me see not recently i we're Framingham is uh midway between Boston and Worcester and it's mostly mostly in Boston that we're finding a lot of problems
 		um basically it's lined up blacks versus whites and there've been a lot of murders and mostly boyfriend girlfriend type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah we uh in
 		Portland is is
 		pretty uh how shall i say it
 		they have a lot of problems but the problems are confined confined to low income neighborhoods well i shouldn't say low income neighborhoods uh
 		neighborhoods where a lot of low income families live and and uh where there's lot a lot of drug and uh broken families and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh that doesn't
 		i i
 		try to uh in my thinking
 		to keep from blaming it on the on the nationality of people and more blame it on the culture of the uh you know broken families and and uh drugs and things like that
 	
 	
 		right i think drugs plays a really big part a lot of times it doesn't come out in the paper or on the news
 		um you know they're more into as far as the news reporters into oh you know two black guys killed each other or they knifed each other other to death and we have a lot with uh gang problems
 	
 	
 		yes the gang problems
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 	
 	
 		the the problem
 	
 	
 		that seems to be the major thing and we just recently with all the problems that there are in Boston we did have i was thinking we did have one crime in Framingham where a girl picked up a guy at a bar
 		and uh her kids woke up she brought him home and her kids woke up and she was dead she had been knifed to death
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and he was a homeless person but why anybody would want to bring somebody like that home you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		too many hormones huh
 	
 	
 		really  i think that was the the major part of it too much alcohol and she just invited him in and he waited until she was sleeping and then let her have it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		too much alcohol
 		
 
 		yeah just kind of a psychopath
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the the crime problem is uh
 		i don't know if if you're
 		this is uh about a four hour topic but a five minute uh window here so the for me i
 		feel very bad about uh
 		the people that are affected uh the people in the crime ridden areas are
 		more innocent in some cases uh
 		than the than the press finds well what i'm really trying to say is they are working class people who work very hard and are seriously affected by that and uh so even though i see
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh how shall i say it uh the problems of crime affect the black working class and uh minority working people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		much worse than they affect me uh so the the crime problem has to be solved one of the problems that i see is that
 		and they always compare  uh America they say well in America we have uh you know a gun problem and uh uh that
 		i i read a discussion once of of uh the reason why England for instance uh has their gun problems and other problems are so low and it basically boils down to they don't have
 		the Bill of Rights doesn't exit for those guys if you are standing at a corner and somebody and the Bobby walks up to you and he says you've been standing here four buses have gone by uh you're a pickpocket empty your pockets
 		if he finds some things in in there then they will proceed to your house perhaps and uh say open your door up and go in and search your house and after that they can enter at any time
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		now that has the advantage of uh weeding out how shall i say it of getting rid of the dandelions before they've before they uh populate your lawn
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but  it it just doesn't function in our court system over here we we won't allow you to be uh frisked by a cop uh without good reason
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's wrong i think that's where the law has got to change because they've found uh how many people have we read about or heard about in the national news that have been picked up and because of a technicality they're left let off
 	
 	
 		yeah an actually
 	
 	
 		you know and that's really not right and then they go out and do it again you know
 	
 	
 		that's right and and like i my earlier example uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i could spend
 		every day all day just picking the heads off of dandelions uh once i let my lawn get infested
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh
