 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all righty
 	
 	
 		okay do you have a budget that you go on
 	
 	
 		yeah i sure do um i have it's pretty much a ledger sheet and i just write down
 		all my bills how much i'm going to have to pay and i do it per paycheck for me which is every other week uh i mean i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it tends to work out pretty well that way i can anticipate you know a little better i usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually comes in i go ahead and fill in the actual amount
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		that way i know how much pocket change i'm going to have left at the end of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that works okay for me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well my bills i usually know approximately how much they're going to be each month they  are more or less just about the same you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh same here
 	
 	
 		uh very seldom are they any different and then uh like for groceries and everything we try to put like
 		two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and then we put our receipts in there you know and usually that's enough
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um but i don't have any you know small children to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the doctor or something like that with them
 	
 	
 		right luckily i don't either i mean you know maybe my cat would get sick but i mean usually that's not so much that it would throw me off
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah right in fact i did have to take my dog to the vet the other day
 	
 	
 		but you so you know what i'm saying yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that it's it's worse than having a kid huh
 	
 	
 		i sometimes it can be sometimes it can be i guess the worst thing i've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i do try to build in a little extra money each month to to be able to do that type of thing so
 	
 	
 		yeah um i'm not working right now i worked for P I E and then uh
 		they went bankrupt so i just went ahead and took my early pension
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i only get that once a month
 	
 	
 		ooh that's tough
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my roommate only gets paid once a month
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking so
 	
 	
 		yeah so you know i really have to try to budget that i don't go over that amount you know each month
 	
 	
 		right i for for years got paid once a month and and in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there's always one or two stragglers that usually they were for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i would pay all of them at one sitting and i would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		and and that worked okay for me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know right now i i'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt i think as everybody is and so
 	
 	
 		and
 		oh yeah right now it's terrible isn't it
 	
 	
 		it's yeah it's really bad but um it's going pretty well and i've got a real good plan mapped out here so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh i also like belong to a Christmas club because you know i used to belong to a Christmas club last year i didn't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then so then naturally Christmas comes along and that's puts you behind too you know so this year now i have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my checking account for my Christmas club
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i figure you know that's gonna help some
 	
 	
 		that'll cover your gifts come Christmas time that'll yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah right you know
 	
 	
 		that'd be good because yeah most people are spending three or four months digging you know at least digging out after Christmas so
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 		and i'm taking
 	
 	
 		yeah i i was pretty fortunate this Christmas i didn't get in debt so
 	
 	
 		oh that's good i'm taking like um sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what i can
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i won't have to go out and buy the readymade clothes anymore
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh it's so rare you hear anybody doing that any longer
 	
 	
 		i know i even bought myself a Surger you know and i just love it i haven't learned everything to do on it yet but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i figure that will help me save
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		my um roommate does sew some and and um
 		i she hasn't sewed anything in a long time but i i'm sure that she could pick it up again my mother always sewed she tried to teach me when i was young but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		not interested
 	
 	
 		yeah well see some people are and some people aren't because i have some sisters i have three sisters and none of those are really interested in sewing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but that's a real good way to save money though by doing that
 	
 	
 		yeah and then i can also you know do some crafts and sell those at garage sales
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so which i've been doing
 	
 	
 		well that's a good way to to make a little extra money
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well this is another way that i'm making a little extra money so that was you know nice that i tripped over this opportunity and you're actually my first call
 	
 	
 		oh really oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i had not um
 		done
 	
 	
 		well have you called
 	
 	
 		i i guess today's today's my first day that i could even do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh it is
 	
 	
 		yeah you beat me to the punch here
 	
 	
 		oh well that's nice that's nice you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i was i was about to call to get to see if i could get on with somebody so so that was great
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well i guess that's about all i can talk to about budgets when i was working i uh bought a bond a month out of my you know they automatically took it out of my out of my uh payroll
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah i take have some money taken out  and put in a 401K
