 
     		
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've had
 		uh three boys through
 		i guess uh some child care each one of them and now they're in school so it's all over but uh
 		i guess i would say it's not easy to find what what most parents would want
 	
 	
 		well i can profit by this because i'm due with my first in about three months
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess uh
 		the um the only rule i can think of is that uh
 		i like to find look for places with uh
 		good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that if they're associated with a college or a university they're usually pretty good bet
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		um
 		i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy car or refrigerator something you'd like to get it from some
 		good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care
 	
 	
 		i guess not usually i suppose you're absolutely right there um-hum
 	
 	
 		i
 		yeah for profit places i would really look at them awfully carefully but uh
 		when i was
 		when my kids were young i was teaching at a university and uh the child care center associated with our university was quite good so i felt confident that they would do the right thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum of aren't don't they kind of use them for everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs for their personal for their pet theories or some such thing
 	
 	
 		oh you mean uh learning type uh  yeah i mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission but yeah i suppose um
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		if you're if there's a psychology department or an education department around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another i guess that's true but uh
 		i never had a bad experience in that respect  of course you
 		also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents and they're you know pretty good people
 	
 	
 		um well the thing i really worry about is um the sexual abuse cases you read about
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i mean you just feel awful if something like that happened
 	
 	
 		i
 		yeah i never really worry very much about it i tend to think those are
 		very rare but quickly exploited and made public so i never really worried too much about that being uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the case with my boys
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um
 		i you know i think those things get
 		into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them but i don't think it's as common as uh the newspapers would make you believe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum and another thing is cost
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i mean i know so many of my friends i went to school with who are having babies right now and they finding some cases they're finding that it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in day care
 	
 	
 		that
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		well in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were um in school and i'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult and i think it was the right thing to do when we were um
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		we
 		just decided that we would do it and we went ahead  but um not everybody can make that choice and even even though my wife wasn't working we did have
 		um one or another of the boys in uh child care for part time just for part of the day
 		um or a couple of days a week just so that uh other things could get done around the house and so on so
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so we did look around i think my wife
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is much better than i am at just walking into a place and getting a feeling for  whether it's a loving and caring place or not and uh so i would always trust her judgment on that
 	
 	
 		hm
 		hm well i'm just thanking heaven my husband just got a new job his last company he was only working four days a week so it's and he just got a new job he's getting lots of overtime he got a pay raise
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not
 	
 	
 		there's absolutely no question that you're gonna be the best  child care provider for that kid so  yeah do it as long as you can
 	
 	
 		i suppose
 	
 	
 		but i think you know you you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for um
 		how they treat the kids and uh uh what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you uh commit your child to them and i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you have the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open that you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth and if they're at all queasy about that then
 	
 	
 		you have to start wondering if they don't want yes
 	
 	
 		i'd look elsewhere yeah right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you have other friends that have kids uh being taken care of in uh child care
 	
 	
 		um i have one but i haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so but i really think the news reports are uh tend to sensationalize the problems i think the problems are more ones of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		cost and resources and um pay and exhaustion and  human things like that rather than these um uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		really wild wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
 	
 	
 		this is true
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Current Affair can get  several shows with those cases
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		well
