 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		actually i'm in like i said i'm in Minneapolis and the big thing up here of course is the Twins um
 	
 	
 		i imagine you can't escape it
 	
 	
 		no it's it's pretty pervasive it kind of goes into about all aspects of society i think up here
 		but um actually i don't know how much of the World Series you caught last year but that was a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		well of course it was fun for you
 	
 	
 		well to be honest with you i'm not from Minneapolis in fact i've only been up here a few months and i'm going back at the end of next month
 	
 	
 		to
 	
 	
 		uh Orlando Florida
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so i'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything but
 	
 	
 		i was born and raised in uh near Miami and uh spent the last twenty years in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh where the Rangers played
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh for the last uh what year  roughly year i've been in San Francisco where there're two teams the Oakland A's and the San Francisco Giants
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but honestly you know i uh i do my duty and watch the sports on uh the newscast
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but that's about all the exposure i have to sports
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i haven't followed it real closely at all um except like i said last year when the World Series rolled around i did
 		i did follow that pretty religiously went out to the bars you know drank a beer watched the game sat a girl a good time that way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well yeah sure well i guess the uh San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A's were like the leading teams a couple years ago
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		well i think i don't know well that's sort of what i gather
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		and uh i don't know what is the prognosis for uh this year
 	
 	
 		uh real good as far as i can tell people are pretty excited about
 	
 	
 		oh good i i assume that means good for the Minnesota
 	
 	
 		well yeah  sorry about that yeah uh as far as the Twins are concerned it seems to be real good
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um my roommate went and saw them play um their season opener uh a couple of nights ago and they they won that one seven to one
 		so um
 		that's pretty good i guess it looks like they'll be doing pretty well
 		are you still there
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		okay i heard some noise on the line didn't know what happened
 	
 	
 		i think a train went by
 	
 	
 		oh okay all right
 	
 	
 		but i know a train went by i don't know what the noise was but i think it probably was the the train
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i don't know i i i don't even know uh who who has been winning in uh as far as the uh San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A's but i think they both won their opener i sort of gathered that
 		in my uh subliminal memory
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  well maybe that has has good tidings for their uh for their season coming up i've actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco right now
 		uh he's doing the same thing i'm doing which is basically uh an internship we were both doctoral students
 		and he's doing his with IBM and i'm doing mine with Honeywell but um i i think he kind of follows the sports and i think he's mentioned um the Oakland A's a couple times
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good
 	
 	
 		i guess they're in different leagues is that right the A's
 	
 	
 		as far as i know yeah and in the major leagues i guess there's a couple of different divisions and then of course there's the minors um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i guess i'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um but i was talking to my roommate a couple nights ago right after that game
 		and he offered you know to take me to one of the games because apparently he'd bought uh he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat or a row of seats actually
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		for the home games but the the thing is there's like eighty six home games per year
 		so there's no no way you can ever use them all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		eighty six
 	
 	
 		eighty six i was amazed to hear that you know that's just the home games and i i thought it was a mistake but he goes no see eight
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they must play every day then
 	
 	
 		yeah well just just about yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean eighty six times two
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is a hundred and sixty
 	
 	
 		and that's you know yeah that's almost
 	
 	
 		and that's
 		Lord that's uh over five months worth
 	
 	
 		that's a lot of baseball
 	
 	
 		even if they play every day that's over five months worth
 	
 	
 		well you you if you if you consider it the season starts well it's the season started about a week and a half ago
 		and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place i believe in December or January
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so it did last week year didn't it or was it November
 	
 	
 		that was the Super Bowl
 	
 	
 		maybe it was November i'm thinking about i know it was doggone cold up here um
 	
 	
 		i don't feel so bad i think you you don't know all that much more than i do about baseball
 	
 	
 		well i know for sure it was i know it was after September
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because that's when i got up here
 	
 	
 		i see okay
 	
 	
 		and it and it was at least two months after i got up here
 	
 	
 		oh really okay well
 	
 	
 		yeah so it had to be November anyway
 	
 	
 		well i i i know uh the Super Bowl
