 		well let's see it turns out that uh Tektronix i work at Tektronix and it's a very
 		uh low key place as far as dress goes  you just wear uh let's see
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when i first came here i wore suits but after a while i got uh  found out that that wasn't all that important i'm an engineer
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and uh so i get to wear  just uh
 		how shall i say it uh walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well walking how shall i say it kind of
 		like Avia uh
 		walking shoes uh
 	
 	
 		well that's nice comfortable stuff
 	
 	
 		yes open shirt open at the neck you know no tie and uh
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		just uh reasonable looking
 		how shall i say it uh
 		sports clothes or well some guys wear some people even wear Levis
 	
 	
 		wow that's nice
 	
 	
 		now being from Philadelphia i don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed right
 	
 	
 		well  actually right now i'm a full time college student so my dress code is very very expensive yeah i usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime but over the summers i've had a job internships with the newspaper
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's  so generally then i dress
 		you know nicer usually nice summer slacks or more sometimes skirts stuff like that so then it's still
 		you know the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and
 		coming in out of the office but you still have to have a professional
 		image kind of thing to go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that so
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah well i uh
 		i just recently
 		applied for a different job in the company here and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so i
 		decided well i'd wear a suit and it it was very interesting uh like i said most of the people at at this company don't wear suits uh most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual almost the same clothes that that you'd wear to school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		wow that must be nice atmosphere then
 	
 	
 		well it has been although the new president and CEO of the company is
 		from a much more formal eastern uh background
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so the result is that uh so anyway i wore this suit and i went over to uh uh to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it and it and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i was almost converted because uh  the effect of that suit on the way people responded reacted and responded to me as opposed to
 		the uh just to kind of
 		how shall i say it they know you're there but they don't uh you don't there's no notice at all but when i wore a suit that day uh
 		it was obvious that people didn't know
 		whether i was a worker bee or a manager
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so people uh how shall i say it made a
 		made much more effort to notice you acknowledge your presence say hello
 		and uh things like that so
 	
 	
 		that's interesting it's like a mini little study there  that's really interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and so this dress for success thing i think is uh by and large i've i'm kind of uh convinced that uh by that just that one uh
 		uh experience and then having talked to several other people that that uh
 		unless you're in a an environment where they're going to make fun of of of better clothes that better clothes always pay off
 	
 	
 		right
 		hum that's interesting
 	
 	
 		doesn't mean they have to be
 		uh how shall i say it
 		they they don't have to be the the most uh
 		the absolute best
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		a little dressing a little bit above the standard i think would uh
 		pay off so i'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again
 	
 	
 		that's neat that's neat
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i i don't know no
 		i know eastern now the other thing we do here of course is a single not quite a single climate we have uh we do have some snow in the wintertime and it can be
 		quite warm in the summertime not hot like uh i lived in the midwest for a while
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i know that uh you know it can be
 		freezing cold in the wintertime and
 		and hot and uh sticky in the summertime
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we don't have that much it's uh it's a very mild climate
 	
 	
 		oh well that's nice that's good for the clothes budget i would imagine because here
 	
 	
 		yes it it is
 	
 	
 		gosh we had uh
 		the winter hasn't been bad this winter it's it it's only snowed maybe once or twice but it's been cold low twenties let's say and then the summer gets up to eighties nineties so
