 
     		
 	
 		so um how do you feel about the crime in your city is it uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well
 		um
 		Minneapolis isn't too bad um i know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's kind of gone up in scale and  and some other things um i personally had a little experience the other day uh somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but actually you know when you look at at Minneapolis as compared to where i used to live it's really quite a bit better um because i came from Florida
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in Orlando there's
 		crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever
 	
 	
 		oh yeah um San Jose California
 	
 	
 		so what part of California are you from
 		oh really i have a good friend there
 	
 	
 		here you know the real problems are the gangs a lot of gang related a lot of murders um just in general the whole we've only been here a couple of years uh before that we lived in Colorado but in comparison to Colorado it's real noticeable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean you can just feel i mean i can just sense i mean i won't even i won't go to the grocery store at night
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's
 	
 	
 		you know and it it's that kind of thing and uh
 	
 	
 		that's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a neighborhood watch program in the house um the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce um home theft burglary and things of that sort do you have that where you live or
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well um interestingly enough right before i moved up here i'm an intern and then i go back down in May
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um but in Orlando before i moved up we had a real problem with it um we've been broken into in my apartment about four times
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		in like two and a half weeks and one of the things that i i helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because they were just it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work you know and then the houses were left unguarded
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um but yeah i think given that people are pretty conscientious about it that's a good way to to work it with a neighborhood watch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well you know um also i've heard that uh the newest thing is a lot of people are  specializing in robbing people during the time they're home
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		like on the weekends a high percentage of uh free time i think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is uh spent doing yard work
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		outdoors so they wait while you're outsides outdoors they know the house is unlocked and then they just slip in
 	
 	
 		that's amazing
 	
 	
 		slip in slip out you know they know exactly what they're going for so i've heard that's really on the rise as far as um you know a new type of crime
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 		yeah it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter  really you know
 	
 	
 		yeah  unfortunately yes
 	
 	
 		yeah unfortunately it's starting to really you know look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like one of the guys i work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		the the crime level there of course is quite a bit quite a bit uh more pronounced
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		but uh
 		yeah i guess
 	
 	
 		i mean
 	
 	
 		i think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis i'm not real sure uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it helps to know your neighbors you know they give you you're supposed to make lists of um cars like i know a lot of my neighbors right around my development if i see a car that's
 		unfamiliar we we have a list is that what you you did in your program where you have a list of license plates yeah
 	
 	
 		pretty much yeah i was i was basically involved in that in the organization of it and then i left right in the middle of it i'm not sure where we went from there but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		yeah that that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious uh activities like that sure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i mean you you hate to be paranoid but there are really only so many things you can do you can have the house alarm um neighborhood watch program
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know uh as a woman not go out at night um you can do that which is what i choose to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah one of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited even even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's against the law to do a lot of things you know they could basically um when i was getting robbed down in Florida i was really considering electrifying doors um things like that like they did in Miami that time
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's um-hum
 		but it's not um if you kill someone in your home as long as they're in your home it's considered self-defense though
 	
 	
 		that's not always true
 	
 	
 		it isn't
 	
 	
 		no there was a there was a case about two years ago
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where a guy knew he was gonna get robbed
 		and essentially what he had done is set a a electrocution a electrocution trap
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for the burglar in his own home the guy came in while he was home
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned he didn't die but he was severely burned and he took the guy to court and won a settlement
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah so that really that makes you think you know it's like your hands are really very much tied
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i think if if you had handgun a handgun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a handgun it's the middle of the night someone's downstairs
