 		and i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because
 		right now i'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there and uh there's a lot of profit that's coming in but when it comes to uh small corporations they seem to
 		pocket it a little bit quick quickly or whatever or however you wanna say it
 		and uh
 		the benefits aren't as great as when i worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say
 		okay we've got this amount of money let's put into this plan this plan you got Four O One K plans you have uh better vacation plans uh you have just
 		in general maternity leave plans that that kind of thing big corporations are able to do that versus
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		small corporations uh
 		you know they just don't have the money or just uh feel that there isn't a need for it
 		so i've worked for both big and small so i've had a chance to kind of take a look at uh the pros and cons of both
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i've worked for uh well i worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts for awhile and the only they even hate to give out unemployment
 	
 	
 		sure
 		um-hum
 		sure um-hum
 	
 	
 		at the end of tax season because they you know they're fairly even though they're a large scale company they're very the offices individual offices are very small
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sure
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and now i work for the Framingham school teacher uh school system because i'm a teacher and uh we have much better benefits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure
 	
 	
 		you know in the system we have a good pension plan um let me see we have a profit sharing plan to a degree
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's pretty good for you know being a a school district type program
 	
 	
 		right and we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw the all the town employees in together
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		wow
 		that's extremely good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because like like the small corporation that i work for there's no pension plan there's no type of uh savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		there's really i think you're allowed so many times uh i think two or three days a week a year it's not accumulative type of sick leave
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um you know things like that so i've been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that i've worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health
 		health care uh you had your insurance and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a a very small place
 		um they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations
 	
 	
 		right the only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees have run into problem especially the retired ones my father's retired from the town of Framingham
 	
 	
 		and
 		um-hum
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and he said that they haven't gotten a a cost of living raise in over five years
 	
 	
 		no yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired and but i hear that bill is in the Senate right now and it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		hopefully will go through
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but um you know i think the schools are at where the schools isn't just the school system and not just the teachers they took in the whole town plus all you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		is it a union
 	
 	
 		uh we have the teachers union which helps out a lot but the town of Framingham pays the benefits and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		that's all the town workers water and sewer and where it's a very large town it's actually should be a city but they kept it a town
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 	
 	
 		um where it's extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more
 		which was really great because we don't have to pay a mayor
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh yeah yeah i know what you mean and that's true i mean yeah it it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position sure
 	
 	
 		right because most of our you know the town employees as far as uh electoral positions are part time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it works out good because we reap the benefits of it and um
 	
 	
 		sure
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but as far as shopping for a job i'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary
 	
 	
 		well that's it you know and and i've kind of looked around uh at that uh too because uh salary wise i don't think i'm making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps
 		or large i'm talking like huge companies like Three M
 		um i'm Honeywell uh uh Texas Instruments  i know people that are that have vacation times and benefits benefits that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't even dream of in this small corporation you bring it up to the owner and it's like come on you know partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and of course when it's a small corporation it also wants to expand so that money's spent
 		in a
