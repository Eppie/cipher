 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		how many children do you have now
 	
 	
 		well i have five
 	
 	
 		you have five well you do have a hard time finding time then don't you
 	
 	
 		right
 		well five are i mean four of them are grown they're in college or just out of college so i really have just a thirteen year old at home
 	
 	
 		um-hum you sound so young
 	
 	
 		well i work at it  i try to fool everybody  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to have them uh
 		i think you're doing a good job i just have one child
 		and uh i don't think um well there's not much i can do about it my  my wife and i are uh in our forties you know so uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the they're the pivot point of the universe
 	
 	
 		i think you're right because i was an only child too and that's one reason i have so many  because i really i enjoyed the big family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters and so she's sort of like an only child and it's the same type of thing um
 	
 	
 		um-hum i have a younger brother like that i'm in my forties like i say and i have a brother in his twenties and i was i was the youngest
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i understand how that worked and he was treated like he had five fathers or something
 	
 	
 		right that's exactly how it is you know she's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her when things don't go right she just calls one of them you know but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's a little bit difficult though i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home more and
 	
 	
 		did y'all do a lot of organized things like uh Little League uh soccer and
 	
 	
 		we we really did not my next oldest daughter that's in college in California is a world twirling champion she twirls a baton
 		and we did a lot of things together she and i did a lot of things together and flew we've flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that was a lot of fun but that that i guess you could consider that organized i mean there's a competition all the time we were very heavy into that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		other than that they were pretty much and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that
 	
 	
 		you know i think that's probably true the  if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities and if you have a large number of children or then you don't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well you can't afford to
 	
 	
 		no you can't and there's not enough time um like my son is in uh Little League this year he's ten
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they practice three times a week and they have a game and it's just uh if there were more than one child i don't know there there would be no way to do it
 	
 	
 		right that's right
 	
 	
 		you know one parent go in one direction and i'd have to go in the other and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we could only cover two at that
 	
 	
 		yeah well i know i spent hours in the gym everyday with my daughter and my little one also competed because really she had no choice she had to go with me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and and competing and of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was it was making the friends and going all the places and
 		it was a really neat experience but it took our total time i did not work um when i did this now i do work full time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's just my thirteen year old and myself and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other
 	
 	
 		i don't think although  i think a a more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me
 		but i'm not sure i could afford three i most certainly couldn't educate three  i don't know how my my parents did it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean there were five of us i don't recall you know wanting anything in particular uh but i don't know how my father did it he worked at a truck line and
 		he just didn't make that kind of money with five children but we did okay we had a house and a home and but now my wife and i both work and we don't i don't believe we have as much as my parents did
 		and we only have one child
 	
 	
 		really well things cost a lot more i don't know how it is in Georgia and i don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 		Atlanta's horrible yes have we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and and different areas and from talking to them they're shocked
 	
 	
 		is it
 		really
 	
 	
 		what and they you know the housing so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it they sell their house they stash away a good bit of money
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's what i've heard
 	
 	
 		and come down here and i work with a lot of them they they think they they've really done something then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		compared to to where they came from the housing's cheaper but that's about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'm surprised to hear that i've heard very positive things about Atlanta everybody
