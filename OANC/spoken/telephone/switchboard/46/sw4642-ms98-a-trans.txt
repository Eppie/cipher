 
     		
 	
 		i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		repair actually uh that is really a sore spot with me i i think
 		perhaps the automotive industry is improving but uh like ten years ago
 		um the reliability of automobiles at least US automobiles was pretty dismal and
 		not only that but the uh repair capability of
 		uh service departments and dealerships was equally dismal and uh it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i
 	
 	
 		so do you have a car
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		do you have a car
 	
 	
 		well at that time actually i had a Volkswagen Rabbit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 		it was it it was a real lemon
 		uh subsequently i got a uh Buick Century and it wasn't as bad
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh last year i bought a Honda Accord and i take it in once every seventy five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it and it's wonderful and
 	
 	
 		yeah we used to have a Honda Accord and they're good
 		they're really good cars every time i get taken to an auto repair place you know every time i go i get taken bad you know woman goes in and they go all right we got a sucker
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		let's get how see how much money we can get out of her you know that's what happens every time um so
 	
 	
 		hm
 		hm
 		so what do you what do you have
 	
 	
 		i have a Pontiac six thousand
 	
 	
 		all the more reason to uh have a a Honda
 	
 	
 		yep
 		but our Honda just got old and just wore out it was eleven let's see eleven years old
 		and it just
 		just out of it so
 	
 	
 		so so you bought a Pontiac
 	
 	
 		no uh-huh my husband uh um ex-husband's this this just happened couple of weeks ago he's my ex-husband but just a few months ago when he was my husband um his father gave us this car
 		and everything is wrong with it i mean the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks you know
 	
 	
 		now this what how old is the car
 	
 	
 		um eighty seven and he just doesn't take care of things and but i was awarded the car so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic and i can trust him
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so he's trying to get you know things fixed on it but it's just you know leak leak leak everywhere but um
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know i hate to go into a a repair place because they'll tell me something's wrong with it and it's not
 		you know and charge me twice as much the last time i took it into a repair shop the man told me i needed a master cylinder so i said okay
 		and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars and then um about a month later
 		a man was looking at my car and he asked me you know
 		not a man not a repair man but just a friend and i was telling him that i just had a new master cylinder put on and he said looked at and he said that's not a new master cylinder
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and i didn't even know what one was and um he showed it to me and it was old rusty
 		just awful it was no more new than nothing
 	
 	
 		so apparently it was the same one that was on there
 	
 	
 		oh more than likely
 	
 	
 		oh we just uh refilled refilled uh probably filled the the brake fluid up and that was it
 	
 	
 		that was it probably it was very i was so irritated and that's happened to me more than once or twice just just just about every time i've went in somewhere
 	
 	
 		so what's the solution to that i guess find a reputable service
 	
 	
 		and and you just i can't hardly find one you know
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		the guy that's doing most of my my car now um goes to my church and that's the only reason you know i go to him
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i know him and i know he will tell me the truth because he doesn't even charge me for for doing it so he's not gonna you know
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		take me yeah i just pay for the parts and he does it so
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i am so
 	
 	
 		you're lucky
 	
 	
 		i don't know i don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car they're usually the worst one of all
 		we took our Honda to the Honda dealership and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars we you know they told us we just had to have one and we bought one
 		we didn't no more need no new engine give me a break you know so it was it was not good
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and um
