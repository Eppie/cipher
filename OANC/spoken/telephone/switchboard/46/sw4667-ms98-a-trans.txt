 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well i how how how do you feel about that
 	
 	
 		i think it's great um i think like socialized medicine um i think it's a very good idea personally because right now i don't have any health insurance at all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i just know that it's first you know i could get it where i work and but it would be like a hundred dollars a month which is a lot to me
 		and i really just can't afford it uh i have worked places where i had insurance but you know on a more i work for a very small company now
 		and i i realize that you know it would for that to be true you'd you'd have to increase taxes and stuff like that but uh
 		i know other people that are you know in the same situation and when it's just uh i if you don't work for a large company it's really hard to have insurance
 		um
 		i would be willing to you know pay more taxes but
 		uh and i i think it's just i think everybody should have the option to have health care i mean i don't think
 		you know but the only way to do that
 		would be to you know have to tax more
 	
 	
 		yeah there there wouldn't have to be some way to pay for it
 		the
 		the
 		i agree with you that that uh
 		it's no fun to to not have insurance i'm i've had health insurance through my uh
 		either my parents uh employment or my employment for many years but uh now i'm looking as at a
 		layoff situation and i'm sitting here saying well how much is it going to cost me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the uh the prospect of going without health insurance is is uh not very exciting to me either
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		the the problem that i have with
 		with uh
 		universal health insurance is the problem of basically just absolute and complete distrust
 		for the politicians
 		they'll start i mean they could they could say we're going to do it the right way in the beginning and convince me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't have a lot of faith that they would
 		uh
 		that they would not
 		use it as a as a uh
 		oh as a carrot to get votes uh my i called and asked
 		uh the uh unemployment insurance people here
 		i said how long you know what's the unemployed what do i get if i'm unemployed and how long will i get it
 		you know it's very interesting the guy on the other end is a young man he said uh
 		uh with a good sense of humor he says well he says right now it's twenty six weeks uh in periods of severe unemployment and just before an election
 		they will extend it and get all the votes of the people that that like that but he says in your case uh if you're going uh
 		to be needing it in a little while by the time you get to the end of your twenty six weeks uh the elections will be over and
 		we won't have it anymore i can tell you that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i
 		so i'm uh uh i'm i'm uh for the first time i'm i'm seeing things to a uh i'm paying attention to things that i never paid before uh attention attention attention to
 	
 	
 		right yeah you don't really think about it until you you're in a situation where you have to think about it
 	
 	
 		on the other hand like i say they i have i have lived in places where they had uh free medical care
 		and i have to say that that uh
 		that it that it was uh
 		it was comforting to know that you had it but but
 		the way it worked in practice was
 		that
 		uh in order to get enough
 		doctors
 		the uh they used a lot of student doctors a lot more than people would put up with over here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh my wife has dozens and dozens of stories of people that went in for a simple operation and then died on the table because of the incompetent care
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i'm and and she didn't have any axe to grind you know she just grew up in that situation and said well that's the way it is and uh
 		so on the one hand i i'm
 		i'm saying well
 		now i know how people that don't have insurance feel and on the other hand i'm saying uh
 		i don't trust the politicians very much i think that they are very good at at uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i think they're so corrupt that they just use it as a vote getting
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh situation and they don't pay and and they don't make it a very uh
 		there's not a lot of integrity to the things that they do
 	
 	
 		well by the um the same note of what you're saying there could be pros in that situation um
 		for their being
