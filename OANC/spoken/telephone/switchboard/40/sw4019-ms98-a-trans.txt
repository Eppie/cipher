 
     		
 	
 		okay um Chuck do you have any pets there at your home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i do
 	
 	
 		and what kind do you have
 	
 	
 		i've got a male Siamese about a year old here i live alone in an apartment and uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		except for the cat  how about you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  well we have a cat um he's probably
 		oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh uh how's the disposition of your Siamese cat
 	
 	
 		well it's uh you know they're just uh aggressive by nature
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh he's been neutered and declawed so and he's an indoor cat so uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh that kind of calms him down for the most part and uh
 	
 	
 		well yeah he's uh he has been really aggressive at especially towards my little girl for some reason he's uh
 	
 	
 		how about yours
 		huh
 	
 	
 		been so mean to her  and
 	
 	
 		and and you say you had him how long
 	
 	
 		we've had him for about two years and and he was so mean to her
 	
 	
 		two years
 	
 	
 		um right after we first got him so we had him neutered and
 		and declawed and now he bites her he can't scratch her anymore he bites her
 	
 	
 		huh
 		does he bite her enough to draw blood
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah he has a couple of times so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he's a very
 		possessive cat he he loves my son it's his cat and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he's so funny he just follows my son around just like a dog
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		he won't even let my son shower he meows and wants to get in the bathroom and while he showers it's so hilarious
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so he's quite a animal
 	
 	
 		yeah boy i guess well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive i guess  with the daughter he's all right you wouldn't want him to carry her off or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because we just couldn't have him being so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		aggressive towards the girl but
 		uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit and we do keep our daughter away from him so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house
 	
 	
 		is that the only pet that you have
 	
 	
 		it is uh-huh we've we tried a dog um about four years ago and we ended up with a
 		oh Malamute and
 		some other kind of mix anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home so
 		we gave him up
 		and tried
 	
 	
 		well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh we're in a house but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog we couldn't allow him to run free so he was just chained up all the time and it was it was unfortunate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i see
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so have you tried any other pets
 	
 	
 		no no i i live alone in an apartment and uh it's it's not that big that uh although i've heard rabbits are pretty good
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know i i saw something on CNN or on cable here uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		and in houses and they apparently uh especially when they're young when they bring them in uh
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 		and do they they just paper train it or something
 	
 	
 		i guess i guess yeah and i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either because uh
 	
 	
 		yeah  well rabbits are darling that would be fun if you could get them trained otherwise they're pretty smelly  um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep that's right
 		did you see the the CNN the the dog show uh
 	
 	
 		huh-uh we don't have CNN we don't have cable
 	
 	
 		they
 		i see well they have uh
 		uh a Westminster they call it the Westminster Dog Show uh uh i think it's in New York City at the at the Gardens there once a year live
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they had that on last week and that's really kind of something to watch uh it's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
 	
 	
 		oh
 		is that right oh
 	
 	
 		and uh some of the weirdest animals you ever wanna see on there some of them are really beautiful too  yeah so
 	
 	
 		uh
