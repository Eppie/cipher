 
     		
 	
 		so how do you get most of your current event information
 	
 	
 		well during see i'm going to school right now and uh while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i don't watch TV as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it while i'm at work sometimes i on the computer network um
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful
 	
 	
 		i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on
 	
 	
 		that's true i mean my roommates and stuff you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		people around me talk about it and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so
 	
 	
 		right well i'm a housewife i have three kids and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		talking with people and just hearing what's going on but
 	
 	
 		do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the McNeil Lehrer Hour
 	
 	
 		just the regular channel just channel eight that's our channel here that's the um eyewitness news
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh oh channel see channel where i am channel eight's um like public TV so it's kind of different
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		i think i think the uh
 		i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um
 		they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news
 	
 	
 		right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a candidate candidate can get them to follow then the news will
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know kind of publicize his name
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say
 		you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and read and probably read something on it
 	
 	
 		right
 		right and the news too it just doesn't um cover all that many stories i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know and and your catastrophes catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study who's running in our area and i do study what's going on in the economy
 		it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information
 	
 	
 		what kind of uh see i subscribe to like Science News and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about
 	
 	
 		right i
 	
 	
 		but other than that i don't really read i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else
 	
 	
 		i used to read every month a Reader's Digest
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the war when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on but a lot of the times
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper but i just can't seem to find the time if they'd put it out in a video or on  not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well i remember during back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the TV on because that they were going constantly with that stuff
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i um they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of and people said that they wanted to see more on
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		outside of Texas news you know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information
 	
 	
 		if they reported every murder if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess you'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer Olympics
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's they still already they're having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then on on the Olympics you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something
 	
 	
 		i know we're trying to get tickets to it right now yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really that's gonna be crazy that time of year here but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can't believe i mean they're they're uh stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over
 		i guess people want to hear about it also big in big in the news right now is the Braves because they're uh they're in you know training spring training or whatever and they did so well last year
 	
 	
 		right right yeah they spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports and i think that um that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things but
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems like
 		i don't know it's they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know or if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some some channel for it but i don't have cable
