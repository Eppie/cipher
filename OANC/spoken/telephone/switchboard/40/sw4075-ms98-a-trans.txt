 		so
 	
 	
 		part of the city has been given these uh plastic garbage cans where you are suppose to separate and put it out
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't happen to be in the part of the city that does that though
 	
 	
 		right here in Philadelphia the
 		city for residential customers has certain they had a trial section that was having curb side recycling with special containers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then they decided to go ahead and phase it in piece by piece so every year a different piece of the city gets added to the list
 		but in my neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for several years now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you on the first and third Saturdays of every month you take your
 		bottles and your newspapers and lets see bottles newspapers to certain corners in the neighborhood
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there is a farmer's market that collects the plastic they uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it use to be a firehouse
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they are trying to get some urban renewal going in here and trying to make the area safer i live near the University of Pennsylvania where i'm a grad student
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's not the safest neighborhood there is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so they are trying to get urban renewal going and they one of the things that this farmer's market does is collect plastic
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they use that money to keep up the building and organize events and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting the grocery stores here usually have some bins for the plastic bag recycling and some of the plastic jugs and bottle type things
 	
 	
 		right they have that for the plastic bags here too yeah let's see and the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		we don't have very uh i do not know of a very good place for glass here
 		but i don't i would not know where to take glass
 	
 	
 		uh-huh how about aluminum cans do they recycle that
 	
 	
 		oh yes they'll recycle those we have places for those and uh for a while they were the newspapers there were places but i think they had so many newspapers now they are kind of discouraging us from taking them any place
 	
 	
 		right well the only part the thing is that it's probably isn't profitable to just from a standpoint of making new paper to recycle
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but where you end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer
 	
 	
 		yes i know and we have that problem  but uh
 	
 	
 		down home i know my folks
 		um
 		live in South Carolina and they have had some landfill filling up problems and they the county built a new landfill and a site that wasn't geologically proper
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that the landfill consideration is a good reason that probably communities are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away but they just won't have to build landfills as often
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		another things that they are doing now at home but in the offices here is recycling of paper and
 		and that is done by separating the white paper which is i guess is a higher quality
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		from the miscellaneous paper
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and well they also recycle aluminum cans
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		they have every office has two little cardboard boxes for putting in the white paper and the mixed paper
 	
 	
 		oh that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		and big trash cans down at the ends of the hallways that when they get filled up you can go take them down the hall
 	
 	
 		oh
 		but do you all have any place around there for uh used oil car oil
 	
 	
 		oh you know that's one thing that kind of bothered me i now when i i use to get my my oil changed when i go down to South Carolina there has been a Goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car for a number of years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they have pretty economical rates but now in South Carolina there is this
 		mandatory waste recycling fee and my daddy would like to to get the used oil to pour over fence posts
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so you know to make the fence posts last longer and weather better but the oil the the uh Goodyear store won't even
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they say they can't give you the oil they say it's against the federal law now
 		and that they have to charge the waste recycling fee
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		so the only way you can get in South Carolina anyway and they say it's because of federal law you can get your used oil back is to do it yourself
 	
 	
 		huh well we do ours ourself and we take it to a uh
