 
     		
 	
 		okay Liz do you have any children
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i do but they're but they're both out of college so i have one who's uh living in an apartment in another city
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i have one who's actually living with me because um because of the economy and the job that she's got but she's about
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		she's on the verge of moving to her own apartment so what about you
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh well we have five children and  uh their ages range from range from twelve to four
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh little ones then
 	
 	
 		uh yep  and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh some things we like to do together with our family are um in the summer time we like to go to parks we
 		that's our thing we pack up a picnic and and go to every park from Northern Utah to Southern Utah
 	
 	
 		wow oh you mean like state parks that kind of
 	
 	
 		well mostly mostly just play parks yeah so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um with the with the kids and such we don't get a lot of vacationing in so we just like to take little weekend trips and go to parks and such
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you probably have pretty ones there when you were saying parks i was just uh we have a different terrain here so
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		yep when i was a teenager i spent some time with my cousins in Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so i i remember it's pretty  it is flat oh
 	
 	
 		it's flat
 		yes so the mountains would take a while to get around to to find any there are some as a matter of fact but um what other things do the kids like to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well we like to
 	
 	
 		like weekends or during during during the winter do they ski or
 	
 	
 		weekends um
 		no we're not into skiing it's just too expensive we
 	
 	
 		it is expensive yeah
 	
 	
 		we can't do that so  um we like to uh rent videos and sit down and have a video bash pop popcorn and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		hm
 		yeah that's fun
 	
 	
 		and do that so we've done that quite a bit this winter and um we like to play board games together sometimes it's a little difficult with the younger one um
 	
 	
 		yes that's
 	
 	
 		but the three older boys we have some fun times with those after the little girls go to bed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and let's see uh we like to get real wild and crazy and play hide and go seek and  oh yeah things like that
 	
 	
 		all of those things yeah
 		well the twelve year old probably feels he or she's much older than the four year old so there should be different activities in in their minds at at any rate yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		yeah yeah he's really patient though he with us he's he's a real fun twelve year old so
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		but he's rapidly approaching teenagehood so we'll see what happens
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		your first experience with it well it um it's interesting  there's a dramatic change at thirteen and it doesn't end until about twenty five but
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		oh
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		it's part of what's supposed to happen or they can't fly the nest so um that's that's one way of looking at it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		anyway i was trying to think what what what we spent a lot of time well reading i loved to read to the kids when they were when they were younger uh obviously not any more but
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we still we
 		like um Disney movies we really got into them when they were young there were a number of movies that we liked and we just simply liked the experience of the movies and um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		ironically uh my twenty seven my twenty four and my twenty two year old last year for Christmas we rented um Jungle Book you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh how fun
 	
 	
 		and uh i gave one of them Jungle Book and one of them Fantasia for Christmas this year and it was one of their favorite gifts so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh i think that's fun
 	
 	
 		so that's something and besides the  another thing we used to do is watch PBS together which there were a lot of um my son loves science programs and um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we would all just stop and watch whatever the mountain lions were doing or whatever was going on
 	
 	
 		yes i think that is good that sounds
 	
 	
 		yeah which was which was fun yeah and so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		now were you able to get away on some vacations and
 	
 	
 		yeah we did and um and we enjoyed that um my now we my kids back when they were younger younger got did we would go from here to like Colorado and ski
 	
 	
 		oh oh how fun
 	
 	
 		and they did both uh learn to be scuba divers
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh we went once on a vacation with my parents
 		to an island and they snorkeled and that that really got them you know fascinated with the deep and so they actually went through all the course and all the trouble in the middle of Missouri as we were living in Kansas City then
 	
 	
 		oh how fun
 		uh-huh
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and uh went and i don't can't remember what it's called uh but it's
