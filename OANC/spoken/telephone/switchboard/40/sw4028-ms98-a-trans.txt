 
     		
 	
 		okay um i guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits and so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		covering medical costs for yourself or family members
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well um does your company have good benefits in that  in that regard
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i work for a a public school system district and uh  so it's different than a company where
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um
 		the employee must pick up
 		a greater figure in the way of uh costs but overall um i've been pleased with it over the years i think the biggest frustration
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		is because of the cost of insurance
 		going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it has not disturbed me any how about yourself
 	
 	
 		i see
 		uh well i'm my medical coverage is with an HMO um so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's in my opinion that's getting that's bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage um
 	
 	
 		right yeah our district did that
 		for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the HMO and um
 		i i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and i've never seen another bill so i i have to say it really works but again
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join
 		it can be very stressful for you know those people
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's right yeah i'm i'm fairly young myself i've only been
 		when i first started working which three years ago is when i first got into full time employment
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh at that time i immediately joined the HMO and i never really
 		so the only doctor i i've kind of consistently had has been through the HMO and uh you know for me it's worked out real good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right but if you you know have a family and and um
 		everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel
 		knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it i i'm sure it would be very stressful and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know good so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah um like you you mentioned you work for a school system i work for uh Georgia Tech in the research branch and i guess
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh all right
 	
 	
 		another one that that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a as a benefit
 	
 	
 		i do too are you talking about like spring break and right
 	
 	
 		right yeah getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation
 	
 	
 		right
 		it it really um
 		i don't think
 		most of our teachers now i'm not a teacher i am the a secretarial executive assistant but
 		i don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly it is just
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Texas has really um
 		
 
 		you know they want everybody educated no matter what it's costs uh and it it would be just
 		we all look forward to like in two weeks we have spring break and i don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the or the teachers and the staff what do you do there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		well um i'm not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and that's who i work with
 	
 	
 		okay i like
 	
 	
 		um
 		and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study
 	
 	
 		well that's good yeah i would think that that type of
 		employment you're you're
 		one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little lukewarm or something and and um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know it's good that they allow you that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it um as i say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get
 		many days off and um
 		we all look forward to it that's only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh i've just
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		continued to uh stay there
 	
 	
 		okay are there
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits
