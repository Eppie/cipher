 
     		
 	
 		uh hello Steve
 	
 	
 		hello
 	
 	
 		uh you were going to talk about child care
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		we well me and my wife we got a five year old and we have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		kind of like child rearing he we have problems with him every now and then but other than that it's it's pretty he's a pretty good kid
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we uh really don't really have any problem with finding day care for him because i'm in the service and we just take him to the day care on base
 	
 	
 		i see how much how much do they charge
 	
 	
 		they charge about forty five dollars a week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that seems relatively low by commercial standards isn't it usually about sixty to a hundred a week
 	
 	
 		um yeah it's it's pretty pretty expensive on the outside
 	
 	
 		right um so you've you've been you've been pleased with the service
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they do a lot of you know lot of stuff in in their day care and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh how long have you been taking your son there
 	
 	
 		oh about a year now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh before that did he go somewhere else or
 	
 	
 		well before that my wife was kind of stay at home mom now she went back to school so
 	
 	
 		i see
 		you say you went back to school
 	
 	
 		no the wife went back to school
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so he's been there for almost a year now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um gee i think   where where does she go to school
 	
 	
 		she goes to UT uh Arlington
 	
 	
 		uh-huh okay yeah i had a student who went there at one time
 		but i think we're getting off the topic so
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		so um  let's see i mean i i was uh reading i read a lot of articles on child care back when it was when there was a debate in Congress over funding of uh child care centers and what should be done
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i came out uh very much in favor of a tax credit approach where parents would be given a tax credit and they would select whatever services they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize certain providers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh that was i i thought it was important well i mean it is important uh that that people have the opportunity to select the service that they would choose
 		because a lot of kids are in you know in centers well well not really centers but they're being cared for by neighbors and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh that's the sort of they they prefer it that way the parents do because they know the people who are caring for their kids and they don't have to take them very far
 		plus about a third of the kids are in church run centers and there was a big church state controversy over whether the government could
 		fund those are not i think they ultimately decided to but they placed a lot of restrictions on it so it wasn't clear that the church child care centers would want to go to the trouble
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh anyway  i continue to be an advocate of the um of the tax credit approach now myself i'm not married so i don't have any kids and it's not a problem but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		still i know a lot of people that do and uh you know i mean you you you really wouldn't wouldn't um uh well i'm on
 		gee i'm on the benefits committee at the university here and uh child care is a topic of conversation we the university started up a center this year but it's about two miles away from campus and i'm not sure it's going to be real convenient for people to take their kids over there
 	
 	
 		yeah well well when i was stationed in Lubbock Texas uh they had a child care center right on base uh right at the school i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that helped out my wife because she just went part time there and you know take a couple of classes a week but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i think it's a good deal deal but um like you were saying it's about two miles from the school and that's
 	
 	
 		yeah it's just a lot of time
 	
 	
 		it's not going to be very good i think they should talk about putting one right on the campus itself
 	
 	
 		yeah well they say they claim that it's a better environment for kids than to be in with all the students
 	
 	
 		well they kind of have this i think in a different building you know on right on the
 		uh edge of the campus and everything where they really didn't get in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah i am sure that a lot of it had to do with how cheap it was to acquire the building if they would've built a new building then it would've i'm i'm sure it would have cost a lot more than if they uh if they put it down where they did where real estate's probably cheaper
 	
 	
 		in
 		oh yeah um i think they used one of the existing buildings they already had
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you know it it worked out pretty good
 	
 	
 		so so so what do you think about the about the child about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which seems seems most appealing to you
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well i haven't really thought about it like that
 		
 
 		because well you know we pay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think
 		well the
 	
 	
 		excuse me we pay for any you know the child care but we don't pay as much as they do off base
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i think the government should subsidize some of it you know
 		to give the parents you know some break on on the money portion of it
 	
 	
 		well i mean they they yeah the issue the issue is whether they can take it off of their taxes or whether the government decides which centers are qualified the other problem
