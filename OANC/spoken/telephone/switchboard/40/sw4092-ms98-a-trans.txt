 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 	
 	
 		in fact i mean there are people that you know basically just follow them around from city to city on tour
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		selling tie dyes and things like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		because they're on up there in age aren't they
 	
 	
 		yeah they're
 		they're like late forties early fifties but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement
 	
 	
 		okay  all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		they seem to have you know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players they keep on dying and they keep on replacing them and the new ones in his thirties you know
 	
 	
 		oh all right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		because they look pretty rough i mean i've seen like picture of them and they just
 	
 	
 		yeah well they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones i just i i don't know if you saw the tour posters for the Rolling Stones when they last toured but i mean it looked like leather day at the geriatric
 	
 	
 		yeah  i mean because they just
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all their faces were just all shriveled and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yuck looking i mean ugh um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i mean it just just looked like you know they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum well are you into that that
 		rock music you know all that druggie stuff and all that i mean
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you know what i'm saying like i mean like they come on the stage and like you know you
 		they're not even know they're there you know they're just so out of it
 	
 	
 		i prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just
 		uh just so that you know that
 		if they're jamming you know that they don't just lose themselves and you know go into la la land
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i just i just don't like you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that so
 		
 
 		i don't know
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so um have you seen any concerts lately
