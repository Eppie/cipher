 
     		
 	
 		oops hello i pressed the button one so we're recording right now i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		hello
 		that's okay i'm Bill from Raleigh
 	
 	
 		okay and i'm Melanie from Harrisville Utah
 	
 	
 		oh so another one from
 		a different state besides Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah  um okay Bill we're talking about family reunions
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		okay um have you ever had to plan a family reunion
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yes and no it wasn't really a family a planning one but it was kind of uh it was a birthday and i brought a lot of family together then
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		and how did you feel it went
 	
 	
 		it went pretty good i'm i've worked in hotels so i i kind of know how to do these things i used to you know
 	
 	
 		oh
 		all of this planning and and getting together and such
 		um
 		oh let's see what else
 	
 	
 		usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's all of like she she comes from a big family she has like seven sisters i think
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and they show up and all their kids and then all she has uh i have
 		like uh let's see she has four sons and two daughters and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they show up and all their kids so it's a pretty big reunion it's about two hundred people maybe
 	
 	
 		oh my word  oh well what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together
 	
 	
 		um the probably the biggest challenge was uh getting a place where everyone
 		you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i guess probably the most helpful thing was that uh
 		for the rent uh we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that and uh
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		each one of the everybody that showed up donated donated some money for the rent and for
 		for like soft drinks and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill  each person in the family you know brought a dish or some
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's good
 		uh-huh
 		and then did you have a main meal or did everyone just bring it was just potluck uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was kind of potluck you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah show off a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh now how old is she
 	
 	
 		uh she's eighty six
 	
 	
 		oh goodness is she pretty spry is she you know pretty
 	
 	
 		now she does she looks probably like she's in her early sixties
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh  oh well that's neat that she's in good health and that at that age
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh my nickname for her is honey woman that's what i call her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really  well that sounds fun well i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago and there were we sent out five hundred uh announcements
 		because our family is quite large like your your family there and
 		so that was a real challenge and i was president of our family reunion for two years and
 		i wasn't sure i appreciated that duty for two years in a row  but i found that advance planning was the key to success
 	
 	
 		uh also one thing that's helpful and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever but most of all my family lives like in the same county  so it's just kind of like get on the telephone and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh well that was wonderful though
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's so and such days from such and such date and everybody just shows up
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh well that is that is helpful yeah our family ranges from oh goodness
 		well Australia i have a brother lives in Australia to uh Boise Idaho and
 		and uh all kinds of places
 	
 	
 		i would say you're spread out then
 	
 	
 		we are
 	
 	
 		uh my my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever because my dad was in the Army and we were
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we were pretty strung out all over but since they've moved back to Carolina's uh we still are the only ones do not live in in Anson County
 	
 	
 		in
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i live in Raleigh and then my my parents live in Greenville and i have one brother and his wife live in Greenville and um another brother that lives in outside of Fayetteville so i mean we're we're
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we're spread out but everybody else is centralized in in my home town Waynesboro so
 	
 	
 		boy
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		nobody moves away except us  yeah i got out as soon as i graduated
 	
 	
 		they must really like it there
 		yeah  oh
 	
 	
 		just like this town is too small for me good-bye
 	
 	
 		oh  you're ready to move on to big
