 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um  so what do you think of um the way that the government has has moved towards you know getting involved in people's individual  uh lives
 	
 	
 		well uh i did did have you ever heard of a man named Milton Friedman
 	
 	
 		um yeah he's a commentator isn't he
 	
 	
 		yeah well no no he actually wasn't he he's an he was uh
 		he's an anti government type uh fellow he's not really a commentator i don't i don't believe
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but he wrote several books years ago and and he put out like ten different movies on government and and uh
 		and i'm a Milton kind of a Milton Friedman fan and he's anti big government and that's that's my feeling about it i think our government is way too big um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that there's just a tremendous amount of waste i'm i'm a CPA and i can i see the way they uh butcher people as far as i'm concerned and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in in in the in the tax end of it as as far as how they they
 	
 	
 		and so do you sort of lean towards like the libertarian view
 	
 	
 		take money from them
 		you bet i do yep
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		something interesting to me right now too is this presidential campaign uh i i can't believe how
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		tax you you know  our money our life really centers around money the whole thing and you can see uh how
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		tax laws uh in new legislation right now are really a critical big issue
 	
 	
 		yeah and it means a horrible time to have tax cuts at this point
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think you know as far at least as far as our deficit's concerned
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and everyone and every all the candidates just seem to be you now have this bread and circuses policy of
 		you know we'll give you a dollar a day if you vote for us you know
 	
 	
 		that's that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah i mean your kids won't be happy but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you'll be able to buy that that extra six pack of beer at the end of the week
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		the deficit the country's in right now is just incredible i heard a statistic the other day i don't know if this is wrong or right
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but for every man woman and child in the United States they're in debt uh about forty thousand dollars a piece
 		i have a family of five if i had if i had to pay that much responsible for that much debt
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'd be done i'd be sunk
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know i just i there's no way i can generate the income to service that kind of debt
 		i don't know what the heck our government's going to do one time um i i really personally think we're going to have to collapse just like the Soviet Union did
 		or uh i i don't know how how how can we
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it really wouldn't surprise me if that happens in the next twenty years
 	
 	
 		yeah right i don't see it in the near future but uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		and we we are still considered the best credit risk in the world
 	
 	
 		yeah because we write off debts we loaned the Mexican government five hundred million dollars or whatever and forgave them
 	
 	
 		supposedly
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's the same thing with what happened over there um in i and i believe it was Turkey We wanted to use their air strips during the Persian Gulf
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we just went over there and said gee guys you owe us all this money well i tell you let us land our planes here and we'll just forgive it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's ridiculous
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and i don't know if that's really the case you know i'm talking all out of hearsay and conversation from what i've heard uh from other from from other some of my other associates but that wouldn't surprise
 	
 	
 		yeah maybe i would
 		we we've been known to spend a lot of money for expediency in things
 		i uh um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what do you think about the Japanese and the comments they've made recently about the American people i'm not sure that's uh actually a political issue but uh
 	
 	
 		well it in it um
 		i think if anyone but the Japanese had made it if if if an American had said the same thing people probably would have agreed with them
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i'm not so sure they're all that wrong
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah yeah
 		um
 		you know we we we our companies are have definitely become top heavy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um in management um
 		you know our
 		we you know we we you know
 		you know the trend of over consumption since World War Two um
 		you know theory being that that's what what what would be required to make our economy to thrive the best you know that that we you know that the workers just been given that just moved for better and better standards of living
 		and where a bunch of other factors i think you know is just
 		you know it's it's uh we're we're unable to keep on increasing that
 		you know when when you know when you combine with the mismanagement that a lot of American companies have had
 		and yeah i think that you know that's really when he says that they were lazy i think lazy probably wasn't the best term to use
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i think you know you know unwilling unwilling you know unwilling the American workers probably are not willing to do as much work for as little as other country's workers are
 	
 	
 		right
