 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what's your view
 	
 	
 		all right
 		huh
 	
 	
 		what's your view
 	
 	
 		well
 		i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		personally
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		i mean
 	
 	
 		you know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		i don't know coming from Texas you're probably
 		i don't know i i shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think
 	
 	
 		yeah it is but i'm not really from
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not really from Texas i just live down here now i've i've lived down here a couple year
 	
 	
 		oh you're just living down there
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm originally originally from Colorado but
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		yeah there uh there uh there's a lot of hunters here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well
 		i know how you feel i'm uh i grew up in Nebraska and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		man there's no way  there's no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons that's just i don't know
 	
 	
 		i just think i think it's ridiculous i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah it doesn't sit with me very well
 		i don't know i anymore i keep a thirty eight in my truck you know
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah i just about all well i live in Minneapolis and
 		i well actually i live in Florida but i am staying in Minneapolis for a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it's just you you never know who is out there you know it's just for self protection purposes and then
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		of course there's the hunting issue so
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good that do you do Jeff
 	
 	
 		uh i
 		i'm in uh program control for a company up here
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		we do schedules
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		programs programs schedule programs what do you do
 	
 	
 		i'm uh researcher of Honeywell up here
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so uh yeah you guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything or
 	
 	
 		uh i haven't had a chance to do any hunting since i've been down here i don't own a shotgun but i'd like to go bird hunting
 	
 	
 		yeah you know that's something i miss quite a bit
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah uh when i was in Colorado we went
 		dear and elk hunting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you you know quite a bit but
 	
 	
 		all right yeah my brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while
 		and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit but
 		i don't know i guess that what the scale now is it's zero for uh
 		for a complete
 	
 	
 		one for a total ban and uh
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		i guess i am about eight or nine
 	
 	
 		yeah i i agree with you there
 	
 	
 		yeah no doubt about it but uh
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i you know i'm not for it
 	
 	
 		yeah if there is if there's a way you know to limit it
 		to to people that i don't know that
 		they they i guess they passed a couple of uh of laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where they you know you go to buy a hand gun and then they actually
 		uh i know it's this way in Florida they have a waiting period where you buy one and that's a week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that i think that's a pretty good idea
 		uh
 		and that's i don't know
 		that's not a bad idea but then again you can always get around that you could go through the black market like you say you know you always be able to get around
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		yeah it's one of those things
 		but uh
 		i don't know i guess
 		i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like
 		i'm not real sure why anybody would need
 		a fully automatic weapon
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't either
 	
 	
 		you know i'm just not i think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah i fully auto but even well
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i mean a semiautomatic
 		i guess that's
 	
 	
 		it kind of takes the sport out of hunting
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you know it's like
 		what can you do with that that you can't do
 		in a self protection situation with like a seven or a or a or a twenty shot twelve
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you know you might do the same thing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so it's like i don't know it it it does it takes the sport out of it
 		for me i would much rather have a bow any time
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah i i like bows you know i have done some bow hunting and i uh i get into it and i think it's more of a challenge you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know i guess it keeps the shell makers in business
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know
 		anyway that's about where i stand
 		
 
 	
 	
 		me too yeah i am about the same way
 	
 	
 		you uh
 		have you uh eaten yet or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is it seven o'clock there
 	
 	
 		uh yeah it's about seven fifteen
 	
 	
 		you guys central
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		how is the weather up there
 	
 	
 		oh it's it's not too good it's kind of rainy actually you know it's
 	
 	
 		is it
 	
 	
 		around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh i don't know ten or twenty degrees and it's been up around forty so people are
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		people are whining about the rain and stuff but not not too bad about the temperature ice is starting to melt and stuff like that so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i am just up here for the year or so and it's kind of shock to
