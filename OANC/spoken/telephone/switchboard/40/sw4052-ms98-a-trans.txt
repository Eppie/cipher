 
     		
 	
 		so um do you have children of your own
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh how old are they
 	
 	
 		they range in age from twenty four down to five
 	
 	
 		ah so have you had to deal with this uh child care question yourself
 	
 	
 		not not really my wife has provided the child care up to now
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 		uh that certainly is the most straightforward
 	
 	
 		that's the easiest one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you have children
 	
 	
 		i do i have uh one son who will be three in May and uh we're expecting another in May
 	
 	
 		and have you been into child care
 	
 	
 		no not yet although my wife stays home also uh we're starting to look into maybe a preschool
 		a couple of hours a day for the older one next year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		just to give him a little more time with other kids and to give my wife a little more time with the the baby
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but otherwise i i mean even just looking for that has been kind of difficult finding one that you really like and that doesn't have some uh
 		major disadvantages
 	
 	
 		well i think one of the things you kind of have to do is decide what you want out of day care or out of preschool you know do you want a real academic one or do you want one that's more for socialization purposes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know i i think those are some sort of critical issues we see a lot i see a lot of programs that are really geared to get the kids ready for school and i see others that are sort of more oriented towards fun for the kids
 	
 	
 		yes that's true that's true uh
 		and i would tend to lean toward the fun at this age
 	
 	
 		me too  the last thing they need at that age is academics
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean they'll get it eventually anyhow uh how how old are your kids when they started some sort of school
 	
 	
 		well we generally with most of our kids there were well with our oldest one they didn't have kindergarten in Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so we sent her to a private kindergarten and that was really her first exposure
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		with the others we've either
 		with some friends done a
 		a sort of Mother's Day out kind of thing where they took turns
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a couple of times a week or we've actually put them into a little preschool at about age four just for a year's kind of socialization and again to give my wife a little bit of relief
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah it sounds like we'll be doing something similar and my wife was thinking of uh starting up a little preschool
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		maybe just with a few other mothers and it would be sort of a mom it would end up being a mom's day off thing because they would take turns
 		um
 	
 	
 		we did that until our very last one and then my wife kind of said you know i'm ready for a break
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh so that's quite a spread twenty four to five
 	
 	
 		oh we have eight children so
 	
 	
 		wow that's great
 	
 	
 		there's a lot of space in between i mean there's not an awful lot of space in between them
 	
 	
 		um
 		so did now the twenty four year old was was nineteen when the five year old was born has she been at home
 	
 	
 		uh she was in college actually when the baby was born
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		what kind of what's their relationship like
 	
 	
 		very good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it would be
 		very interesting i mean old enough i mean really
 		no sibling rivalry there i would expect
 	
 	
 		no and she kind of really wanted him  i mean she wanted us to have him so she was real excited about it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh she has a child of her own now that's just a couple of years younger than he is
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i always had friends in school who had an uncle
 		uh
 		hold it no that child is
 		wait a minute this should be very simple
 	
 	
 		my son is a
 	
 	
 		that child is your son's nephew
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah i always had friends who had an uncle who was a year younger or the same age and i always thought that was neat
 	
 	
 		well we didn't quite make that but came close so it doesn't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh but they were pretty close at least compared to me and my uncle  whose about forty years older
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		um
 		do you plan to have more children
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		all said
 		um
 	
 	
 		now we've we're into the grand type child period now that's much better
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i would think that would have a lot of rewards does your does your daughter live nearby
 	
 	
 		they live about uh
 		four hours from here they're in San Antonio
 	
 	
 		oh well
 		well that's accessible for a weekend um does she have to worry about child care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh no right now she's staying home taking care of her kids or her husband is in school still
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so she works a little night job to help him through school and he stays home and takes care of the kids in the evening
 	
 	
 		oh it sounds great
 	
 	
 		so they've been able to work that out so far she doesn't wanna go back to work if she can avoid it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah i wish i could stay home with the kid
 	
 	
 		and me too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		but it is nice to i mean i i find it
 		it really gives me peace of mind to know that my wife is home
 		with our son you know as as far as knowing what kind of care he's getting
 	
 	
 		i don't know what you hear in California but you know there's a lot of
