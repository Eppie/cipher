 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh well we have a budget we go by every pay check  since i have been in the service we get paid twice a month so that's what i go by
 	
 	
 		well we
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		we try
 		it's it's not as easy as i had thought it would be but last year i started keeping a total of our expenses and and where they were all going and i have uh a budget book that i use
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you had a people that have personal computers it would be much easier
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um and then at the end of the year i i totaled up what we were spending say for groceries or or entertainment or things like that and then this year i tried to keep it within
 		you know a bounds there and then if there's if we are over budget in one item if we want to apply that to another one i try to do that but it's not always
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		easy when you have extra expenses say the car repairs came up this month things like that that you're not expecting
 		i don't really know how some people stay within a budget
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i can i can understand that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you have kids
 	
 	
 		got one kid
 	
 	
 		one we don't have any because i thought if well if we had a child i don't know what we'd do
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but my husband gets paid once a week and i get paid every two weeks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh then every three months i have a bonus check and but then that's when we we try to put some a side at that time
 		as far as savings uh i take out of each pay check i put so much into a four O one K pan in a profit sharing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then he does the same thing he puts one into uh a stock plan at his company and also into a retirement plan
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because to me that's the only way we're ever going save to be able to save
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i
 	
 	
 		because if the money comes in it's spent if it's not taken out before i get it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i understand that right right now that's just the problem i have and we don't ain't been able to save any because i am putting my wife through school right now
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		through nursing school so it's kind of
 		got to
 	
 	
 		that's very hard
 	
 	
 		maxed out right now but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we try to put a little away every every month you know and plus we've got child care which we got to put in there and everything and
 		we try to put a little away for his you know school education and stuff for later on
 	
 	
 		yeah they say how old is he
 	
 	
 		he's five
 	
 	
 		he's five they say by the time
 		kids his age are ready to go to college it's gonna be about seventy thousand dollars a year for college
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and it's just unbelievable
 	
 	
 		well that's
 	
 	
 		you know i i'm just twenty nine and when i went it was probably five hundred dollars a semester for the tuition books and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah if you yeah it's kind of expensive for her you know going to nursing school nursing school is one of the more expensive ones
 	
 	
 		um-hum where is she going
 	
 	
 		uh U T A
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i'm sure it is
 	
 	
 		and you know
 		the the uh budget part kind of falls in there you know you get unexpected expenses and stuff
 		for that because she has to drive about twenty thirty minutes every day to school and that
 		that adds more to the gas budget
 	
 	
 		oh yeah is she started having do the uh working at the hospitals
 	
 	
 		do what ma'am
 	
 	
 		has she started doing any of work at the hospitals
 	
 	
 		uh no she goes they have a class there every Tuesday and that's what they do and then she'll start during her senior year
 		uh going to the hospital three times a week so
 	
 	
 		yeah because i i've got a friend that just graduated and took her test to to be an R N and i i think towards the last year they were working at the hospitals and then they all had to buy all the uniforms and
 		and all the things which was an added expense
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it is hard i don't know in in compared to say my mother and father
 		living in a budget was no problem
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was just this is what we have and this is what we spend but that's in this time and you know i don't know what it is it's well it's
 		you know my husband let's go play some golf you know something like that or let let's run to the mall with me and and before you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		parent's didn't do that if they didn't have the money they didn't get it and we're not that way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah i understand
 		that's the same problem we fall into you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know when we do have a little extra we try to go out and do a little something you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		be with the kids a little bit during that time and
 	
 	
 		and it's hard
 	
 	
 		kind of a family deal
 	
 	
 		and as far as like the you know with interest rates now as low as they are
 		credit card rates are still
 		sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen percent
