 
     		
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		
 
 		just just as i answered the phone there was there was a voice that came on the line and said
 		you were suppose to you talk about capital punishment how does the law what how do the laws in the different states compare and to be restricted to certain crimes or certain circumstances or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i honestly don't know what Illinois' position on capital punishment is do you know for Texas
 	
 	
 		well i know we're kind of beefing it up now uh the past year or so
 		the people that are on death row and have been for years and years and years they're beginning to go on and executed them now We have the uh lethal injections lethal injection
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		it's going to take at least all ready this year three have been put to death
 		and i think at this point i am for that as long as you know they've had all the chances they need to have on appeals and
 		this i don't see why they should have to and why we should have to support them for twenty or thirty years on death row
 		that once they have been sentenced by a jury of their peers found guilty and then gone through the appeal
 		bit then
 		why continue
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i strongly i strongly agree i think uh well in general i think we have we have a fairly lax legal system as far as protecting the criminal
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh and i can see the the necessity of it
 		but uh
 		i don't know if someone's guilty and there's there's no question if if if there's is no question about it a lot of times you sentence someone to prison and there and there the jury finds them guilt then not in everyone's mind it's not actually settled
 	
 	
 		right i can agree with that That it's
 	
 	
 		so i can i can see letting uh letting for example the judge make the call or or maybe an appeals court make the call and on this it was this not just beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond any doubt
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so under circumstances where it's you know where there is no question about it the person actually did kill somebody and in particularly particularly in some of the more brutal cases or prevalent where they've killed several people
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah i i totally agree i i think it's kind of appalling that some one can commit murder and they know that they probably won't die for it
 	
 	
 		yes Well i know of uh at least two this year that have been put to death have uh i mean they have already they had admitted to it They i mean there was no question and yes they had been going on fifteen to twenty years there on death row
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		uh i think probably Texas is the most lax state there is on this That it just
 		oh wow We do everything else fast
 	
 	
 		
 
 		baby
 		that's that's probably why this was picked as one of the topics because Texas Instruments is in Texas and so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's in the news it's not really in the news much up here i guess it was the Dahlmer case
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that that was in the news everywhere
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now where was that at
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i think that was in Houston
 	
 	
 		so that was in Texas too
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's what i thought
 	
 	
 		i believe so and uh
 		i know we're going through a case right now that uh where parent's starved a child to death
 		and uh
 		i've heard you know people wondering whether you know should these people get the death penalty or not
 		uh i i guess i would feel strongly about that when it involves a child especially they they tied this child
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the police found the child tied and starved and uh there's no doubt a case like that there's no doubt in my mind
 		that these people ought to get the death penalty
 		that uh
 		they did it they did it knowingly
 	
 	
 		i guess that would be that would be the issue and they just tie the child and
 		and were they were they punishing the kid and they don't realize that he was going to die or oh they did
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 		oh they the were just punishing They didn't think far enough ahead i don't guess that you know that he would actually die or that they would get caught They had two of them
 	
 	
 		well see that's i think i would think that differently they had two of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		two children two children
 	
 	
 		two children One did not die
 	
 	
 		one didn't
 		huh
 		yeah in that case he i think he could argue that i don't know if the parents were really intending to kill the kids
 	
 	
 		well could be
 	
 	
 		that would that would seem that would seem like that would that would i would have a harder time saying the death penalty was in order for that
 	
 	
 		well i don't think i would  but uh
 	
 	
 		well
 		no i i certainly think punishment is in order but the death penalty because that's i am not sure that is homicide because they didn't i i it it certainly wasn't intentional homicide
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		Well you may have a point there i
 		it's just that i guess they have gotten so much publicity here but and i have read so much about it and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		just
 	
 	
 		that is
 		that is a tough one
 	
 	
 		but other than that uh you know i just
