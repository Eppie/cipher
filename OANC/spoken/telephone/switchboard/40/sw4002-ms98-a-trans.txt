 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		have you done this very long
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well yeah for the last uh couple of months
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the same with us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well what kind of car would you buy
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of hard to say uh because i don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years
 		we just
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		bought uh a car uh last year and then bought one in eighty nine
 		and uh
 		wait a minute we bought one in ninety we've got three cars of all things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		probably
 		we'll be in at least a midsize four door sedan
 	
 	
 		okay
 		what kind do you have now
 	
 	
 		uh we have a a Mazda nine twenty nine
 		and a Ford Crown Victoria
 		and a little two seater CRX
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it's rather difficult to to project what kind of
 		uh we'd
 		look always look into uh consumer reports to see what kind of uh
 		report or uh
 		repair records that the various cars have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then of course we look into the prices
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		for uh we're not adverse to buying along in the summer
 		when
 		when the cars could get to be discounted because we keep we've begun to keep them
 		uh
 		longer a longer period of time uh i traded off an eighty two Oldsmobile for the eighty nine Mazda
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah we we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life and
 		um
 		we we've had a good many foreign cars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		they they uh i've been extremely we've had three Mazdas we've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've always bought American made cars mostly Oldsmobiles
 	
 	
 		yeah well we we've had uh
 		let's see we had uh
 		we had a uh let me think
 		we had a fifty three
 		and a uh
 		we had uh
 		two fifty threes which is a long thirty minute story  uh and we had a sixty five
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then we had this eighty two
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah we've been real pleased with ours i think we've had one two three
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and most we have a Cutlass we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like a
 		a seventy seven
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then we have a Cutlass Sierra and we've had a
 		ninety eight
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so but i don't know we'll we're going to be in the market for a car probably in the next year and
 		the financing is always something we consider you know the four percent or when they
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		give good financing through the
 		the motor company
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't know what we're going to buy i always thought i would like to try a foreign made car but boy with all the auto workers being laid off makes me feel guilty  so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh my son over in Shreveport uh sold Porsches Audis Mada Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years
 		and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		so
 		uh
 		the first foreign car that we had was a a seventy seven MG MGB
 	
 	
 		oh the
 	
 	
 		was British green racing green with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top
 	
 	
 		ooh boy
 	
 	
 		and uh i drove it mostly
 		and
 	
 	
 		i bet it was hard to part with that
 	
 	
 		yeah it really was my husband was in the Air Force
 		and we got transferred to Okinawa
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so uh we had to sell it which which really really tore me up
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		because uh it was it was great fun and then uh when we got to Okinawa bought well we bought a second hand we uh
 		we decided that uh we had that sixty uh sixty five Oldsmobile and it and it was just too big so we we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States and we got a little Fiat
 		uh and a and the little uh forty horse power Mazda four door sedan
 	
 	
 		oh
