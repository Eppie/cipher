 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay i guess we're recording now so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think they could uh
 		uh our neighborhood they have a recycling program and you've got to pay for them to pick it up and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then they get paid for recycling it so  i don't know
 		if that's very fair or not
 	
 	
 		well
 		Dallas is talking about starting something like that too it's going to be i i don't know if it's three dollars a week i think it's three dollars a month
 		is what we are going to have to pay
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh we do recycle an awful lot of stuff here i i up until a couple of years ago i use to get paid
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		maybe not a lot but i use to be able to find a place that i could get you know a penny a pound for glass and a couple of pennies a pound for plastic and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		something for the newspapers and something for the aluminum cans and
 		nowadays it's like i i can't find one place that's going to take everything
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's
 	
 	
 		and i am trying to recycle my kitchen my kitchen waste by building a compost pile and that's not easy either i wish i could figure out an easier way
 	
 	
 		that's for sure
 	
 	
 		of
 		doing that but uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well we we use to save all our newspapers and plastic and stuff like that and then take it to Wal-Mart because they use to have a recycling bin
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and but they got rid of them because there's a lot of people were throwing their trash and stuff in there so
 	
 	
 		and they just got rid of them well Kroger's uh at least in Dallas Kroger's
 		will pay for aluminum and will collect
 		the glass and the plastic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they don't collect newspaper and they don't collect tin cans and they don't collect cardboard
 		and i know that the place at Galleria there is one bin in their loading dock area that's for cardboard only and they will recycle the cardboard from there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so every once and a while after multiple birthdays and i have all these you know cardboard packaging stuff left over then i go and i recycle that over there but it's you know i have to run around town to get my stuff recycled
 	
 	
 		yeah that i always say they should have just one central place you know where you can just dump them all
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		or in you know cause really i am not really looking for the the money portion of it you know i just
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i use to it use to be a good deal us to give instead of giving my kids an allowance i just told them they could go around the neighborhood and collect things to be recycled and then i would drive them over and
 		they get some money and it was a good way to teach them that their work earned them
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		some money and at the same time it was cleaning up the neighborhood and it was getting stuff recycled and
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard
 	
 	
 		but know it's just
 		you know i can't do that because they don't earn any money for it and i hate to see that happen but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and i would also i'd like to see the state you know they say on all sorts of things you know the they the diaper people advertise
 		that diaper are recyclable and they are working on a program to recycle and well yeah in one small community they're recyclable but there is nothing around that will recycle that or recycle tires or recycle
 		you know uh you know uh they say all these plastics are recyclable but nobody will take anything on beyond a two and so all the bags and all the stuff that's four or six doesn't get recycled
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and uh and you know and if it's recyclable why can't they just throw it in with the rest of the plastic and stuff you know it's just
 	
 	
 		well or if it has to be separated by number why doesn't someone take it i mean i can't find it's i can't even find somewhere that will take the stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i think maybe one thing that we could do to encourage it would be to require uh you know government agencies and stuff were required to use only recycled paper for instance
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and to define recycle paper as paper that includes
 		you know
 		material that had actually been used as paper before
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		one of the things that they do is that they call stuff recycled paper like when they when they make envelopes and stuff they had what they call mill ends
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know the little the pieces from that they cut out from making the envelopes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's what they are recycling cause that never had any ink on it that's what we usually send them to recycle it never had any ink on it they don't have to clean it they put that in with with fresh wood fiber
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they call that recycled paper
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know well then nobody wants to buy my newspaper and nobody wants to to figure out how to
 		you know how to clean up
