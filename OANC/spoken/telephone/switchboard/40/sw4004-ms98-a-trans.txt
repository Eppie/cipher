 
     		
 	
 		so how do you feel about the Vietnam War
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well um  you know i guess that it's pretty deep feelings uh  i just uh went back and rented uh the movie what is it Good Morning Vietnam
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh  got that uh uh some insight there to to kind of help me put together  the feelings i really appreciated the the little uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw that as well
 	
 	
 		English class where the uh the uh fellow just wouldn't do anything you know the guy's gouging gouging your eyes out what are you going to do  you know wait for him to finish me off
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh it it was uh good to remember the uh that that kind of Asian philosophy
 	
 	
 		um-hum  well uh were you over in Vietnam or
 	
 	
 		that uh
 		no no i was kind of an in between uh finally drew a high draft number and you
 	
 	
 		i'm i was much too young i was born in sixty seven so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um in a way both my well uh both my brothers were um draft age but neither of them wound up going over which i think they were very happy for
 	
 	
 		well i personally uh you know uh i just went in limbo i had a passport and was ready to go
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or um  out of the country or or join special forces either one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean i i just didn't know  so uh
 	
 	
 		well um so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there or
 	
 	
 		um yeah just a second
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		you restrict access cause a lot of times people are trying to cut them out okay
 		sure now  well Mark um what was that again
 	
 	
 		um do you think i mean do you think our investment the investment in lives and money was worth it
 	
 	
 		no not not really
 	
 	
 		i totally agree with that
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um well what what effects do you think it's had in our country
 	
 	
 		downside um  uh  well Robert Blythe says we should uh uh
 		yeah go into the grief that that's there and we're our presidents have always avoided that as a country so it's pretty serious really uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a lot of things that aren't being addressed
 	
 	
 		um-hum  well i think i think that you know that's pretty typical of the of the entire entire involvement over in that you know that nothing was really addressed it wasn't it wasn't you know it was never we we announced that we were going to war it was it was such a gradual
 		and subtle you know the um you know increasement of of force that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		Gulf of Tonkin uh resolution and was it a dolphin or a torpedo  things you remember that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i vaguely vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah only only it was foggy and  President uh President finally President Johnson said well they they weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		isn't that something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 		so um do you do you do you think that like our um  for example like in in this this past war the Persian Gulf war
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that uh that  you see it seemed to me that that Bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to um
 		you know prepare the country for war yeah
 	
 	
 		okay
 		hey Mark uh i've got to go um we'll um see you i guess our five minutes are up according to me are they to you
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh i wasn't really keeping count count but i guess that's good-bye
 	
 	
 		yeah okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye
