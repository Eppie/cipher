 
     		
 	
 		do you do for exercise do you do anything regularly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i walk
 	
 	
 		do you uh how often
 	
 	
 		uh about every other day
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		no
 		that's not very much really
 	
 	
 		do you walk very far
 	
 	
 		uh a couple miles
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's
 		that's not bad i mean
 		i know um just probably in the last four or five months i've been able to pick up um
 		i go to a gym and and uh ride the bike and do the what's called the stair master
 		so that's uh i try to do that three or four times a week
 		well
 	
 	
 		have have you done that a long time
 	
 	
 		um uh i i am uh
 		uh i didn't i have a six month old baby he's my third one and didn't do it much while i was pregnant but um but the about at six weeks i really began picking it back up so i've been doing it at least for the last
 		uh last five six months
 		so but before that i did
 		uh i did biking i like to swim a lot too
 		so
 	
 	
 		that sounds pretty good you're
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		you're better than i am i uh
 	
 	
 		it's tough
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it is
 	
 	
 		i i have purchased any number of well i say any number i've purchased three different uh types of exercise equipment uh mainly uh
 		uh a rower and two different uh kinds of uh
 		exercycles but uh i have teenagers and it drives me nuts when i get on and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh somebody's screwed the tension all the way up so you can hardly move
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet well did you do you like the rowing rowing machine because i did that for a while and
 	
 	
 		no i didn't like that
 	
 	
 		i i didn't i just didn't feel like it was doing much for me
 		and i don't i don't know if i wasn't doing it properly or what but
 		i didn't i didn't feel like it was doing much except maybe
 	
 	
 		i didn't like that i uh the uh like i say the
 	
 	
 		maybe for my arms
 	
 	
 		main problem with me is i've got to have something that's repeatable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		walking is repeatable and bicycling is repeatable i i bicycle once in a while
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but if it's any kind of equipment then uh
 		i have uh four kids at home and and
 		they just there's a joy i think in changing the settings
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it takes me a while to get back into it so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well so do you do you enjoy your walking or is it just because you have to exercise you know you need to exercise
 	
 	
 		well there're two kinds one kind is where you just get out and you do it because you've got to do it and the other kind is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is uh actually most of the walking i've been doing these days is is just a bunch that i'm with uh
 		uh a couple of people in my group who we just
 		take off and walk uh
 		uh over to the shopping center and
 		walk through the shopping center and then come back which is about a two mile trip
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's but it's a kind of sedentary job here
 		i don't know about you but uh
 		uh
 		this job just involves sitting in in front of a keyboard all day long writing computer programs
 	
 	
 		ah
 		yeah well i i run after preschoolers  at this point so
 	
 	
 		is is that right so you get uh so you get more exercise than
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		than uh
 		that's a fair amount of exercise by itself right
 	
 	
 		well uh yes and no i mean i don't
 		i mean you know we play around and fool around but i don't i don't ever feel you know i've i've
 		really worked out but i i really have you know first going to the gym was really really tough and i've been doing it like early in the mornings before the kids wake up so
 		but now it's you know i don't like to wake up but once i'm up i enjoy it and i enjoy the the challenge of seeing how much further i can get and um
 		right now i'm
 		you know increasing levels on the bike or increasing time on the the stair master and um
 		so that's
 		you know and i only have a certain amount of time i can do it and so it's okay how many calories can i burn at this in this amount of time so
 	
 	
 		are these are these uh does this gear have some kind of a little uh electronic uh thing uh read out on it
 	
 	
 		yeah um i i'm a member of President's and so the the cycle tells you how far you've
 		you have uh levels that you can um ride on or walk on and it tells you you know how far you've walked or how far you've um
 		biked and how many calories it's burned and you can set it up where you can be going up hills or you can be going just constant level and so it's
