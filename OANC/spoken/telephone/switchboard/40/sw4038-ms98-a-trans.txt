 
     		
 	
 		okay i guess it took so i guess recording has started now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so have you ever served on a jury
 	
 	
 		i served i was in the Air Force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury a lot of the same rules apply have you ever served on one
 	
 	
 		yeah i finally served on one last year i've um been voting for years and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i finally was so  it was an interesting experience i was kind of boring
 	
 	
 		was it civil or criminal
 	
 	
 		uh it was uh
 	
 	
 		a grand jury or something
 	
 	
 		uh it was uh
 		well let's see it was municipal court so it was a combination of uh and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i see
 	
 	
 		so it was a combination of criminal and civil and they had uh well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors and then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was always we was exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences or did you folks do that
 	
 	
 		uh yeah the judge did uh i uh i had a hard time getting seated on a jury i kept getting uh
 		i'd be questioned uh for impaneling the jury and they kept uh dismissing me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		course they don't have to give a reason but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know they want to get the best uh mix for their case so they ask all kinds of wild questions
 	
 	
 		no
 		that
 		that's a science in itself
 	
 	
 		yeah well i kept getting called up for drunk driving uh
 		questions and i think part of it was they didn't uh
 		they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i see because you'd probably be uh too puritanical and to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that was probably it although in my case i might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair or would if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different
 	
 	
 		well i was never there never there for any sentencing uh i finally got impaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh
 		decide the case and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty and he would never vote for guilty
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so uh they appointed me jury jury foreman and i uh didn't think that uh going in without deliberating
 		allowed us to reach a verdict so i told the judge that we weren't were unable unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate so the whole thing had to be tried over again
 	
 	
 		um
 		wow i bet that made him happy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it was uh it was funny
 		the uh i just i i don't know i uh
 		i didn't uh
 		uh i didn't like not being able to deliberate i uh i i wanted to vote guilty for the guy and the other people were kind of mixed
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again cost him a lot of money i'm sure
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh how many members were on the jury was it a six or twelve member jury
 	
 	
 		uh it must have been six
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's kind of curious to me i didn't realize until the uh Wayne Kennedy Smith trial uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a few months ago that they had six member juries i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but uh apparently for some some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i know on a getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous it's simple a simple majority you know rules
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well let's see is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous and
 	
 	
 		a probably on capital i don't know we weren't we  the two that i were on had to do with drugs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we were uh unanimous in acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things
 		the government really failed to prove its case and you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof and we had to acquit him in both cases
 	
 	
 		uh too it was too circumstantial
 	
 	
 		uh yeah it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person but something happened to the camera and the tape and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		all they could do was testify about
