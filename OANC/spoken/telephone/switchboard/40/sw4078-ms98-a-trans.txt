 
     		
 	
 		what do you do there in Lubbock as far as uh recycling is concerned
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you know they actually started and i assumed it was TI wide um uh they they've started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i've you know either computer paper or different types of paper i've had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		less expensively and accomplish the same purpose but i i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in
 	
 	
 		oh yeah what what would be more efficient about it what what
 	
 	
 		um
 		well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or  a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know where i used to work we had what we called tree boxes that's just what we called them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they were recycled cardboard they were eight and a half by eleven and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there
 		and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box so not only is it you know i think more people would take advantage of it and use it
 		uh i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we're paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		kind of type thing so
 	
 	
 		i see yeah i i i i uh i was gonna say because i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for it says paper on it you know and uh if
 	
 	
 		right
 		but
 	
 	
 		if i have a if i i printed up something that i don't need it just chunk it in the in the paper
 	
 	
 		right but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together and whereas if you had a box that was preset and it got full you closed the box it's already bundled it's already done for you
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		hm
 		certainly that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		so you're saving a lot of time and effort i just need to put it on paper and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess recommended it to somebody and see if they think it's feasible
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um what else do they do in the Dallas area
 	
 	
 		well um as far as TI's concerned i'm not sure um and
 		uh i've heard uh you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and i've heard in residential situations uh like in Plano
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um that they are doing uh stuff like having recycle picked up
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		where uh the city uh i guess the sanitation department uh as part of their responsibility picks up
 		uh the recycled items as well you know the plastics and the paper  uh and uh aluminum and um
 		the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them and then the the uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything doesn't really cost the uh department
 	
 	
 		anything extra
 	
 	
 		right they don't pay they don't pay for the recycled items
 	
 	
 		that sounds good there's i i've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where
 		you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the uh even uh
 		there are areas that can recycle the the tin cans like your you know vegetable things come in and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i i've not done that but that's kind of what i wanna set up so because we do go through aluminum cans you know that's probably the one we use most
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but
 	
 	
 		well what what what kind of uh services do you have there in Lubbock as far as uh where can you take your recycle items i i lived in Abilene for a uh i went to school there at Abilene Christian and i it was so hard to uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		find a place
 	
 	
 		you know if you if you wanted to recycle your newspapers it was impossible
 	
 	
 		well um
 		uh
 		they they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers aluminum cans
 		those are the two major items now we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to they have uh dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um but i i don't know i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		i do that i think people are becoming more aware
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know of of the waste and you know i i like to see you know you you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper and you know so you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know like maybe it's making an impact
 	
 	
 		do you tend to buy more recycled items that if if something uh in the pack says recycled and something else doesn't do would you tend to chose the one that does or
 	
 	
 		i'm not as good about searching something out like that but if i'm there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you know that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible as a citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start
 		packaging it that way
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 	
 	
 		so um
 		you know they're getting away from the styrofoam
