 
     		
 	
 		okay i guess we're on uh capital punishment uh
 		my my feeling by the way is that i think there is a need for capital punishment i don't think it ought to be applied to every crime obviously but there is a need how do you feel about it
 	
 	
 		oh i believe there is you know there is a need for it like you said it shouldn't be applied to every every crime you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i feel like you know they need to
 		instead of giving the people on on uh
 		you know like death row and stuff just leaving them there and sit there and make taxpayer pay for it i think they ought to do something about it
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it does does get uh strung out too long that they uh they keep people there ten twelve years uh uh that seems to be the norm
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		i i don't know how effective a deterrent it is when when that happens uh but
 		more and more people are being executed for crimes i think down in Texas uh just today or yesterday didn't you have one an execution down there
 	
 	
 		yeah we had uh one just yeah couple days ago
 	
 	
 		yeah well they haven't executed anybody in uh in our state of New Hampshire since i think nineteen forty four or somewhere around that time frame it's it's been a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we do have the death penalty but uh they don't use it very much instead they sentence them to life and uh we end up as you say uh fitting the footing the bill the next forty or fifty years
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's what i think that they need to do something to change that because
 		i don't think the taxpayers should have to pay for that guy to stay in the stay in there for life you know
 	
 	
 		i think one interesting question would be uh
 		uh you know as far as circumstances uh i think we agree if somebody you know is involved with a premeditated murder or you know a cold blooded first degree murder they deserve the death penalty that's in my opinion i don't know how do you feel about that
 		if they take another human life you know and they've they've planned to do this
 		or they're doing it for pay don't you think that deserves the the death penalty
 	
 	
 		it sure does
 	
 	
 		now how about drug dealers where they don't directly take a life you know it's not like they're pulling the the the trigger on a gun or or something like that what do you think about uh major drug dealers getting the death penalty
 	
 	
 		well that not they're partly you know they're a lot responsible for it because they're the ones selling the drugs to the to the uh
 		dealers out on the street you know and i think they they need to get capital the capital punishment
 	
 	
 		i think capital punishment in those instances is probably even more effective than for uh the just the common street criminal that kills somebody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that person probably isn't thinking too much about it but these major drug dealers uh you know they got some brains they wouldn't be in the business if they didn't have and if they're threatened with the death penalty i think it might make a difference on them
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i think it would too you know sometimes i think they ought to just  take them out and shoot them and just you know but uh
 		that's my opinion on some of the cases
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because i think drugs is a bad deal and stuff
 	
 	
 		that's right it certainly ruins a lot of lives uh whereas a you know somebody that uh
 		is holding up a bank and shoots somebody effects a fairly small circle of people i mean the relatives and friends of the person that was killed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but but a drug dealer a major drug dealer is effecting what thousands of lives
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and in effect causing some of them to die
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and you know it's
 		especially i just saw something on TV tonight on the news about LSD in a school over in Dallas so
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yep so it's
 		effecting it's way down there in the high schools and stuff and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think drug dealers need to be sent to prison for life imprisonment and stuff you know or given the death penalty
 	
 	
 		yeah and and
 		uh-huh
 		that LSD even gets into the grade schools when they sell these uh stickers they look like uh i guess they're dots on a piece of paper or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know that's really that's really a crime to give it to the young kids like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i guess we've talked about all we can on this topic what do you think
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		okay well it's been nice talking with you hope you have a nice day good evening talk to you later bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay you too
 		all right bye
