 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well how do you feel about trial by jury
 	
 	
 		i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently uh
 	
 	
 		in what way
 	
 	
 		in that it seems to me they're swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that's presented
 		i have uh very little regard for the law
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's presently practiced
 	
 	
 		i mean do you do you feel they're they're swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
 	
 	
 		i was thinking primarily criminal cases
 	
 	
 		um-hum so you think that i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum that's a concern of mine uh
 		i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh you know doing the sentencing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be
 		uh i like the idea of juries of your peers um in that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the decision making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that
 	
 	
 		yeah my question i guess is are they really your peers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i'd agree that that's that's definitely a problem
 	
 	
 		uh too often i think they're not and uh when you you when you are
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		selecting a jury and you're doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know that's a matter of concern to me too uh i think that uh in such cases uh
 		they're not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh now i happen to know several judges and there's one that i'd feel uncomfortable but has  doing sentencing without the jury
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'd feel a little bit uneasy about but the other two i feel uh would give either
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know the the plaintiff or the defendant the the full benefit of the law
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i guess that's what i am concerned with
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i guess i i definitely agree with you but sentencing the well what i don't like about uh sentencing juries doing the sentencing in that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think it becomes a lot less the the the the same crime gets unequal sentences
 	
 	
 		this is very true
 	
 	
 		i uh i i think there is more of an ability of you know you know selecting selecting selecting a jury two two different juries that would
 		most of the time come up with the same idea  the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in
 		in trying to
 		gauge the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and and have that
 		that measure stick across the board
 	
 	
 		yeah and you do see such uneven uneven sentencing uh you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such i mean
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where uh it would appear that the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty five years and the other one was sentenced to life for something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		of course a lot of that's also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer
 	
 	
 		isn't that the truth
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there are times when is it uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh goodness my mind's gone blank it uh Othello
 		you know where he says kill all the lawyers  every now and then one is tempted to feel that way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		but i it's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know amateur as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah i i agree with it yeah they and they'll admit to you that they cannot don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of of letting allowing themselves to believe their client client innocent or guilty it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		through argument that the
 	
 	
 		and they're very effective too uh even i've been involved  slightly slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty but uh his attorneys gotten him off
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge
 		so i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh
 		yeah this is a little bit of the subject but one one thing that i that i really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences
