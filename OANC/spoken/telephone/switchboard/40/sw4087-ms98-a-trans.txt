 
     		
 	
 		well do you have children
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		you don't have children
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		and my children are in their twenties now so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		child care is something that i i no longer fortunately have to take care of but it is something that was hard
 		at the time just finding finding sitters i
 		did not work though so i didn't have to uh
 		have to worry about you know
 		all day during the day which i think is a real problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah i agree uh
 		cause  i suppose when when i do start having children uh
 		i'd like to stay home for a while but uh
 		you know eventually i'd i might have to put them in day care to work
 		i and i think it's hard to find um good day care because just the other night um on the news in Milwaukee um
 		they're closing down a day care because um
 		the lady who owns um slapped a child
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um she had a lot of um
 		like um
 		um what did she have um like
 		tickets against her um saying that the she didn't have proper food um prepared for them
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and that it was just dirty and
 		and she didn't take very good care of the kids and you know you don't want to send your kids to place like that
 	
 	
 		no it's really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if people are doing it
 		instead of grandmothers and aunts and you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that kind of thing where where people are doing it for money
 		and trying to make ends meet then it's it it becomes an entirely different thing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and we keep reading about all these different things that go on child abuse and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and people with criminal records etcetera i think it would be very frightening
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and i know some companies have child care facilities at the company but not many of them do
 	
 	
 		right or you have to um
 		it's pretty expensive  i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the college i go to they have uh child care
 		um there but you still have to pay
 		you know it doesn't come with them
 	
 	
 		do you know how much it is
 	
 	
 		no i don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but that's what i've heard is that that you've got to earn an awful lot i mean you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a lot of times the wife's money basically covers what you have to pay out so that doesn't help
 	
 	
 		right it's like uh uh if you do work  most of the money goes back into taking care of your child so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you might as well stay home if you're married
 	
 	
 		yeah  that's right well i i and and uh and then there's the question of you know if
 		what what to look for what's what's going to be uh what's going to be
 		a good place and uh do they
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		do they turn out as well as the ones where the mother stays home that's that's a really difficult issue i know
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've heard a lot of things about that too um
 		with some people say  it's not healthy for your children to be in day care
 		and you know other's say it is so i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you you haven't decided yet huh
 	
 	
 		uh no
 	
 	
 		no i think it's going to be hard i feel like i was i was lucky to get to be at home and
 		there were a lot of times that it was boring and it and it certainly isn't true is true that didn't
 		didn't set me up for a career but at the same time uh
 		it felt good to be there when they got home from school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		those were the stories that
 		that that i got to hear it was even hard to get their father to
 		get to hear them you know they would come home and they'd say all this and then
 		later on you say well tell dad about you know and they go oh i already told you you know it all gone kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh and that parts good and you get to see them as they progress etcetera
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but at the same time if you don't have enough money or if you are trying to build a career
 		you know then you have to give everything up just to stay home and i think that's a real question
 	
 	
 		yeah that is it's a tough decision
 	
 	
 		and uh do you know uh
 		you say they have it at school is it for the students or for the teachers or for both
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um  i think it's
 		for for the students
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know if it would it's it makes sense to have it for the teachers too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um
 		i'm not really sure  i haven't looked into  it i don't need it
 	
 	
 		well what about you and your own background did did your mother or father stay home or did did they work or
 	
 	
 		um yeah my mom stayed home um she had four kids and
 		she stayed home with all of us until i got into about kindergarten and then she went um back to work after
 	
 	
 		and so you so you were in school
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and when you came home from school was there some one there or was uh what happened
 		i mean did she get off when you got home or was there some one taking care of you like an older brother or sister or
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		do you remember
 	
 	
 		for a while she was there
 		um when i got home but then um and she started working later until like four and i would come home first and i and my brothers and sisters were all older than me so
 	
 	
 		so you had there was some one there to take care of you yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum yeah there was already somebody home
 	
 	
 		yeah cause i think that's another
