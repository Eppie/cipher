 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um what does your does your community do anything about recycling
 	
 	
 		we have been working hard to get a program of recycling going
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the best we've been able to do is an area that has uh storage bins uh for um bottles and uh plastic
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but people need to drive it there we don't we haven't moved to having uh picked up with the garbage yet
 	
 	
 		right
 		Plano um
 		oh it's probably been i guess i started in September um
 		started where they gave every every household a bin that you could do newspapers aluminum uh bottles with code one and two on them
 		and uh glass and uh it has been really really successful um
 		they said that they figured like twenty five to thirty percent participation and it's been like forty five percent and um they also do um
 		they pick up on another day of the week for um
 		lawn debris that could go in like a big compost
 	
 	
 		here uh they don't take uh lawn debris to the landfill any more
 		we need to load it into cars and take it to a general site where it gets recycled uh but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think they're they're not making it easy for the uh general public to do it here i mean they they
 		you have to haul everything yourself which can be a mess when it comes to uh yard waste in particular
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		how big is your community
 	
 	
 		well we've got enough people we've got a community of about eighty five thousand
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they're just very reluctant to to get moving the way in which i would like to see them moving
 	
 	
 		um-hum the i yeah that's i i would like to see the manufacturers really uh
 		you know the only thing that they recycle right now is is plastics one and two and i would like to see them recycle either more
 		plastics um you know up to code seven or eight whatever it is or see the manufacturers using
 		more of the um
 		uh code one and two that i i mean i don't even know of a place to drop off the other the other ones
 	
 	
 		um did did did you tell me that you're recycling newspapers
 	
 	
 		but um
 		we're recycling newspapers aluminum
 		um i mean like aluminum cans like soup cans and all that not just you know soda pop cans um glass and uh the plastics
 	
 	
 		boy you're you're further ahead here most people are recycling aluminum soda pop and beer cans
 		uh for the money that they get out of them and that seems to be the only incentive on that side
 	
 	
 		right
 		it sure does take a lot of lot of cans to do that that to make anything though at least down here it
 		i i took like two garbage sacks full i mean just like paper sacks and got like a quarter and i thought this just really isn't worth my time
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is but there are a few people who who
 	
 	
 		so
 		that that go through the dregs yeah
 	
 	
 		they will manage it what we've done at the church is to have uh people bring the stuff to our church
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then there're couple of people who who crunch them down and then
 		uh take them to a recycling center and then the money is used for uh the outreach program to provide food
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		and so that has been an incentive uh within uh our our particular church
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but newspapers the city doesn't want and none of the uh recycling
 		places want them because they say that they're it costs them more to recycle than than they get out of them so we're stuck with newspapers
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 		really
 		we we i know uh even before this took place um in September
 		the our like our boy scouts were doing paper you know paper drives and even when i was younger um i remember having paper drives at school and um so
 		i know it it seems like for you know a long time the the Dallas area has been doing some kind of paper recycling i don't know what they did with the papers you know twenty thirty years ago i'm not sure
 		but i know now i mean we have a lot of um
 		stores  Wal-Mart is down real big down here and and their their paper sacks that they do are all you know out of recycled paper and we have a lot of lot of companies
