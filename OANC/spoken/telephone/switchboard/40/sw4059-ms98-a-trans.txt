 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		think about what nursing home
 	
 	
 		well  my parents were both in them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my father-in-law and it's a tough decision to make
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because boy it really confines the uh the people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		usually they don't care for it  and kind of put you on a guilt trip
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh have you had any experience with them
 	
 	
 		well uh this my grandmother in fact uh has a personal care home and she keeps a couple of elderly ladies in her home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i live i live with her and so uh it's it's uh my mother also does the same thing
 		and uh it's uh
 		i think the quality of care they get is a a lot better uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and a lot more personal but uh
 	
 	
 		but it's still still not like home
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no but uh i think it's uh quite a bit better than than a nursing home i i've just seen
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		people just go down hill when they uh go into a nursing home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that seems to be
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but uh you know and it's hard to really
 		know what kind of a home is run
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		unless you really know someone that's in there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		
 
 		you have to kind of take that with a grain of salt too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that uh  yeah they may say it's real bad
 		uh just because they don't like it in there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whereas it's you know usually pretty good
 		uh  uh the one my father-in-law was in had uh
 		oh God  entertainment every afternoon of some you know bingo or cards or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh and it's easy to check out the meals you know just go up there during uh meal time if you can stand it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because they don't eat that too well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		go uh always you always have to check it for cleanliness too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm sorry what was that
 	
 	
 		well you have to make sure they're clean
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and they just had a incident in uh Dallas here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where the guy's suing the nursing home
 		he came in at ten in the morning
 		check on his mom
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she was sick
 		and uh went up to the front desk and said what's wrong with my mom and they said what is she sick
 		we didn't know that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and here she died two hours later
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so you know
 		and  well there's an awful lot of variables in them
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i've seen some good ones and uh
 		i've seen some uh my other grandmother was in one and it was
 		i guess they it wasn't too bad but she uh she was a good way away from her family and uh
 		kind of by herself there and it was it i didn't really like going there at all it was
 		it was not a pleasant experience but uh i think there're some good ones out there's some here in Atlanta that are closing down  it's
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		apparently a shaky business right now
 	
 	
 		well i think Medicare and Medicaid payments are uh
 		kind of tightening up on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		you know in some of them some of them try so darn hard
 		but caring for an elderly person who might be forgetful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is ever ending
 	
 	
 		yeah it is uh one of the ladies my grandmother has is apparently
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		showing some signs of Alzheimer's and uh she'll
 		my grandmother'll put her to bed and uh she'll get up you know anywhere from five to ten times and wonder where the bedroom is and you know that kind of thing so
 	
 	
 		well it's around the clock care
 	
 	
 		yeah it uh it takes a lot of patience
 	
 	
 		yeah an awful lot
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		and and gentleness too
 	
 	
 		yeah she  she's she's pretty good with them though she does a real good job
 		and uh oh i you know i would i would probably throw up my hands and quit but she just you know turn around put her put her back to bed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know which is good
 		so i i hope i can provide that kind of care for my grandmother you know she's still going pretty strong but uh
 		uh i i don't think i would
 		wanna
 		turn her over to a nursing home i i'd like to be in and  i think that's the position of a lot of people but they can't afford it
 		you know
 	
 	
 		costs a bunch
 		my mother-in-law is uh eighty two
 		and we'd probably put her in the same home that
