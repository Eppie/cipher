 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay now it's Sandy right
 	
 	
 		all right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Sandy um what kind of music do you like to listen to
 	
 	
 		i like Country and it's really hard to find people that enjoy country music
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		in San Diego uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in my age
 		because i'm twenty two and most people my age like hard rock and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		not me  i think it was the stupidest thing ever invented
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i still like country music and
 	
 	
 		do you oh
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of hard for me to find people i agree with on music
 	
 	
 		oh um now have you lived in California all your life
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		no you just moved there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i i have to be here right now because my husband's in the Navy
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i'm going home first opportunity i get
 	
 	
 		now where's home
 	
 	
 		Arizona
 	
 	
 		oh okay so country music is prevalent in Arizona
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i i was born in a little tiny town that that's all they have
 	
 	
 		is it oh
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it has a population of about three hundred people and all they know is country music
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean they still have barn dances and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh how fun oh
 	
 	
 		yeah it is pretty fun
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i don't blame you uh my husband's in the Navy Reserves and so he's going out to San Diego in about three weeks for his two week
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yearly stint so
 		i'll be missing him then but
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband's leaving March twelfth he has to go out to sea again
 	
 	
 		oh and how long does he stay out
 	
 	
 		so
 		well usually they stay out six to nine months but this time they're only going out for i think it's two weeks this time because they're just they're just doing their sea trials making sure they're ready to go out to sea again
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh well thank goodness
 		uh-huh
 		oh i think that's terrible oh
 	
 	
 		yeah it gets kind of monotonous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i incorporated him into country music because he didn't he didn't like it when we got married but since he married me and i was the country girl that's all i have going on at home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so now he's gotten where he really likes country music and for my birthday he went out and he got me a brand new pair of Tony Llama boots and he bought himself a pair too and took me out country dancing
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 		oh boy  so he is real country now
 	
 	
 		yeah and all his friends tease him on the ship
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you sure cowboys know how to swim
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		he he gets upset about it but it's funny
 	
 	
 		that is that is well out here in Utah we have a lot of country and we live kind of in the country it's by Ogden Utah i don't know if you know Salt Lake City
 	
 	
 		my my dad lives in Salt Lake
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well it's it's about a hour north of Salt Lake so we're out here in the country and we hear a lot of the country music
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact i work in a bakery and the baker comes to work at four o'clock in the morning and i come to work at six o'clock in the morning
 		and he just has the country music just a blasting and he just rocks and rolls in the bakery  to country music
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah i know how that goes i think country music's the only thing keeping me sane with these kids
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i i bet that's really hard being their alone with all those with the two little ones
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it is but
 		i don't know it's worth it
 	
 	
 		way it's a way of life for a while huh
 	
 	
 		it's worth it to me
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good
 		well um my favorite kind of music is New Age and it's that sounds like it's hard rock and roll but it's not it's the
 		oh the synthesizers synsi synthesizers and all of that
 	
 	
 		yeah and it kind of has a bluesy mix to it yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and it's just beautiful i love it i
 		i find it so relaxing and i do i'm getting beginning to like country music more and more since my boss has it on all the time but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but my very favorite is that New Age i like my favorite recording artist is Yanni and he's not he doesn't make you yawn  he
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you know who Mariah Carey is
 	
 	
 		um i have yeah i've heard of her in fact i was watching the Grammy's and i i saw her on the Grammy's
 	
 	
 		i don't particularly like her kind of music but she's got a couple songs that i i i can listen to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know without going totally bonkers
 	
 	
 		yeah she's not too wild
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah but
 		i don't know i just i guess i'm kind of the only country one that got left
