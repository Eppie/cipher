 		hello Paul
 	
 	
 		um  yeah i guess when i uh
 		first i guess i have mixed feelings about this uh
 		subject when i first heard about it um i thought it was kind of a neat way of uh
 		
 
 		screening uh
 		uh screening for potential problems
 		good way for companies to weed out people with drug problems but since then i've been hearing uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i read an article in the Wall Street Journal last year that talked about um the different results that they get from uh different labs and that uh many labs will give uh false positives especially some of the
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the less expensive ones and that people have been denied employment on this basis
 	
 	
 		well the reliability seems to
 		
 
 		not be too great um
 		i don't know
 		
 
 		i'm kind of like you i have mixed feelings but all in all i think i'm for it  uh  i really do um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because we lose so much
 		time and what have you with the the drug problem
 		and it's just so prevalent nowadays that uh
 		i think it's only fair for the uh employees or the employers to uh
 		have some kind of guidelines to go by
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but like anything else this can be misused
 	
 	
 		yeah there's a i know some employers have had have been able to uh reduce some tremendous problems they've had with
 		employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if you're driving a train or plane or something of course there'd be increased need for it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		one thing that always kind of bugged me about it was uh
 		there's they most of them don't test for
 		actually the number one drug problem which of course is uh alcohol abuse
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and of course that you know everybody talks about all the other drugs but uh
 		i i understand alcohol is really still the number one health problem and the number one abused drug in in our country
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it seems kind of too bad that that one's tolerated while other ones are are you know are the ones that they focus on
 	
 	
 		well it is in every situation that uh alcohol is
 		more acceptable to people it seems than the other quote drugs but uh it can do more
 		harm with the uh i don't know we just seem to have a rash of drunk driving and killings around here lately and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well see now in Texas uh didn't they only recently ban open containers in in vehicles a few years ago
 	
 	
 		yes yes but we aren't very uh we aren't very hard even on the you know when they're picked up for drunk driving time after time again
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		this is a real problem here that they get a little slap on their wrists and there was one man here that had forty two DWI's
 	
 	
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		and the only reason they finally came down on him he finally did kill someone
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and an innocent bystander and when looking back he had forty two convictions and yet he was still walking loose so we've got problem here with the alcohol especially that uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right yeah
 		yeah i expect possibly in Texas it's uh
 		you know a an attorney knows they get in front of a jury and the jury will be thinking well i've done that before or he's just a good old boy you know
 	
 	
 		the good old
 		yeah good old boy stuff  you know well this is yeah this is natural this is tell me what do you expect
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah right what else how else do you drive in your pickup down the highway
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i'm afraid you know it may come out with some of these other drugs too that uh i know i have some friends whose children of uh you know it's they use cocaine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's acceptable it's becoming acceptable to them that well you know they're not
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		they're not hurting anyone else and i thought where have i heard this before  and i'm afraid that's what we may be
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		facing in the very near future
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		other than that i don't know because i don't  drink and i don't do drugs and it's uh so neither is really acceptable to me
 	
 	
 		well same here
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh then the work place it's just i don't know what is well we really infringing on other rights or their
