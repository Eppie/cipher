 		that said what does how does he treat the other people
 	
 	
 		just uh stays away or runs
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		usually but he follows he'll follow my oldest son around
 		you know when he's in the house he'll come up and he'll jump on his lap
 		but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are you doing
 	
 	
 		did he raise him or something
 	
 	
 		and
 		he he's yeah we bought the cat for him and so he's he's been the one that you know spent the most time with him
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i i've never owned a cat like that i've had cats growing up all the time and you know they're usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		so it's a weird cat
 	
 	
 		huh we have a a mutt well we we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from  uh some lady
 	
 	
 		a mutt
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she uh a lot of people uh uh drop off abandoned abandoned pets at her house
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and she used to work for a veterinarian veterinarian so she would spay uh neuter them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		give them all their shots and we saw an ad saying it was free so we went down there and picked it up and it's been an excellent dog but this is my first dog i've i've had
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and we got it because well my wife stays here at home alone while i go to work so that's mostly why we got it to keep her company while i'm away at work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so that is that kind of your child right now
 	
 	
 		um yeah right now it it is it's kind of good training i mean we've been trying for kids but right now we haven't had any but
 	
 	
 		you feel like
 		
 
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's pretty good training i think i mean it it keeps us on our toes
 	
 	
 		have have you had dogs before
 	
 	
 		uh my brother has um we didn't do a lot with them um i never felt it like it was mine or anything you couldn't do anything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i mean it's a bit more responsibility
 		when it's yours and not your brother's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well i just um  we've you know when i was growing up i had we always had a dog
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		and we had mostly well not not mutts but mixes you know like one or one or two mix
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs
 	
 	
 		that's what we found ours is uh like a Cockapoo i think it's half Cocker Spaniel and half Poodle but it's a really good dog
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know they seem to be i mean listen better or something is your cat a purebred
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no no it's just uh
 		an accident  from a friend from uh my son's friend down the street their their cat
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens and
 	
 	
 		would you ever want a dog in the family
 	
 	
 		um we i would we um
 		we had a dog that was a um
 		mix between a an Alaskan Malamute and a Labrador
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and  i should say a pup and he was just too big for our kids when we got him and we
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet and and it was a dog that we gotten
 		he was just he was just too big um the kids couldn't handle him and i was still going to school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and my wife was working and i was working and so we just didn't have time to really train him so he was kind of just there you know he's too big for the kids to handle so he was just tied up to a post
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so we gave him to uh i don't know if you've there's a place out here on it's called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville and they have um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess it's kind of an animal shelter but he just takes a few of the animals in and some he destroys and some he keeps
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we took him up there and he ended up keeping him
 		um
 		because he's had him for six or seven years we we've
 		saw him just a oh i guess about a year ago and uh i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away and so we asked him about it one day and he said yeah he's been the best dog i've ever had in my life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		wow
 	
 	
 		just goes everywhere with him i he would've been a great great dog
 	
 	
 		they just need a lot of time
