 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is all you need
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i think just one is all you need
 	
 	
 		yeah i pushed a an auto dial um so do y'all have a family budget
 	
 	
 		well we don't right now we're planning on setting one up as soon as i can get some you know some better ideas on how to do that have you used one before
 	
 	
 		yeah we um a couple of years ago took a class um that was offered was a guy at our church um called Mastering Your Money by Ron Blue
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh yeah i've heard of that
 	
 	
 		you've you've heard of him it's really it's been really good we've um we're on a a monthly budget and pretty much we we designed our own um
 		ideas of you know these are some set things that that we know we're gonna spend and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the rest we have in categories but for the most part it's been somewhat discretionary um
 		the like right now a and the next month will probably be a little higher in clothes if we buy for spring and summer and so
 		we may spend a little more there and a little less in another in another area
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um but it's worked really well we've been able to save um
 		you know what we've wanted to save and and uh pretty much been able to do what we've wanted to do and we have some long term um goals that we want to do
 	
 	
 		have you put money into those categories or what what do you do for that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		well  we um
 		i i keep the books and i'm the one that writes all the um all the bills and stuff and pretty much um i just know what i have to spend  no you may not
 		um i know what i need to spend or what i have to spend and i just try not to spend it i know  some people do um  envelope envelope envelope
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		systems and stuff but i don't find that works real well for me
 	
 	
 		well do you have any money that you uh specifically set aside for certain savings uh you know savings objectives
 	
 	
 		yes we have um  we have like a college fund for our kids and we have um a house fund and we have a car fund and
 	
 	
 		i mean where do you put that money
 	
 	
 		uh we put it in a savings account or we have some of  it in CD's and stuff but we we take that out every month and then divide it up into the categories that that we have
 		and we also we have a category of of short term goals that we put aside money each month and if we want to like right now we're getting ready to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		put up a fence and that will come out of there it's money that we haven't budgeted for
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it you know things you know things like that and then um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's where it will come from and if we don't have the money in there we have to wait until it's you know up to where we where it needs to be
 	
 	
 		that's probably the key part right there is waiting until you get the money that you budgeted
 	
 	
 		i i'm sorry i didn't i didn't hear you
 	
 	
 		i say that's probably the key part right there is waiting until the money that you've planned for is there what about credit cards do have you do you still use those or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		is that part of the system to discontinue that
 	
 	
 		well he recommends that you don't um or he helps he recommends that you you get them down we we've never been real big credit card users and we always pay it off um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		every month if we use them um we're not real big cash carriers so occasionally we will spend or we will you know put uh a meal on it or um
 		i don't know sometimes i'll do mail order stuff and i'll put it on there but it we always it always we will always work it out where
 		where we pay it off at the end of the month so we don't put just a whole lot on there we don't use them just real real often except i do use my gas i keep track of my gas on my credit cards
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because that either you're not financed charged on there and you don't and you don't um you don't need to have cash there and they don't now you can get it at you know cash is the same price as credit
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so are you married
 	
 	
 		yes we are i am and uh we've got some children and uh
 		you know we've just seen the need for well we just moved into a house uh that we're renting and that's gonna
 	
 	
 		which will suck up your money real quick
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it really will so we're you know we're going to have to really take a hard look at our uh expenses and things like that and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know really make the dollars uh go a little bit further if we can and we uh had not been paying very much for housing uh since we moved to Dallas in July
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh you know we'd go out to eat on Sunday after church or something like that and i think we're gonna have to kind of watch what we do now because that can add up with five kids
