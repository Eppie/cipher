 		i'm Bridget
 	
 	
 		i'm Paul
 	
 	
 		nice to meet you
 	
 	
 		pleased to meet you
 	
 	
 		where are you
 	
 	
 		i'm in Texas
 	
 	
 		are you so am i where are you in Texas
 	
 	
 		Dallas
 	
 	
 		okay i'm in Lubbock
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		okay are you ready for me to push one
 	
 	
 		sure anytime
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 		so what do you think about capital punishment
 	
 	
 		well i think it's a necessary uh
 		a necessary tool that uh needs to be used uh to establish justice in some cases and to that that it if used properly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i think it can be uh it would it would be a useful deterrent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		what do you think about Jeffrey Dahmer
 		like not getting since they don't have it in
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think that
 		i think there are certain
 		people in society that have no redeeming
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh worth to them and that it's it it's a waste for society to continue to support those people those people should be
 		you know disposed of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know because it's like it's kind of like a tough call because all they do is sit in jail and the jails are overcrowded you know it's like problem upon problem upon problem
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		it's like you could put them in jail for the rest of his life well all the jails are already overcrowded
 		you know and they add more problems
 		you know since jails are overcrowded they have to reduce you know
 		time to like one third of what you're supposed to do it you know it gets kind of ridiculous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right i mean they probably you know we
 		the you know our our justice system is not designed to be either efficient or effective or just you know it it's designed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as a set of artificial rules that you know judges and lawyers play with each other
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i know i i guess i could be for it and against it in some ways i mean
 		i think i'm definitely for it and stuff when i think of someone like like him that killed all those people and has
 		no remorse or anything you know i feel like that's the right thing to do and i guess i would have to say it would be for more circumstances you know
 	
 	
 		well it it it uh yeah but it you know the the problem is
 		it when when we administer it
 		by you know i i mean like like in Texas we have the death penalty right and they killed a guy a while back and you know he'd been in jail for twelve or fifteen years or something like that waiting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know waiting waiting waiting waiting his sentence
 	
 	
 		yeah see i think that   what is the point of that
 	
 	
 		what what
 		there there's no point in it i mean
 	
 	
 		where did that come from
 	
 	
 		well it it's because it's because
 		you know people don't wanna recognize
 		how to make you know how to how to make a punishment effective
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean it
 		punishing the person by killing them doesn't do anybody any good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the only reason the only way it does some good is if it convinces convinces somebody else that they shouldn't do something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true definitely true
 	
 	
 		and you know if the guy waits around ten or twenty years or whatever it is you know how is that a deterrent to anybody
 	
 	
 		see why do you have any clue why that they sit on like death row that long
 	
 	
 		because the courts require it
 		i mean they they they have said that well everybody has to have certain you know has to have the the the right to appeal well
 	
 	
 		see
 		yeah i understand that
 	
 	
 		but not only do they have the right to appeal they must appeal and you know they the the lawyers go in there and they generate
 	
 	
 		it takes prolong it forever
 	
 	
 		well they generate all kinds of possible reasons that they might be able to appeal uh you know they they're they're trying to generate
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		technicalities you know things which aren't really related to whether the guy did it or not but as to whether something in the process was right or wrong
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah the the
 		yeah
 		see
 	
 	
 		and you know it it it doesn't work you know our whole justice system doesn't work like that
 	
 	
 		yeah it'd be easier if at least if someone was
 		you know sentenced to death then if they were to have to have an appeal it should be taken care of as quickly as possible you know
 	
 	
 		yes that's right
 	
 	
 		and i understand appeals take a long time and everything else but you know
 		i mean they should have like
 		God there's something so it'd be done faster you know because then they complain about the jails and the
 		this and that and this and that and people sitting on death row for like fifteen years well that's dumb
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 		it is it's terrible
 	
 	
 		mean mean at least if you're going to do it do it like because i mean that's like even torture kind of you know
 	
 	
 		oh i again i i don't feel sorry for the for the for the victim that that's on you know for the for the criminal
 	
 	
 		yeah
