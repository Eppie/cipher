 		so what'd you do with them did you i mean of course you were paid to uh to spend time with them and stuff but what did you do to uh entertain them and keep them entertained were they older kids or school age
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		they were
 		they were seven and nine years old both boys so we played we we did stuff like play softball and frisbee and that kind of thing and
