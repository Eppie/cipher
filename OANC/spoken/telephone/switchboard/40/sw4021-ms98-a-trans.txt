 		but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i got a i just finished a project one of those um swinging cradles
 	
 	
 		uh-huh

 		i'll bet
 		was it hard woods you were using in it
 	
 	
 		yeah oak
 	
 	
 		uh-huh

 		it's just not for me i like it as a hobby more
 	
 	
 		it it's tough uh tough to make a living isn't it
 	
 	
 		boy it sure is i just enjoy making gifts and
 		doing small stuff on the side
 	
 	
 		do you sell any so you do do some sales when you
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah once in a while i'll sell some um custom custom type wood work if they're willing to pay the price now
 		i used to get ripped off all the time because i spent way too much time on them
 	
 	
 		um  do you do cabinets too
 	
 	
 		um i'm starting to i used that's what i did for a job one summer i made some cabinets for a junior high school and but i haven't done a lot of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is it hard wood when you use when you what kind of hard wood do you use
 	
 	
 		i use oak face frames and then just plywood for the box
 	
 	
 		that plywood that's got the oak uh do you use that a lot where it's just you know what maybe a quarter inch or even thinner than that possibly piece of oak that's on the outside do you use that a lot
 	
 	
 		the yeah the just on the outside where it shows yeah just slip it into a groove that you make on the face frame
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then you can just slip that in there it's a lot cheaper of course quarter inch and three quarter inch aren't much cheaper than each other
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		of plywood
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		and then they just have an oak face on them
 	
 	
 		yeah just a
 	
 	
 		are they ready to uh
 		i guess finish or do you have to do anything
 	
 	
 		for to the plywood yeah i just finish sand it just like with one fifty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then you can finish it up
 		so
 	
 	
 		do you have a workshop or are you using the garage or
 	
 	
 		um just the garage i wish i had a workshop but the stuff i do i i don't need a lot of room for it
 	
 	
 		and your wife puts up with that
 	
 	
 		uh she puts up with me buying the tools  she likes wood she likes me wood working but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh huh
 	
 	
 		getting the equipment i want sure is taken a lot of years i started when i was about sixteen buying my own equipment
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i only need a few more things like a joiner i'd like to have and small some smaller things
 	
 	
 		expensive you can get a lot of money in that kind of stuff especially the good stuff
 	
 	
 		oh man everytime we
 		yeah i just bought a a sprayer to finish my project um a high volume low pressure sprayer
 	
 	
 		air uh air uh air pressure
 	
 	
 		it's a high volume low pressure they're new sprayers that are coming out
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		really little over spray
 	
 	
 		is is is it electric or air
 	
 	
 		it's air it only sprays with three PSI
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but uh the cubic feet per minute of air flow is up to ninety and so that's what
 		that's what gives you your thrust of your paint
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um do you do
 	
 	
 		how much how much does that cost you
 	
 	
 		it was five hundred bucks
 	
 	
 		is that right gee and that was just for the gun that wasn't for the compressor anything
