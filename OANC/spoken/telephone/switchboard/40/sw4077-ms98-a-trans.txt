 
     		
 	
 		how do you feel about gun control
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh
 		i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but it's going to a lot of the stuff that i mean all you do is to get guns
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i don't really know i mean unless they do uh just outlaw them how you can uh i mean prevent that
 	
 	
 		well don't you think that you know just having you know some
 		you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know
 		you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry
 	
 	
 		yeah that well do you even know what the procedures are now
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		it varies from State to State
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		there is no national
 	
 	
 		but it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it
 	
 	
 		uh in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know or on probation or  you know
 		other obvious things like that
 		uh and i know i know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before
 		you know be be obviously insane and then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun
 	
 	
 		huh i didn't know that well that's pretty scary
 		so does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh yes i'd probably i'd probably say about a five
 	
 	
 		that's where i would probably be
 	
 	
 		
 
 		seems like it's a good safe number to pick you know
 	
 	
 		well i mean i mean i don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because i mean i do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff and i can understand them wanting to have them but then again it's just like all those nuts out there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh  well you know uh uh other than that if you are looking at like
 		you know country that you know uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much
 	
 	
 		it has
 		because
 	
 	
 		well i mean yeah the uh the in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you know i mean the problem though is you know they if the since the United States had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long
 		that i think you know if you were introduced
 		you know any controls
 		it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so it's so it's really into a kind of a complex problem
 	
 	
 		well is the crime that bad there in Atlanta
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i'm not really sure how bad it is i've i've not really had that many problems with it but i mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up
 	
 	
 		yeah i know Dallas is
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i mean i think you know in the  i mean i i think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years
 	
 	
 		i don't know if Dallas is in the top three but oh do you own a gun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no i've i've thought about getting one if i get one i think i will probably you know get something
 		i probably wouldn't get a hand gun i would probably get like a shotgun just for protecting myself
 		you know from you know burglar type thing i do kind of live in the downtown area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and shotguns are really good because you know they're
 		i mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh and you know you
 		yeah i just don't i just don't understand these people you know that like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know
 		they are probably going to miss the person and they're going shoot and they're going to shoot through five wall and hit someone you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean a shotgun just just struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you pretty much you pretty much stop them and you don't then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much
 	
 	
 		well
 		well now when i first moved to Dallas i moved up here by myself and uh my dad gave me a gun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i finally ended up giving it back to him i said i don't want it i don't want to be responsible for it because
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn i don't need it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that that really does scare me people you know that have guns because you know
 		if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that that person rushes you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and they get it from you uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know you're pretty much dead you know because you you've just told the person that you you're about to kill them then
 	
 	
 		set them off
 	
 	
 		you know and and well i mean
 		you you you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that  you are a real danger to them and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know
 		stop you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's why i ended up giving it back to him i thought well you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't want it if i don't know how to operate you know if i don't really know how to use it and i just didn't want the responsibility
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		so
 		well well uh
 		did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah the did it happen at a cafeteria or something
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		that kind of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns
 		i would be scared selling guns to people
