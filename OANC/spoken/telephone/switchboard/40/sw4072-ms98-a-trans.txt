 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay how do you keep up with current events
 	
 	
 		um well actually usually um  in the mornings i am getting ready to either go to work um usually catch the news in the morning
 	
 	
 		yeah what what channel do you watch or what station
 	
 	
 		uh NBC
 	
 	
 		that's the one i watch i usually keep up with TV
 		i don't i am a student so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		too great sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah i usually tend to just you know rely on you know TV um again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like
 		yeah  what  what today's stories are and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one
 	
 	
 		yeah the radio doesn't really have much
 		news sometimes the stations i listen to are just mainly music
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all
 	
 	
 		yeah do you think that TV is um pretty accurate i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized or
 	
 	
 		well what i really don't like about TV especially local news as compared to like national news is just
 		um it seems it seems like everything is very spoon feed
 		and you know it's
 		it's more like the news shows is now is is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or like the news because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports you know is is you're kids bus driver smoking crack on the way to school you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah also also i have the observation with um
 		with the press is that like any any stories that
 		i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had had
 		more than just a blurb about it that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story
 		it's something wrong
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		going they're looks like they're going more for ratings than for
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know actual news
 		i think you know the
 		probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they
 		typically have a better i am from a small town too here in Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato and
 	
 	
 		yeah the farm report
 	
 	
 		yeah farm report and oil reports
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's pretty pretty sad or who killed who
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah also i have um founded like in
 		newspapers probably aren't as bad as television but i just you know
 		read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well in um in Dallas um i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's
 		and the story was uh
 	
 	
 		was that like  he started shooting people people in this cafeteria or something
 	
 	
 		yeah and the news covered it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		right you know hours after it happened and they were taping people who were crying who
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		had everything and then like three days later this
 		local news station was using as a as their promo
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to promote themselves i just thought that was really
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i have seen that happen lots of times you know
 	
 	
 		that's kind of cold
 	
 	
 		you know Channel X gives you the best coverage  you know we were on the scene with our team players you know
 	
 	
 		yeah and it was just they were showing like these dead people and they were showing people crying i mean just taking advantage of you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it real personal moment
 	
 	
 		they are trying to get the you know most emotional response for
 	
 	
 		yeah it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story but just the play on people's emotions
 		it's just gotten so i mean
 		somewhere there's it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite days you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah i have
 		you know i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um  you know even the national news i just find it to be you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		very watered down very
 	
 	
 		yeah what did you think of the coverage of the war
 	
 	
 		um
 		i found i found it very one sided
 	
 	
 		did you
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know i mean it just it just seemed to lack any sort of debate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um you know you know not saying that we should that we that we definitely should have been there or shouldn't have been there but it just seemed like you know
 	
 	
 		they kept just showing you know how great we were doing and it never really showed what actually
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the damage that really happened that's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the you know the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties and they kind of you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		got really hurt and everything and
 	
 	
 		yeah and i really think that you know in the in the involvement that
 		the press states you know that the the military basically sets the press
