 		i'm Bridgette
 	
 	
 		Michael here
 	
 	
 		nice to meet you
 	
 	
 		nice to meet you where are you
 	
 	
 		i'm in Lubbock Texas
 	
 	
 		Lubbock i'm in Biloxi Mississippi
 	
 	
 		oh really oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		yeah  not too far away
 	
 	
 		i know well are you ready for me to push one okay
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay so what kind of cars do you like
 	
 	
 		well um i i like i don't like real big cars i like fairly sporty smaller cars and uh i have a Toyota Celica right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um it uh the the question they asked us was what would we buy next that's sort of what i have in mind for the next car that i buy is another Celica
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		what year is it
 	
 	
 		it's an eighty seven
 	
 	
 		okay is it because that's what i have too
 	
 	
 		oh you have a Celica oh really what what year is yours
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i love it  i have a eighty nine
 	
 	
 		eighty nine yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a Celica convertible and i love it  Toyota makes great cars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh i do too
 		i do too yeah i think so too that's is the second Toyota that i've had
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and um  we've had it since it's new and uh that's what i i plan on getting another one you know whenever the time comes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you
 		yeah my fiance and i we've talked about it even and he has a um
 		a BMW and they are so  expensive to just keep up and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		
 
 		oh yeah yeah i know
 	
 	
 		that we were both like you know if we're gonna get a new car it'd probably i would say it would be a Toyota too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		for sure
 	
 	
 		what i would really like would be a uh Supra but just can't just can't afford that that's just a little out out of my range
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i know
 		those are nice  i think the next car that we'll look into will be more of a  i don't know i think is it Toyota 4-Runner
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		um i've heard of it i'm not sure what it's it is
 	
 	
 		is that what they're called something like like a or like a um
 		what are they called the one that  the one that Ford makes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		the new ones do you know what i'm talking about
 	
 	
 		so a sort of sporty car
 	
 	
 		no they're kind of more like a truck like a Bronco
 	
 	
 		oh okay um  oh other than the Bronco i'm not sure i don't know what it is uh they have a new one other than the Bronco you're talking about huh
 	
 	
 		type of
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no i don't know what it is i haven't even really looked at the vehicles much lately
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't either
 		but i i would think it would most likely be Toyota
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i think i probably will too because i've had good luck with it never had hardly any problems
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah me neither
 	
 	
 		you know and the one i had before was the same way
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah we had a  a uh Tercel before this an eight two Tercel
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that thing never gave us any problems
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		we had a wreck with it and uh  the only problems we had was because of the wreck you know front end alignment problems and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um uh i will i will say this uh the the Celica that i own now i have replaced the clutch in it
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and that was last year but um i think so i think you just wear them out because we live you know our area's fairly congested and a lot of traffic so it's
 	
 	
 		but that's understandable
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know we use the clutch a lot  i do you're stopping and going a lot you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh i would definitely have to say Toyota though that's the best car i've had
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah and uh i don't i'm i'm you know i don't worry about getting a Japanese car you know everybody's talking about buying American and everything and
 	
 	
 		it's the best built
 		yeah i know
 	
 	
 		uh i just like the Japanese cars i think i think they're better made
 	
 	
 		i know uh i feel like
 		i know i do too i feel like if if like Ford or someone could make one that competed with you know i would buy it i would
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 		yeah if they could make one as cheap you know too i i got i think the American cars they have the Japanese beat when it comes to big cars of course
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh when it comes to little uh sporty cars or that that kind of a car i i don't think there there's any competition really i think the Japanese have them beat
 	
 	
 		yeah i think there's so much more economicable too just like with gas and everything i mean i can go forever on a tank of gas
 	
 	
 		oh yeah sure i do too
 		um-hum
 		well i can too i'm um
 	
 	
 		it's like
 	
 	
 		i fill up maybe well i fill up about once every week and a half i'd guess i'd say
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and uh i do a lot of driving right now i'm in school and everything so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um been doing a lot of extra driving but it's you know it's not bad not at all
 	
 	
 		go a far way on that tank of gas  i know
 	
 	
 		well
 		that's right that's right
 		well uh is yours the Celica that you have is it a um  an ST or a GT or what
 	
 	
 		it's a GT
 	
 	
 		GT mine is an ST
 	
 	
 		what is that
 	
 	
 		uh it's little lower model than the GT
 	
 	
 		is it
 	
 	
 		yeah they had the ST the GT and the GTS you know and the the ST is the uh cheaper  version of all three of them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		really my mom has a a GTS
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she has a eighty nine GTS Celica
 	
 	
 		yeah that's got a little  little power more powerful engine and a lot more uh little more options on it so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah she i know she has this big powerful engine on she doesn't drive i mean she doesn't drive over forty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah well that's the way mothers are
 	
 	
 		i know and the fu nny thing is because she bought it and i don't think the guy really i don't think she realized everything with the insurance and stuff on
