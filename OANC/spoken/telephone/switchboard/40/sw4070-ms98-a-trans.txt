 
     		
 	
 		well i definitely think taxes are too high
 		uh taxes at all levels uh state local and federal are over fifty percent of many people's uh income now
 		and uh the amazing thing is to think that one of the primary reasons for the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution was exorbitant taxes
 		but for them exorbitant taxes were under ten percent it was ridiculous you know uh that that uh we we took such drastic action over taxes
 		uh and it's so much worse now but people are just apathetic about it and sit back and do nothing
 	
 	
 		well let's see uh yeah i think taxes are high but uh
 		yeah maybe in some cases they're not high enough for instance uh
 		here in my state uh
 	
 	
 		you have a real high sales tax there if i recall
 	
 	
 		yeah we do yeah but the but the reason the sales tax is high is because we don't have an income tax
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know we don't have an income tax because uh basically nobody nobody wants any new taxes but the upshot is that we can't properly fund uh education here
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah so like the amount that we spend on education here in uh in the state of Washington per uh per student
 	
 	
 		get out of my room
 	
 	
 		is is actually in the in the lower percentile uh i mean is is is low it we're we're ranked fairly low
 	
 	
 		interesting
 	
 	
 		uh per fifty states yet uh you know yet we expect a lot out of the schools you know we've got here in the Seattle area we've got a lot of uh
 		uh high technology industries we've got Microsoft here well Microsoft expects well educated employees
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but uh you know Microsoft is only paying property taxes towards uh
 		towards uh towards schools so and there are those that argue well they waste too much money in schools or those or there there's
 		you know more money doesn't solve the problem but i feel like in public schools that they uh
 		uh that they really don't fund it they they don't basically fund it very well
 	
 	
 		my my feeling about at least i I don't know if we want to get off the subject of taxes and on to the subject of schools but around here
 		uh some of the public schools get more funds than
 		the private schools uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure at say Carver High School in Atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student
 		but the best private school
 		is uh has a tuition of only seven thousand and all of their students of course rank consistently in the top ten percent on the SAT etcetera and the the public school that gets uh quite a bit more money
 		just doesn't uh doesn't turn out that quality of student and
 	
 	
 		well it's cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah but i think a lot of it is just that uh the money is wasted on bureaucracy and it's not very efficient um
 		uh we we have you know a state department of education and things which
 		all all they do is do statistics and push paper around and none of the uh one of the things that's happened here is that uh the percentage of the money going to instruction
 		meaning teacher's salaries and books and materials has been falling even though that the uh total funding has been going up
 		uh so that uh you know whereas twenty years ago seventy percent of the money going to schools
 		went to teacher's salaries and books and materials now it's only forty five percent and that's really scary to think that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's i've i've been hearing that that's uh that that's been going down and uh i don't know what uh what all the reasons are for that
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh
 		on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know we're spending
 		a couple a hundred billion dollars a year to maintain troops in Europe and Asia uh we have no business spending that money
 		and uh we're spending over two hundred billion dollars a year on interest on the debt uh there was a Presidential candidate forum here
 		last Saturday and just we just had our primary in Georgia and uh
 		uh you know i I one of the questions i asked the representative of Bob Carey who was there was uh
 		and we have a projected four hundred billion dollar budget deficit this year
 		what are you gonna do to to correct that and all he talked and and all they could say all the is the only thing he would do is consolidate some cabinet
