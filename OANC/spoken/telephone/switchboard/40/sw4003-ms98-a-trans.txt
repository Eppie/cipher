 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um have you had any experience in trying to find child care
 	
 	
 		um yes some what um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we do baby sitting here like
 		my neighbor and i share baby sitting and um then i ran a preschool so i know you know from the other end you know trying to help people find
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		really
 	
 	
 		find day care so yeah
 	
 	
 		okay well i've done more or less the same we have five children and um
 	
 	
 		so what about you
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		uh yeah  i just haven't found it equitable to work outside the home and so i have done the day care inside my home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		how has that worked out
 	
 	
 		well i've done it for seven years and uh it's pretty well driven me crazy
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 		yeah i can imagine i've got three kids and i think i mean
 		it's sometimes it's easier like last week my husband was gone and i had  my three nieces and nephews over and it was really much more calm than than than having just my three at home
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh was it oh
 		uh-huh that's true sometimes sometimes they do offer a just a play time for your kids
 	
 	
 		but yeah
 		yeah it it depends though it depends on how well behaved the other kids are yeah we have some times its like oh if i can only get these kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		hum
 	
 	
 		um  hang hang on just a second  um
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay just a second i'm on the phone  yeah i've got three preschoolers um but uh
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i i think it's we've wanted to do i've wanted to join a baby sitting co-op
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um that's we there're several of them around here um
 		the one my my sister in law is in you have to be recommended in to
 		the co-op you know that way some one knows you and you and you just aren't giving your kids out to any body and i just haven't found one that's close enough to me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that i feel comfortable with at this point um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but because i mean you don't wanna you don't wanna leave with your kids with anybody and um
 	
 	
 		no no you don't
 	
 	
 		the day care centers around here i i really my kids go to preschool and i have found some really good ones um
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		one of them goes two days a week and the other one goes one day a week and that's a nice break and  it's this is a
 	
 	
 		oh how fun
 	
 	
 		i really like the one that that they're in um they've got some really qualified teachers there they've been there for a long long time they've got um a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		certified kindergarten teacher doing the curriculum for the older you know the fours and the three year olds and stuff so that's that is really good i really like that
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		that would be fun yeah that's good for the kids and then it's fun for you too to have that little break during the week
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i like that i i like that little break oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh now on that co-op um do women just trade baby sitting or
 	
 	
 		you you you start out with like coupons and um i don't  i think i think you start out like with say twenty or thirty and and you have to um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		when when you baby sit somebody they pay you in coupons and then um
 		they uh then you pay the other people in coupons and i think some of them is in like thirty minute time slots or in hour time slots and you have to do it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum oh gosh
 	
 	
 		you know per child um at least the the ones that i've seen that have worked and then they normally get together like once a month and um
 		to you know decide you know how many do you have and and then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they say okay you need to you know if if you're taking in a lot of baby sitting
 		and you're not you know doling it out also then um
 		a lot of times they'll say okay you need to you know you need to let people sit for you um that way it'll even out you some people aren't getting you know without they don't have any more coupons left
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh what my goodness
 	
 	
 		and um their monthly meetings the one i went to one and they a lot of times they'll have um special people come and talk about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh say safety or you know different things with about children and some times they'll just have get togethers you know even even with the kids like during the day and stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it gets them helps them to know one another and then you know its can be pretty informative also
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well that sounds like a terrific idea my goodness i haven't heard of anything like that out here in Utah and it sounds like that'd be something good to start huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah i that's i don't know all the um i don't know all the details uh um i i i don't know if
 		it seems like it seems like her the my sister in law's um uh they are in
