 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think that uh one uh advantage
 		of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted um
 	
 	
 		definitely
 	
 	
 		and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that i guess uh maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who
 		is very unreasonable in some way that uh
 		you uh would have a problem
 		uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		have you ever served on a jury before
 	
 	
 		uh i have twice
 		it was pretty wild experience
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh what sorts of cases were they
 	
 	
 		they were just you know small town cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know
 	
 	
 		so were they criminal or civil
 	
 	
 		they were civil they weren't they weren't any criminal
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		what uh what was the verdict did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision
 	
 	
 		uh the jury it was uh let me see i think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it was they and uh the one changed his vote
 		at the end
 	
 	
 		so did it become
 	
 	
 		so it became unanimous you know after they turned it in and then he changed his mind after they turned it in but it then became unanimous so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		ah
 		
  
 		oh
 		but since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right you just needed a majority
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		what was what was the other case that was also civil
 	
 	
 		the the uh other case was just traffic
 		the and you know it was seat belt law and it it didn't even hardly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh didn't really even count
 	
 	
 		go through so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm a college student so i haven't been you know of a jury eligible age for very long um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i did get um one summons actually at one point but i
 		declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was uh a very bad time
 	
 	
 		yeah well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do it at some point um but uh i i haven't
 		um one one thing that i i think is um
 		you know maybe is a problem is uh i i i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		uh especially sort of
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't think that it does
 	
 	
 		ow well
 	
 	
 		i mean from from my experience from what i experienced in them it didn't you know it didn't
 	
 	
 		the
 	
 	
 		didn't turn out the as the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go it
 	
 	
 		ah but you thought it turned out pretty well
 	
 	
 		yeah but it was you know it was jury was unorganized and
 		it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not used to it not being organized and i just assumed assumed that it would have been
 	
 	
 		oh so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on
 	
 	
 		that's
 		that's about what it was
 	
 	
 		hum that's interesting did it did it work out pretty well in the end i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial or
 	
 	
 		yeah they well they picked the one person and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it
 		turn out the way it should have so
 	
 	
 		so it worked it did end up working out pretty well
 	
 	
 		yeah it ended up working all right
 	
 	
 		the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh
 		whether especially sort of in uh maybe like product product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract it's sort of a matter of
 		uh you know sometimes getting into very technical issues and i wonder if uh if there's really um
 		if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion
 	
 	
 		uh i don't think that they they they educate them enough to
 		to really know what's going on
 	
 	
 		in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a a bank matter of some kind so
 	
 	
 		yeah  the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that which was assumingly their property it was on his property
 	
 	
 		ah
 		oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it and he hadn't made the payments
 	
 	
 		right
 		so they came to get it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then when they came to get it well it it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them take it off
 	
 	
 		ah so they were suing to get it back
 	
 	
 		so and they'd already it was a double wide so they'd already taken it apart
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		so they left it there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then when
 		they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so they were suing him for the money and
 		you know there's no way they could because it's
 		it was the moving company
