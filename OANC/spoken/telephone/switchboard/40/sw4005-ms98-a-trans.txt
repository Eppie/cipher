 
     		
 	
 		well what do you think about how we've changed in the last ten twenty years
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think it's pretty amazing i think um that my grandparents especially have seen a whole lot of change in their lives but um
 	
 	
 		in in like in what ways particularly are you thinking
 	
 	
 		well technology but also morals morals and things like that i think even even in the last like four years you can still see things falling so fast and that can be
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for me that's the biggest change it's so frustrating um to see everything
 		
 
 	
 	
 		disintegrating
 	
 	
 		disintegrating and losing control your your losing control it seems like of the moral fiber of our society
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems that well it its a seems like it's definitely a transitional time i'm not sure
 		exactly what's happening there're good things that have happened but but at the moment we're suffering from
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think information overload for one thing um just just the technology like you mentioned
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		faxes and car phones and VCRs and all of that that make us so immediate there there's no time for
 		relationships talking sitting being with each other all of that
 	
 	
 		i think you're really right i think like well even with computers um
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		you can there i mean there's so much that's happening in in that field and it
 		it just has forced us to go so fast and
 		um even the way we write it used to be if you read a book like you know Thomas Hardy takes two chapters to establish the mood and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and just describes the scenery and what's been going on and stuff and now we just chopped all that out and say well let's get to the point and
 	
 	
 		exactly no patience
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no attention span
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		these sound bites you're exactly right i mean all there's all that and then we've got the rich getting richer and everyone else getting poorer
 		with with you know with with little hope of of having any impact i think impotence is a
 		is a a word that that suits most of America now we don't feel like we can influence you know influence anything
 	
 	
 		yeah you feel out of control
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh like just a few people have it all wrapped up and they're not going to let you through um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's a bad feeling
 	
 	
 		yeah it is it's really frustrating and the way our families you know our nuclear families are
 		disintegrating and stuff it's just a real
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you don't have the the social networks we used to have to
 	
 	
 		yeah go ahead
 	
 	
 		to protect the family and protect the people in the family and things like that with everyone moving
 		you know every five years you lose your contacts you lose trusted friends that you know they'll do things you know in America it seems now it's independence is the thing and
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know heaven forbid if you ask anyone for anything
 	
 	
 		yeah then that's
 	
 	
 		whereas we used to be able to depend on each other and trust each other and
 		you'll help me and i'll help you not and not in this corrupted sense but in the sense of
 		you know when you're in trouble and you need someone you know someone to babysit the kids sure
 	
 	
 		um-hum the interdependence interdependence in a nice way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah i think uh i i don't know there was a lot there was good and bad in the nuclear family we've certainly found out a lot about the bad about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but but but the community
 		however the family looked and it didn't always look like a nuclear family even then you know you had generations living together or you know whatever community has just definitely been lost and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think a lot of people are trying to reestablish it in all sorts of different ways um you know well okay so we don't have a small town and okay so we move but
 		you know maybe there's some way that we can have a group that works together you know everything from people who do live in communal you know almost commune areas that they've started up again you know
 		um special cities or little towns that do that to people who do it through a church or through a book club or something i mean something you know  even offices have started sort of becoming the community
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think i think because it's a necessity
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as as as human beings we need a network around us of people we can rely on i guess that's uh thing is that right now it's such a um
 	
 	
 		um-hum and yeah
 	
 	
 		temporary thing that how far does it go how far can you depend on them and they're so much more fragile at the touch you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and that's a good point and and we don't have the intergenerational generational
 		community either which means that do you do you have to be between twenty and forty to be accepted and if
