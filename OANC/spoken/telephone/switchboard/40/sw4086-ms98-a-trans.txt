 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um what do you think
 	
 	
 		well it depends on whether i have to buy my next car before or after my children are out of the house
 	
 	
 		well that makes a big difference doesn't it
 	
 	
 		we've we've gone from small cars and sports cars to station wagons and a van a mini van
 	
 	
 		it's kind of like well if
 		right a little more domestic there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i guess the biggest factor for me lately is American versus non American and while i'd really like to buy American
 		i don't know it just it really depends on reliability for me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i have a Ford right now and it's been a pretty good truck
 		but some of the things are not that good about it and Ford sales have been really bad in terms of customer uh customer service at least for me
 		so it's i don't know it's it's kind of disappointing
 	
 	
 		well well when we  i guess this is talking about previous cars opposed to to next car but when we went to look for a mini van i wanted to get you know i thought it'd be nice to buy American and i went and looked at all the American ones
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the doors didn't close right and the i mean and this is on the lot and you're thinking to yourself if it's not right now what is it gonna be like after i've had it for six months
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well one of the good i guess one of the good things that i have to work on is my my father he's a pharmaceutical rep and he he gets a new car about once every three years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he's been driving a lot of mini vans in the last like five or ten years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh he generally goes with i think the Astro Van
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um it's the only one that has a standard six cylinder which is real important to him but
 		i don't know i guess i guess for my next car i'd probably have to probably have to scale down to an actual car instead of a pick up starting to get into that i'm a college student right now i'm a doctoral student
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i anticipate getting a full time job soon so  you know probably one of those things where i really don't need the the hauling capacity much i'll be a little more stable but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i guess i don't know i'm i i think i'll probably buy American but i'm just not real sure you know
 	
 	
 		you have to go out of here go talk to dad
 		yeah
 		well um
 		i know i've i've always looked for mileage
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know cause i figure the the better miles it gets the better but the less pollutants it's putting out cause the better job it's doing burning stuff up
 	
 	
 		sure and i
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and that opens up a whole another can of worms i guess Ford is suppose to start out with they're gonna actually put out a line of electric cars next year in California
 	
 	
 		yeah doesn't that sound neat if you were gonna if you if you could afford two cars and you were going to do a lot of city driving
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah
 		um-hum oh that'd be a definite yeah that'd be the way to go for sure i think there's no questions in in in terms of whether i would have that or not i
 	
 	
 		go away from here
 	
 	
 		sounds like your kids want to get on the conversation
 	
 	
 		just a minute
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		David remove Jeffrey from my presence i'm on the telephone
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i bet they'd have something to say about buying cars huh
 	
 	
 		well my my kids oh my kids think it's great we've  unfortunately our convertibles have been retired for lack lack of time on our part to um
 		to work on them but we have a Fiat an old Fiat and an old MGB
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		sitting in behind our house and the kids are convinced the older two kids are convinced that that's going to be their cars
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Jeffrey hasn't figured out yet just you know it's like who want oh Jeffrey's only three you know and the but the other ones aren't very old either
 	
 	
 		how old are they
 		oh i see
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's like who's going to inherit you know Jeffrey's like well you know station wagon a mini van you know you got to go get another old convertible my husband well my husband would love to buy next is a Miata
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know is the Mazda Miata
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard some good things about that car actually
 	
 	
 		it's suppposed to be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really solid car we have a a Mazda right now
 	
 	
 		yeah a big factor for me is is ergonomics and and in terms of control and display design that's that's what i'm going into for my degree
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh neat
 	
 	
 		and so that's that's something i really try to consider a little more heavily heavily than most people probably do but
 	
 	
 		well it they have something that
 		you know i there's some things i like better about my Subaru and some things i like better about the Mazda and uh you know and i'm always looking at that kind of thing at other people's cars and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it it
 	
 	
 		it's amazing how much spot light it's gotten lately you know it seems like everyone that's a big concern now you know it's
 	
 	
 		well it's not just you know but like i have one car that tells me which door is open and the other one only tells me that a door is open
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so when it only tells me that a door is open i have to get out of the car and go around slamming doors until i mean that's a nuisance that's a real pain
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah um and one of them only has the standard full to empty gauge and the other
