 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what do you think about uh employers screening
 		you know job candidates for drug drug usage
 	
 	
 		well i can kind of see it both ways because um
 		you don't want to get i guess i generally feel against it but i can see why an employer wouldn't want to have employees that are on drugs
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that could cause all kind of problems i'd would like to see it see them be able to not need to screen more than i would like to see them screening
 	
 	
 		right you think it infringes on personal rights to have that type of screening
 	
 	
 		right i think that we ought to be  employer certainly has the right to say on the application are you on drugs or something like that
 		and then if they say well i'm on drugs then they say well we would like rather have somebody that isn't on drugs
 	
 	
 		but a lot of times people who are on drugs don't admit it
 	
 	
 		that's right especially when they're trying to get a job and i guess everybody knows that if they're trying to get a job
 		that
 		if they put down that they're on drugs they're not gonna get it
 	
 	
 		right yeah i don't really have that much a problem with drug screening i think um
 		if it's gonna effect their job performance uh i think it's reasonable for an employer to request a drug test but uh
 	
 	
 		right i guess depends on the job some jobs that depend on which public safety depends like um pilots and air traffic controllers people who drive the trains
 		um things like that but i don't think SEPTA
 		actually  does um routine screening for their workers and that might not be a bad idea i've see a couple that look like they might be on drugs
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah it always should be mandatory for some uh positions such as those but um
 	
 	
 		right
 		but other well i don't know
 		every job
 		right i guess
 		i don't know i'd would
 		obviously an employer doesn't wanna have a person on drugs but if somebody's on drugs and they get into the work place it might be uh a better thing for them than to have them out there on the street mugging people
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true you there has to be that's the that's the key i think is is what happens when you find a person who is on drugs you got to just that's when you have to be careful you know you just can't
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		fire every person something needs to be done to help these kind of these people
 	
 	
 		that's right if they now behind the drug testing was something like that so that it wasn't that a person just didn't get a job that
 	
 	
 		right they can go and
 	
 	
 		if they ever tested uh positive on drugs then they'd if that were the case then they'd be always unemployed
 	
 	
 		right there should be some sort of program they can go into to try to clean themselves up and be given a second chance
 	
 	
 		so
 		well some perhaps a program but
 		i know people go into programs there with other people that have a lot of the same problems and that's in some ways good it lets them feel like they have support
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but on the other side hand it's they need to be around people that have their lives together and aren't on drugs they need to be you know people wouldn't be getting into trouble as much if they
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		especially young people here in Philadelphia
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if they had  if they were so busy during the day that when they went
 		um when they went home at night they were tired and they had to go to sleep
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so
 		but if people are not working and they're just running around loose with nothing to do they got a lot of energy and it gets them into trouble
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		that's true yeah
 		i don't know i'm thinking if from my perspective let's say you owned a business um you would want to have the opportunity to screen any uh candidate for a job within your own company
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if you put yourself in that situation you don't want to hire someone who's on cocaine
 	
 	
 		right are you in business
 	
 	
 		no but i i could it's something i may do eventually so um from that perspective i can i'd see the need for drug testing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right more more or less for large businesses than small businesses i think mostly go on personal contacts and who knows who and what people they know would say about them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so with thinking about my daddy and working down on the farm in South Carolina and hiring people and
 		you know even at fast food restaurants and um
 		field work it's
 		the person doing the hiring and the supervisor going and talking to people and finding out who know what about who
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i guess it's kind of the old boy network maybe that isn't as much so in the larger cities like Philadelphia
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		right yeah you can't really do that you could be hiring someone for uh uh a managerial white collar position in your company and uh the person can appear very
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well qualified and and perfectly normal but uh they may be having a lot more problems
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah they can
