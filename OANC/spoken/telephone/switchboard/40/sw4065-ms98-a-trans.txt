 
     		
 	
 		okay well how do you feel about uh drug testing uh for prospective employees
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i i think my feelings on it are it depends i think if it's necessary if you have the kind of job that it it requires you to always be
 		you know like police officers firemen doctors anybody who has you know who's important whose decisions are important and  you know that's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's what i think as far as you are required to not only be at work when you're not at work
 		as it were you know what i'm saying if you if if
 	
 	
 		oh i see oh twenty four hour people you mean
 	
 	
 		yeah people who who could be at work at any time or whose decisions could be clouded if they had to make a decision
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when they aren't at work but i don't see the point in it if you're
 		if you're putting something together down at the local pizza place or whatever
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then i'd uh i just don't see what merits you're going to have from gaining
 		what you do when you're not at work in those situations is your own business i think i think that's an infringement upon your personal rights
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's an invasion of your personal privacy that's
 		if they were to decide that you shouldn't be drinking would would they just you know i mean you you have to draw the line somewhere i think and give people
 		the right to do what they need to do what they want to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		would you  uh would you
 		do it before they were employed or would would you say random testing is also okay
 	
 	
 		yes i okay i'm i'm i'm i i think that's fine i think if you're if if it matters to you that much then
 		you should you know i mean if you want to weed out those kind of people right from the start i have no problem with that because you don't you don't want somebody who's a drug user starting work for you but i don't i don't think that they can just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		come back and and get you anytime you know i i don't think it it could be surprise at your door here we are you know or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or come to show up for work one day and they just say here you go i i don't know it's kind of
 	
 	
 		it's a hard problem isn't it because because you don't want an airline pilot on drugs
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's it's really you don't
 		
 
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		but at the same time that's a that's a that's an embarrassing humiliating kind of test to have to take people questioning you by you know by doing that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		um-hum it's yeah it's kind of a
 		do you trust me do you not trust me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it's i don't know i don't i don't know it's it's awfully it's it has it's points it's good points and it's bad points see
 		it kind of makes us look like we're going in the other direction as far as the way the rest of the world's going almost
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i've walls are coming come in Berlin and
 	
 	
 		and we're and we're getting
 	
 	
 		we
 		and here we are we're going the other way and
 	
 	
 		it does feel like it doesn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah it does and so i don't know it's kind of a perplexing problem
 	
 	
 		i know
 		well it is because when we think about it and it isn't at all reassuring
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		doctors have been on drugs for years  from what i hear
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and and uh we've uh and we have all sorts of people who've done things and i'm certainly not in favor of of any of that and yet somehow they've performed and then they say well if i did what i was suppose to do and did it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the way i was suppose to do it then why would you you know whose business is it
 	
 	
 		yeah who am i harming as long as i am doing my job yeah
 	
 	
 		right and yet the potential like
 		i don't like knowing that there might be an alcoholic who is flying my plane or or you know cutting into my body
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah exactly you don't want your doctor coming in hung over if he's gonna be cutting on you that day that's for sure so
 		uh yeah that is difficult you're gonna you can't but then that just kind of comes back to personal responsibility
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you but i guess that's  more or less forcing you to be personally responsible for yourself
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's basically all they're trying to do with that then if you want to  if you look at it that way because you would think your doctor wouldn't be out drinking the night before but but if he thought he could get caught doing it then he certainly wouldn't do it as opposed to well
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		it's not a big operation tomorrow what the heck or something  you know
 	
 	
 		it's only only only old lady so and so from where ever and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah it's just a gallbladder it ain't  you know no problem yeah i guess that's just uh that's basically what they're doing then just forcing you to be responsible but i guess some people have to be forced so
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		yeah it and it does it does make you wonder because i'm not sure i was trying to think in in history have have people checked that or did people just
 		did people just
 		accept the responsibility or are we able to test things now that never could be tested before so therefore we're using technology in a way that wasn't available before
 	
 	
 		that was yeah wasn't yeah that's i don't know i i kind of think well it's partially because we have the technology now but it's also because i think moral standards have gone downhill quite a bit since
 		earlier you know i mean it's just it's just reached that point where society accepts
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know you don't think about seeing your doctor out at a bar anymore whereas you know nineteen forty doctor so and so
 	
 	
 		right
