 
     		
 	
 		okay Eric um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you married and do you have a family
 	
 	
 		uh yes i am to uh both questions
 	
 	
 		okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances
 	
 	
 		uh yeah we do we um
 		uh basically there's the you know expenses that
 		are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh what's ever left uh after that we you know we we sit down and agree on kind of what
 		you know what sort of range we're gonna
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		generally gonna shoot for
 	
 	
 		i see
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what do you do
 	
 	
 		well that's basically what we do um about every every three months or so
 		we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then we divvy them up between
 		our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and so that does help that helps a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then um we don't have a lot extra extra for extra spending  so it's pretty well  earmarked
 	
 	
 		yeah all allocated out  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah  every every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and
 		and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we
 		found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all
 	
 	
 		all the
 	
 	
 		um-hum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or
 	
 	
 		checks yeah
 		right yeah we found that um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of
 		the unnecessary expenses  we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were um spending uh
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		money for things that
 		you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		thought it to be really helpful we've gotten some of our loans paid off early
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because of this and and stuff like that so
 	
 	
 		well it helps you to focus
 		where your money goes and and i'm sure you felt the same the same frustration before you got on a budget but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money go where does it go
 	
 	
 		that's a lot of money but
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		huh and also we have found that if we write down
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know
 		every paycheck
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see
 		just what you do spend and and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we should because it does help
 	
 	
 		yeah the other the other thing that that we've found that that helps if
 		you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to uh uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever just put it in a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount
 	
 	
 		
 
 		just stick to that uh-huh that is
 	
 	
 		and then once that was gone well  if the entertainment amount was gone for the month oh it's gone
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		that
 		that sounds like a really good idea
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		and it really helpful
 		um have you  developed a savings plan or IRAs or anything like that yet
 	
 	
 		we we haven't we our our initial goal was just to retire our debt uh completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh credit card debt and and all of that and we're just at a point where where we could start thinking about it so
 	
 	
 		oh that's good that's a good feeling
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		my husband just graduated from the university uh
 		a year ago so finally  finally we are getting to that point too so are you still going to school or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		a study
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm actually in the in the master
