 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'll talk about my city a little bit
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i've noticed that there's actually being uh quite there's been a quite a bit done uh i noticed that uh the uh several of my uh
 		uh grocery stores have been putting up signs that plastic bags and uh trying to recycle the uh gallon uh containers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i i'm beginning to see some uh real positive effects i mean huh although i won't claim that that the that that we're doing everything and it's uh you know i i try to recycle uh papers and cans
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum what about glass they have glass
 	
 	
 		uh i have not seen a whole lot of glass but the same time in this area
 		at least when it comes to like uh Coke and Pepsi uh they don't really hardly use any glass
 	
 	
 		huh so they know um here they have um they have trash sorting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i mean not not right here where i am but in the in the town next door they have um
 		they have trash sorting and you know they put out aluminum and glass and newspaper in separate bins
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh  i guess there's a lot of raiding by homeless people and that kind of thing because they go out and it's like
 		they they pay for this by the by the by the aluminum they collect
 	
 	
 		right right well i i know that uh uh that's that one thing that uh they're not real good about yet is
 		it seems like the paper sorting you still we still are forced pretty much to take everything in you know we don't really have any help from the sanitation department
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so the life is not easy in that way we still have to kind of take care of our own aluminum uh so it's still up to the individual it's it's not really part of any uh a government sponsored programs or anything
 	
 	
 		i see so so um do you actually live in Atlanta
 	
 	
 		uh yeah uh pretty much i i really don't live in the same county as what you'd call Atlanta central but there's several counties that count as Atlanta
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i know the cities are um i think Dekalb
 	
 	
 		you well that's Dekalb actually it's you're right it's spelled that way D D E C A L B but that that's Dekalb
 	
 	
 		Dekalb yeah Dekalb and Fulton
 		i thought it was i thought it was a K i always thought it was a K but um never mind um
 		and uh isn't Fulton what another county that's uh
 	
 	
 		right Fulton and actually also contained in that is Cobb and also contained in that uh to to some extent is Clayton county although it's pretty much uh still in the Atlanta proper
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh but there's no concentrated concept
 		uh on that sense uh we have uh
 	
 	
 		now where's the city the city limits it's kind of odd that a city would actually spread over uh more than one county the city limits would actually fall into more than one county
 	
 	
 		yeah the the the central uh part of the city the downtown area is in Fulton almost exclusively
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but yeah i mean i i most cities tend to stay mostly mostly in in in one county so you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		in fact San Francisco is entirely within the the the limits of San Francisco County in fact San Francisco County and city have the same city limits
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so that's kind of a weird thing but um
 	
 	
 		right
 		anyways i guess i'm trying to figure out what else there is out here i mean oh we do get papers uh we get we get some help with the papers uh our our our uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh trash company does do a a uh uh if if you sort the papers and and put them in a bag they will put them in a separate area into into the uh uh
 		uh garbage garbage truck i guess i don't know exactly how they do it but they do that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's an interesting term because i mean if you if you think about it's the garbage truck well is it really garbage if they're taking it off to be recycled and somebody's willing to pay for it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it pretty well the the i guess it is in in in that sense uh it still is uh i don't i uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		the uh the papers themselves i mean they some how put them off to the side and i don't know exactly how they do it
 		uh but they but they they do indicate that service
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i think that we you know i think they ought to really start pushing it more you know the idea that you were talking about where they they separate each each container
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that that should be more available we should have more containers in all city uh uh and all the grocery stores
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh to help on on that sort of thing that would that would make it a lot easier
 		i know in uh some cities that they actually distribute out they as part of the the service they give you extra containers that you can that you can put things into so you you know you don't have to go out and buy your own garbage cans and things like that
 	
 	
 		huh
 		huh
 		you have a you have a very uh distinctive accent um where're you from originally
 	
 	
 		well i'm actually originally from Dayton Ohio
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		but that's
