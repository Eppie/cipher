 
     		
 	
 		okay um well why don't you go ahead and start because you have more experience it sounds like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i've got two kids one of them 's a year old and one of them 's going on three
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and in California anyways where i'm located my husband's in the Navy it's really hard to find child care around here because most people that are around here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they're either Mexican or Filipino and they don't speak English
 		so it's like my kids pick up really funny words
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they come home and say something to me and i don't understand what they're saying
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's like i mean day care is really expensive it costs like three hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		oh goodness
 	
 	
 		for day care for two kids for a month and when they come home i don't even understand half the stuff they're saying
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh goodness
 		so do they know what they're saying though do they seem to know the words that they're saying
 	
 	
 		um
 		sometimes
 	
 	
 		because they're they're real young
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah because that could be a blessing further down the road but it can also be a problem now
 	
 	
 		like one day he came home and said something and i asked him what he was saying i told him to point to it so i could understand what he was saying and he was talking about the cartoon you know Peter Pan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he said it you know in i i don't even remember i don't i don't even know which one it was it was either Spanish or Filipino i'm not even sure which language it was
 	
 	
 		oh goodness
 	
 	
 		but he knew it was Peter Pan it's just he didn't say Peter Pan
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and so it's kind of hard to understand what they're saying
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't wanna tell him not to say it because there's nothing wrong with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's just  makes it hard to understand
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they'll be because at this age they're real real young and they could pick up any kind of language it it's amazing how easy they can learn
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i've uh i got two children as well my oldest is eight and my youngest is four and i used to teach and when my first one was born i was lucky enough to be able to choose whether i wanted to work or not and
 		even though i had just gotten my Master's degree i chose to stay home just because i worried a lot about child care and really wanted to be able to be that person that raised my children and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like you're feeling the frustration of what they're picking up on that's exactly the worries that i had is that i worried about what kind of things they might be exposed to or pick up on and i was just really
 		paranoid and i guess just decided to be my own child's caregiver and at times i've regretted it just because i miss working with adults and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know speaking regular language more than the the children's you know kind of language
 	
 	
 		yeah and actually having conversations instead of one line sentences
 	
 	
 		right right and as a cartoon once said i would like to have dinner with someone who can cut their own meat and that kind of thing um
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		but now i'm getting up at the at the stage where i will need to go back to work and so i'm looking at this issue and my four year old is just at the point where she'll be starting kindergarten next year which is still only half day so we'll still have to look at that kind of
 		of set up for her so
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband and i made a deal when our second son was born because we had i had to work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there was after our second son was born there wasn't any choice i had to work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we made a deal he's in the Navy and six months out of the year he's gone on a ship
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so for those six months i don't work i stay home with the kids
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but while he's in dock and he's you know on shore duty for six months then i work in the daytime
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we have child care for them it's only six months out of the year but still it
 		it's just it's kind of weird because the quality of day care is different than what i'm used to because i'm i'm originally from Arizona yeah really
 	
 	
 		oh are you so am i yeah what part oh okay i was in the Phoenix uh Mesa area
 	
 	
 		Mayer
 		yeah a little tiny dinky town up by Prescott
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but um it's really strange because
 		i'm used to just going to my next door neighbor and she babysat me and you know when i first had when we first had our first son she babysat him until we moved and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's really different here
 	
 	
 		oh yeah because now you're depending on other people that you don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah moneywise and you don't know them and you're worried you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean i know a lot of people say well it never happens to you it just happens to other people when children disappear but it's still scary when you have to look for day care
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you always have that fear
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i got to find somebody really you know really that i can depend on
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 		and even if you have someone there right at your own house doing that kind of day care you still always have that little worry i'm sure
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		that's that is a problem what kind of criteria do you look for when you are shopping around
 	
 	
 		well i have a notebook and in it i have the top thirty questions  and that may sound kind of strange but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's i'm just kind of paranoid as a mother it's like  i want my child safe
