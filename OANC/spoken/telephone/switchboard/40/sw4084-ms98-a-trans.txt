 
     		
 	
 		so do you have kids in the public school system
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh no i don't i'm a college student actually no kids yet
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  well i've got preschoolers so we have one that is going to be starting kindergarten next year and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know if i'm real comfortable with the public schools at this point but um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		home schooling right now is not an option for us so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and private private schools um i don't know yeah so you have to deal with it what you have but um
 	
 	
 		pretty expensive
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 		i don't know i'm what do you think about the school systems
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i think that there's a lot that could be done to improve them i uh
 		being that i'm in college and stuff you get to college and you see you know it just seems it seems like
 		that we ought to be doing a lot of the things that are that are done in college i guess should be taught a lot earlier in school like in math and science and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i'm a math major and when i was in high school you know i i think i could of handled a lot of the work that i've been doing here in college at a much younger age
 		and i believe that that's the way that it used to be in this country a long time ago and that it probably is in a lot of other countries too because your
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		your math professors or whatever whatever will always go yeah i was doing this stuff back in high school and you're like well  you know then why the heck is it you know my third year in college and i'm just now getting to it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it just seems like that they've
 		the curriculum in the public schools is just too soft or something
 	
 	
 		yeah they're i feel like they're trying to teach a lot of um
 		they're taking the role of the parent and trying to teach a lot of uh of values and doing a lot of baby sitting and and not getting down to what they need to be teaching
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um yeah there's a lot of things that i i wanna teach my kids and i don't want them to mess around with
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know i don't feel like that's their that's their place um one of the things that uh my husband works for uh for a company that
 		well  well he works for Frito-Lay but they had a a guy come in um talking about some of the new IBM
 		um systems that they have coming out and talking about how school systems are just are not transitioning as as rapidly as um
 		as a lot well industry industry right now is is just gonna have to uh you know well in a transition period  with the computers and stuff and um that was real encouraging as i we we went and looked at the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the kindergarten class that my little boy will go into
 		and they have reading to write which is uh they can write stories and and learn to write on computers so at least uh the school district that we're in has you know computers that they begin on and i really feel like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		um they're going to have to use those a lot and and that way a child that my son already know already knows how to read and he will be able to excel at his own pace where the kids that you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that don't have
 		you know that haven't had the he has a real desire to learn and hopefully he will be challenged throughout
 		you know his school life if he's of you know that things are available to him like the computer
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		go off and and teach himself yeah because i know there's a lot of a lot of junk that i learned in school and it's been it's been a number of years since i've been in high school and college and um
 	
 	
 		work at his own pace
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they uh you know some of the stuff i learned it was such a such a waste of time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i come back and
 		i got a degree in uh i got a business degree in college and that's the most useless degree in the world it's like why did they do this to people  and um you have to you know you have to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you really have to work with um what's out there in the environment and use it to your advantage in the schools right now it's just they're just beginning i think to
 		to take advantage of the computers and and of course not all schools are able to do that because of the expense of them but um
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i agree very highly with your point about the the uh public schools have gotten away from the real sort of
 		hard core curriculum and into areas that are more should be dealt with at home or in the Church or somewhere else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		dealing with value judgements and dealing with how you how you interact with the rest of society because i feel that those are really things that that have no place in the school i mean i i see that they're they're trying to
 		uh i don't know what they are trying to do but i really think that the emphasis should be more on on book learning and not
 		on okay you know here's our civics class this is we're going to talk about how people deal with each other in their community and how it's suppose to be and
 		as opposed to just having straight up math reading writing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
