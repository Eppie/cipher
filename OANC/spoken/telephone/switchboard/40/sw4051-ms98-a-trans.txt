 
     		
 	
 		okay you wanna start
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i might as well uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh
 		uh  uh issue uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of freon different types of freons
 		and it uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah now that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago
 	
 	
 		right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know cheap inexpensive and lots of it
 		uh and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh so have they stopped that practice now
 	
 	
 		well  course there's only a a  tremendous number of a refrigerators and freon excuse me refrigerators and freezers
 		both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the the new cars i guess starting with nineteen nineteen ninety three will not have freon twelve in their systems
 		but uh there's you know there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's got me very concerned you know highly concerned that uh
 		
 
 		it's gonna be quite a while before we can uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so we're so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh
 		have us uh as a an unemployed the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because as i say there is a there's a tremendous well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator
 		and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks
 		and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh that's why i stayed in stayed more towards towards uh
 		uh and that's a polluting polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and
 		the those two mixed together with with water and uh  really make a uh make a mess
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 		yeah i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that that's putting out a lot of dark
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		smoke and i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars but that that particular bothers me
 	
 	
 		right
 		well most
 		most of the time when you see bus uh you know the buses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and uh carbon dioxide and water vapor
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh because when you when diesel diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely
 		that you don't have any uh uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine
 		because diesel oil is uh
 		is not very volatile
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily
 		and it's got uh you know it's it's latent heat is high but it's slow burning at at uh
 		normal pressures that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so if it the car sucks in uh fifty degrees
