 		yeah we do have the death penalty here it's not exercised very often  but we do have it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh personally i'm in favor of capital punishment i know there's a lot of lot of problems with it but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just uh i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten late years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh i i tend to agree with you uh  i've changed my views over uh even even within the last few years uh to be honest  uh
 		
 
 		uh when i was in college when i was an undergraduate i was a member of Amnesty International
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh of course at that time you know i thought uh how it's it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but  the uh
 		the more now i live in  downtown Dallas and i uh  you know i've seen uh i've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think that  maybe a
 		a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder
 	
 	
 		that's a that's a thought that i had never really had on that which which seems pretty sensible
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i
 		yeah it seems sensible and and fail-safe i uh i i don't you know not completely fail-safe but if a man's convicted of two murders uh you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 		i also  uh to tell you how liberal i have turned uh toward this or or or whatever side that is i've kind of chosen uh i believe that that uh
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		big time drug importers like uh say Noriega for example these these people need to be uh eliminated uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh
 		uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh
 		create another power structure
 	
 	
 		yeah you're you're right there uh
 	
 	
 		you know the
 	
 	
 		i just basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me i'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i i'm all in favor of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		uh
 		
 
 		do you uh are there cases where you think that that uh the capital  capital punishment shouldn't be uh uh sentenced
 	
 	
 		well i i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the Jeffrey Dahlmer case i mean i i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and in that case Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then you're kind of playing God  which is never never a good thing to do but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld
 	
 	
 		that's true yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh not really that i can think of i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't really agree with the uh death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that i think that they're
 		they're operating on a more i mean i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but i don't really think that that it's
 		it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because they're feeding our consumer needs
 	
 	
 		right
 		sure yeah i understand i understand your point
 		yeah uh of course you know with uh with with Dahlmer now uh you you realize that Ohio i think it's Ohio uh gets to try him next and they do have the death penalty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		so uh that was a curious case i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that is very curious
 	
 	
 		uh uh that was something is sort of nightmarish to say the least
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's that's right
 	
 	
 		uh well here in Texas we uh i think even even this last week
 		uh last week they had another they uh you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh
