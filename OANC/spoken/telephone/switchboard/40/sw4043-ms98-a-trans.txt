 
		
 			
 				well what kind of music do you like to listen to
 			
 			
 				
 				i'm pretty diverse actually um i consider myself both a performer and also an enjoyer so i kind of get into all all types i run the gamut from uh
 			
 			
 				are you
 			
 			
 				alternative to uh to rock and roll to heavy metal to you name it so i'm pretty open on that
 			
 			
 				oh you like country western
 			
 			
 				country's not bad i can i grew up in Nebraska so it was like um yeah i i listen to it once in a while but it's it's probably not my my top mode i guess that's pretty pretty popular down in Plano though uh
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				um yeah we've i mean it you know there's you have all sorts here too um
 				i went to a pretty uh
 				well the school i went to was Texas A&M an and uh  either you either you went country western dancing or uh
 			
 			
 				oh yeah
 				so you didn't do anything at all right
 			
 			
 				yeah  pretty much pretty much so so i have i really liked i liked it there but i also also like some of the Christian um contemporary music that they have play
 			
 			
 				huh
 				uh-huh
 				are you into the Garth Brooks thing at all or is that popular down there right now i know that he's kind of a big name right now
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				yeah yeah it's popular here and  uh there's all
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				and you're also into the Christian contemporary stuff
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				yeah i had a i had a roommate that was really into that he was into all the um
 				groups like uh i'm trying to remember DMZ
 			
 			
 				um-hum
 			
 			
 				Resurrection Band uh what else
 				there are a couple of other ones he was into he was into Petra as well
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				in fact it's interesting he he's actually an engineer i don't i i'm going to school in Florida
 				and he's an engineer that does sound mixing mixing right now for a Christian bands
 			
 			
 				oh really
 			
 			
 				so yeah he's pretty into it
 			
 			
 				that's fun
 			
 			
 				it's been it's been lucratim for him
 			
 			
 				well what you you mentioned alternative music
 			
 			
 				well yeah um kind of like
 			
 			
 				what is that
 			
 			
 				i don't know in the early seventies i think it was called punk rock
 			
 			
 				oh okay
 			
 			
 				but then now it's it's kind of taken a different slant and i think it's it's gone more diverse toward
 				um not so much the head banging on the wall stuff as much as just runs
 				really a wider more eclectic uh
 				tone flow and things like that so it's i don't know i like i said i consider myself fairly diverse so um
 			
 			
 				um-hum
 				you said you're also a performer
 			
 			
 				yeah yeah i well i play the trumpet um and also keyboards i played keyboards for about uh oh i don't know twelve thirteen years and played trumpet for about ten so
 			
 			
 				what do you perform
 				do you
 				oh wow
 			
 			
 				it it's good for a side diversion and a little bit of side income you know whenever i can do you do you play anything at all
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				um not on a consistent basis at this point  i've got three kids and they're preschoolers so i do good to  get a book book read or newspaper read or anything so
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				oh wow
 				sure sure free time is not much of a luxury uh
 			
 			
 				yeah yeah
 			
 			
 				i know that feeling
 			
 			
 				in fact i do good to  listen to anything but kids' tapes at this point because i know all the kids' tapes it's like yeah
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				
 				yeah well maybe hey that may be more quality you know after all
 			
 			
 				they do have they do have some good tapes out there for kids we  i don't know um
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				Joe Scruggs is a guy that is out of Austin here that has some wonderful kids tapes it's really i mean they are really fun and uh Joe Scruggs he's with he's an educational
 			
 			
 				Joe Scruggs huh
 			
 			
 				um it's called Shadow Play and if you ever see any of his stuff he is just he's really good and  and um kids really like it
 			
 			
 				interesting uh
 				when you said Scruggs i was thinking because Earl Scruggs is a real famous banjo player a real famous blue grass player
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				and uh in fact if you remember the the theme from the Beverly Hillbillies
 			
 			
 				uh-huh
 			
 			
 				he actually played part of that
 			
 			
 				oh
 			
 			
 				uh he and Lester Flats so uh i was thinking wow wonder if this is a relative
 			
 			
 				i don't know i don't know  well um  have you  um  they're not they're more uh oh have you ever heard of Riders In The Sky i don't know if they're
 			
 			
 				but
 				anyway
 			
 			
 				if they're big up there in fact i think they may have even had a television show on Saturday mornings for kids
 			
 			
 				oh
 				yeah i haven't heard much about that no
 			
 			
 				um
 				they're pretty neat they're kind of a a a blue grass country uh they're real fun i mean they're
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				they're the guys that i mean they can yodel and they can they play the fiddles and the and the saws and stuff and they're real fun they're a real fun group
 			
 			
 				all right yeah kids probably get into that quite a bit
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				i'm uh i'm not quite at that point in my life yet so
 			
 			
 				yeah well yeah
 			
 			
 				it'll probably be a while before i uh before i get into the kids' music in at all so
 			
 			
 				
 				well we saw them originally at a at a club down here um probably about oh seven or eight years ago and um
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				then just in the last i don't know two years we saw them on a TV show  and i think they were i think they were doing kids' music but
 			
 			
 				um-hum
 			
 			
 				what we saw in the you know was adult in the but i don't know i don't know where they run the gamut and i don't know um
 			
 			
 				right
 			
 			
 				you know i don't know if the south is more towards the you know has more of that crowd or not i don't know i don't know do you
 			
 			
 				um-hum
 				well it's yeah it's hard to tell i know you know like in the Appalachian Mountain area there that thing's real popular yeah i i've had some friends from West Virginia that's you know that it's real popular around there
 			
 			
 				uh-huh
 				well
 			
 			
 				and
