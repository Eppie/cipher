 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so have you had to think about uh
 		nursing homes and the elderly that sort of thing in your own life
 	
 	
 		nah not really my parents are still pretty young my father's forty five mother about the same age
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's very young
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 		so that really hasn't been an issue for me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		uh no my parents are getting older my father is uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		seventy and my mother must be about sixty five
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i'm starting to think about it but i haven't had to do anything about it yet uh my grand
 	
 	
 		right have they got any kind of uh supplemental insurance for that or
 	
 	
 		no i'm pretty sure they don't um they have some income from pensions and social security um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but no i don't think they have any insurance that would cover that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've heard about most of that insurance i was wondering because it seems like what i've heard is usually that the stuff says uh kind of thing where they cancel you a couple of years after you get in into the home
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it tends to be kind of useless anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah its my impression those costs are so high that without something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know special you can't handle it anyway uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i think we might uh we talk about having them move in with us
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but there are certain health
 		you know certain health conditions that we wouldn't be able to handle and i think we've just sort of avoided thinking about it real hard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah
 		i don't know it seems to me that for the kind of money a nursing home typically costs you can maybe even afford to
 		to have a nurse come into the home periodically
 	
 	
 		that might be a good alternative i mean it is my impressions tens of thousands of dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		dollars a year at that point yeah it seems like you could hire somebody part time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah what the heck
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and certainly more dignified than uh
 	
 	
 		yeah its
 	
 	
 		than warehousing them
 	
 	
 		it it it does seem like there are a lot of horror stories out there and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's kind of scary because it seems like uh you know a lot of people you know it's it's uh the budgets of these places has gotten so tight
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know they just really can't take care of them very well the budget and staffing especially if it's a state run
 	
 	
 		i saw something on Sixty Sixty Minutes a few months ago about nursing homes in Texas that was a real you know horror piece
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah it seems like every time i see something on television it's not good
 	
 	
 		yeah so and i guess you know we have to think about gee maybe we have another forty years before we'd end up in that sort of situation is it possible we could
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		put away enough money to handle it ourselves
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems that way
 	
 	
 		huh um do you do you have grandparents who are left
 	
 	
 		yeah i sure do they're they're pretty healthy everybody in my family seems to die when they're they're in good health but they get to be like seventy or eighty and all have aneurisms just drop dead
 	
 	
 		well that's could be worse i think
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you know that's pretty good way to go
 	
 	
 		if i could live until seventy or eighty and have an aneurism and drop dead i'd probably
 	
 	
 		i'd be happy
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think that might be sufficient might be sufficient
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's the worst part um seems to me that a lot of times people wind up in nursing homes who tend to survive major things like strokes or uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		heart attacks that sort of thing and then you know they can't really help themselves so they have to be cared for
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i mean it seems like in a case like that you'd need more help than ever to uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to more more support and some way to live a fulfilling life and it doesn't seem like those people are getting it
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it seems like they'd be almost just you know better off just withholding care to some some degree
 	
 	
 		well it's always a tough question you know i mean with not only the elderly but sick people in general you know when do you withhold and when do you not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well it seems to me it's a little bit easier with the elderly because you know at least they've lived a life
 	
 	
 		you would think yeah i mean you'd think hey the clock's bound to run out at some point
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah
 		yeah it's something it's something like fifty percent or greater of all health care expenses are in the last five years of life
 	
 	
 		yeah um you my wife is a nurse and she tells me stories about uh
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the things that people are put through the so heroic measures they're put through when they're very sick some of them are very old and some aren't that uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		everyone really knows isn't going to make a real difference but they're sort of left not knowing what else to do than everything they can do
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		seems like uh unfortunately that many of those people who are put through those if they'd uh let their wishes be known ahead of time frequently they wouldn't have been interested in heroic measures and
 	
 	
 		yeah my wife has certain certain wishes that she doesn't want certain procedures done and i just hope i can remember what they are  it comes time to deal with it
 	
 	
 		if that's the case then
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yeah well i don't know my wife's a medical student and uh you know we got some of the uh Journal of the AMA and American Medical News thing and it seems like that physicians unless they're in writing or video tape or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that they're kind of in a
