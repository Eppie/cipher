 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so Martin how do you feel about crime in the city uh you said you're from Atlanta
 	
 	
 		right i i i actually i live in the city and uh i guess it is a concern of mine uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know for my own safety
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i mean do you find do you find crime in Atlanta really bad i mean i live in Atlanta also
 	
 	
 		oh that's right um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i think it is bad in certain areas however i think uh the area that i live in it's not
 		uh the the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city i think it seems that there's certain certain areas where uh the crime is focused um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city
 	
 	
 		well i think it's what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it had some impact but not a tremendous amount
 		and probably um
 		they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think's the best way there is
 	
 	
 		i'd probably agree with that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you know uh particularly in some of the housing projects
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused and they've got to do more than just having having cops there they've got to kind of change the way people think about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's probably true um
 		so do um well do you think Atlanta is as bad as most other cities
 	
 	
 		um well i've been to i'd say it's it's probably in the top
 		top ten in terms of crime
 		um
 		it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example probably not not as bad as Detroit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i don't think it's as bad as LA either
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		we i don't think we don't we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have
 	
 	
 		yeah that seems to be true um yeah if you've ever been to like New York City and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed it's that obvious
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		i know i've i've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's gonna just just keeping your senses about you and you know trying not to look like a victim
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		you know walk with you know walk with you know with
 	
 	
 		with a big stick or
 	
 	
 		well  not silly just walk you know confidently and you know don't don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		sure  right don't don't walk down a an alley or don't get just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation but yeah there are times when you can't avoid all that um and and then you're kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		on your own
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and if you have you ever have you ever been mugged in Atlanta
 	
 	
 		uh no the only thing i've ever had is i've had my wallet lifted
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but that was in a more of a
 		a a setting where there was a number of people around and i kind of got  i was much younger at the time and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and kind of passed it off so i didn't know who had it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've had that happen but that's that's about it
 	
 	
 		yeah i've been pretty lucky about getting mugged i don't
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and that's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that i've seen in Atlanta and that and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed
 	
 	
 		really well i've had my
 		um-hum i've had my car stolen so maybe that counts
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wow where was where where was that was that downtown or
 	
 	
 		oh no that was in the northern part um up near Cumberland Mall area it's actually Cobb County but it is Atlanta
 	
 	
 		really
 		um-hum metropolitan yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh there's a lot of car thefts in that area
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've actually i've known known some people that have had their cars stolen
 		um
 		and uh and uh you know but half the time they seem to
 		the APD seems to recover them you know in in various states of disrepair  up on blocks you know my friend who had a um
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		VW Rabbit and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in in his front seat
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage but they didn't they didn't strip it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i got it back
 	
 	
 		well you're probably luckier than
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		than most
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 		so does like insurance pay for the body damage or was that was that all it was body
 	
 	
 		right it it was about three grand to put everything together they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah you've got to you crack the steering column then you pull the there's a pin in there that you can pull on these GM cars and you can start start it up basically pretty easily
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		so how do you know this much about um stealing cars
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well after i found mine i had to i had this
