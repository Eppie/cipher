 
     		
 	
 		okay i guess we're talking about exercise huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		yeah yeah well first of all i i have have to ask you how how old you are
 	
 	
 		oh i am twenty seven
 	
 	
 		twenty seven okay yeah well i am quite a bit older than you are  but no i i think exercise is extremely important and i i do exercise on a regular basis
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you do what type of exercise do you do
 	
 	
 		well i do um jazzercise which is an aerobic um
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		program that are you familiar with it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it's uh you know a national company and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes like all day long so you can
 	
 	
 		is that different from aerobics or is it the same thing
 	
 	
 		no it's really it's it's an aerobic routine you you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again
 	
 	
 		and you do that every day
 	
 	
 		no i only do it  probably two or three times a week
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		the minimum they want you to do is three times a week
 	
 	
 		oh and this is a club or uh do you belong to a group
 	
 	
 		well it's really a
 		i mean it's called a center and you buy as many classes as you want to a time and then you just go in whenever you can
 		so like i usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings
 	
 	
 		do you go with friends or do you go alone
 	
 	
 		no i go by myself and and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise or they might play tennis
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and since i am not a tennis player um you know i don't get that but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties so um there aren't many people you know that want to do that most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know with with children between the ages
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  young mothers or yeah
 	
 	
 		young mothers you know young women with with small children are the ones that i find well what do you do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh i really don't have a routine i like playing basketball we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop and that's what i do everyday
 	
 	
 		oh great
 		yeah so you play everyday
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty much when my wife let's me
 	
 	
 		well now who do you play with do you have friends that play with you or just
 		you know
 	
 	
 		no i just shoot around by myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh that's about it i use to play soccer a lot in high school but when i graduated i haven't done much i don't have a problem i know i have to do more aerobics but i don't have a problem with weight i could eat all day and not gain an ounce
 	
 	
 		well see that's that's that's really good and i think that keeps a lot some people from exercising
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean i don't have a problem with weight either but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise you know i mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin and it's because i exercise but i also watch what i eat
 	
 	
 		you do exercises
 		you do exercise
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know but you'll come being being twenty seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet but as you get older you will
 	
 	
 		yeah and i
 		well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days but
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		well it might not  it might not because everybody's been telling me that too and so far it hasn't happened you know and i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess i enjoy sports a lot so that's why i've kept active in that way
 	
 	
 		yeah but you don't play any other sports but basketball
 	
 	
 		uh basketball volleyball um
 		just about it just not really heavy just as far as recreation or hobby i do that
 	
 	
 		but do you ski being in Utah i was wondering if you skied
 	
 	
 		um i used to but it got too expensive so
 	
 	
 		oh did it really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i know that skiing in Utah is is suppose to be great
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of people do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and but well i just i never find the time i had rather do other things
 	
 	
 		yeah well i have never skied before but i have friends that go to Utah all the time and they think it's really and they ski i guess there's a place where you can ski where was it Tahoe where you ski from
 	
 	
 		oh they come up here
 	
 	
 		no that's Nevada to California i guess yeah i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line
 	
 	
 		that's in Nevada uh-huh
 		oh yeah but
 	
 	
 		but there's a funny there is a place in Utah called a funny name
 	
 	
 		there's Snow Bird or Alta
 	
 	
 		but it's like oh Heavenly is that it
 	
 	
 		Heavenly
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's called Heavenly
 	
 	
 		huh i've never heard of that one huh-uh
 	
 	
 		you've never heard of that
 		well maybe it isn't in Utah i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they said they've skied Heavenly and  it sounded like you know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place it was kind of funny
 	
 	
 		do they exercise much or i mean for skiing i know when i went you can get sore easily but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you can get really sore i know you i can mean i've talked to people but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore
 	
 	
 		oh yeah see i'm this one or two timer a year if i do go and i am really sore after
 	
 	
 		and
 		and then is it your your quadriceps that are this worst you mean your legs and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my legs really really ache
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's i am using muscles that i have never used before
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well and it's strange that like you can do like i did aerobics you know all the time and then i went horseback riding
 		and still i was so sore and i couldn't get over
