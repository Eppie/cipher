 		and actually i'm pretty hot about the topic right now yes i am
 	
 	
 		oh you are
 		you're you're into uh recycling
 	
 	
 		i'm into recycling i've got several friends who use me as their recycling drop off matter of fact
 	
 	
 		um-hum what materials do you recycle
 	
 	
 		i recycle glass plastic and aluminum
 		also paper and plastic bags
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i uh in Dallas we recently had a report on the news in the evening
 		about what's being done with the recycled the recycling materials
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and green glass and several other items but green glass in particular is being tossed into the landfills
 		and i got really hot about that because my husband my husband drinks a lot of ginger ale and it's packed in green glass
 	
 	
 		so
 		so you're trying to take action to have that changed
 	
 	
 		well yeah i'm i'm racking my brain thinking okay where can i what can i do to take action on this the only recycling plant i think in the south is in Atlanta
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're paying i think
 		eighteen cents
 		for every hundred pounds of green glass
 	
 	
 		right so economically it's not a situation where you're going be able to attract a lot of attention
 	
 	
 		no i'm not but i've got
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		good gosh i've got probably
 		twenty or thirty pounds of it in my yard right now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		waiting for a recycling place to take it to and
 		i would really be disturbed if i found out that the place i took it to
 		was going to just put it in the landfill i mean i could have done that
 	
 	
 		well i think um that is kind of becoming one of the drivers now the fact that with all the recycling that took place the price per pound has declined i know aluminum in our area one year ago aluminum was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		forty five cents a pound and now it's twenty last time i went it was twenty two cents a pound
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it uh  there's not a lot of money to be made but it's just a question of trying to help the environment
 	
 	
 		no
 		well that's the that's the thing is  i uh i would rather help my environment and uh when i turn in glass and aluminum i turn it in to my church which has a community center
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the community center uses the money to help with an after school program to help keep kids off the streets and to to give them a fighting chance in the world
 		in regards to education and i think that's a real worthwhile project and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's really what got me started recycling was this uh community center
 	
 	
 		hm yeah where  where i work we recycle paper that's about it
 	
 	
 		so
 		do you which kind of paper computer paper
 	
 	
 		yeah any any um noncolored noncolored or nonfilm type paper just white paper and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		oh any
 		uh-huh
 		oh uh-huh but do they recycle computer paper
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		i mean like the the green and white barred
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh we don't use that kind of paper any more no we have perforated
 	
 	
 		oh you don't use that paper okay
 	
 	
 		for personal printers and then like LaserJet type paper
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we don't use the green bar type paper any more
 	
 	
 		the old the old green bars um-hum
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah because our our church also recycles computer paper and
 		i don't know why i was thinking it was just the old green bar style as opposed to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		even the personal
 		uh letter sized
 	
 	
 		well i would guess that your church is probably at a point where they're not really breaking even on their recycling
 		i mean
 	
 	
 		uh well
 	
 	
 		unless they get volunteers who have people who have trucks and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah we have volunteers and there's not that it's
 		not that wide of a participation participation just yet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so although with my friends helping we we contribute quite a bit of glass we all have children and
 		quite a few of the children are in baby food
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and those baby food jars believe it or not really add up fast
 	
 	
 		right well there are neighborhoods in the Atlanta area where uh you have specific trash bins to put recyclables in and then they're collected on a regular basis
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh yeah curbside recycling
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah they have that in Houston and in Dallas
 		and i saw another report where in Houston they take the bins
 		and they load them up into the truck in the separate areas in the truck
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and the truck goes and dumps all of it into one landfill
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that got me heated up too
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that got me real heated up a friend of my mother's told her about that and she was telling me about it and then i saw a report on TV too
 		and i thought why are we going through this trouble
 		and i had a report tell me why we are we go through the trouble because everybody's worried about the environment
 		and now that we have uh the the smaller the lay people worried about the environment
 		now we have to get the businesses worried about using the recycled product
 		that not that many businesses are
 	
 	
 		right
