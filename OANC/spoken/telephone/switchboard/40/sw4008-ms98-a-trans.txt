 
     		
 	
 		so um do you have a PC
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i have a Macintosh SE thirty
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah one of my friends are into Macintoshes i have a um PC my a IBM PC myself
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a two eighty six but i'm probably eventually gonna get a three eighty six
 		um
 	
 	
 		what do you use yours for mostly
 	
 	
 		um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i'm um i think eventually i'll start using it for spread sheets and things like that um what do you find that you use yours mostly for
 	
 	
 		well i do a lot of word processing and spread sheets and data base and uh about the only thing i am uh i'm just starting to get in into uh a little bit more communications now i've just today ordered a fax modem so i'll be able to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		send and receive faxes right over there without using you know you don't have to make a hard copy that way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh are you using windows
 	
 	
 		no i i think i i'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty six before i move up to Windows although you know i do like the the graphical user environment yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh well it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's just
 		um i want it i want it you know well  i just i just want it more for multitasking which i suppose is also like a Macintosh um
 	
 	
 		um-hum well the one thing i used to use a i've never used an IBM actually i used to use a just an Apple two E which of course is looks pretty primitive now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i used that's what i learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school
 	
 	
 		but i don't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh Mac right now i don't have uh any compilers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i'm uh  wanting
 	
 	
 		well do you use your computer for uh
 		just things around the house or in the in the
 	
 	
 		i use it in my business
 	
 	
 		i see what do you do
 	
 	
 		i uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh English as a second language programs
 	
 	
 		oh wow um and uh are these like uh do these programs um
 		are they are they based on on a on a um
 		other language or are they based are are they based like a lot of the um i know a lot of the the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world
 		and the teacher just tries to tries to teach English you know through natural understanding
 	
 	
 		that's uh exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly you seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well it was just uh when i was high school i worked for the community school and they had a English second language class and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know
 		spoke English not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you don't have as many cues you can't don't have hand gestures and things like that
 	
 	
 		right well now we uh what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though most of the stuff that i do is not uh interactive
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then i use it for testing uh data analysis on testing so
 	
 	
 		oh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that
 	
 	
 		well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know when you when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so it's involves a lot of spread sheet use
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i'd imagine so um
 		so um what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E
 	
 	
 		well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly  and with smaller files  i can't believe you know i've got uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		five uh megabytes on this one now and on my two E i had a hundred twenty eight K
 	
 	
 		um-hum it it's amazing
 		yes it it's amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much i remember my first computer was a TRS eighty with four K on it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know and then then i moved and then i started playing with Apples you know and and those had forty eight or you know if if they were really great they had sixty four K you know
 	
 	
 		oh the old
 		the old Apple uh the the the original Apple had what yeah forty eight i guess didn't it
 	
 	
 		uh all i know i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is all and there's i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty eight K and there was only one computer that had forty eight K on it at the time
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know it's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you i'm not sure about about um Macintoshes but i know in IBM's you you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know that's that's your low that's the low end
 		um
 	
 	
 		well the SE thirty goes up to eight
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk i don't know they say that system seven uses a lot of memory
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah imagine just to support
