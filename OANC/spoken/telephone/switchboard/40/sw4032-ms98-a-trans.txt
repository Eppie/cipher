 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay Martin do you do any exercise
 	
 	
 		yes i do uh i like to uh play basketball and weight lifting those are probably the two main things i like to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		um
 		so those are more or less indoor sports how's the weather out there in Georgia
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um  in in in the winter you typically it's it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis um i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but in the winter it it's gets pretty cold
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um yeah so it's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well yeah i'm on a exercise program i'm riding my Aerodyne bike um half an hour every morning and i'm just about ready to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		up it to forty five minutes a morning and i feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise
 	
 	
 		right do you uh do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh i first of all i'd like to get my weight off i'm about fifty pounds overweight and so i'd like to get the weight off and then i'd really like to get into that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh we have a my husband and i have a a aerobic video that's called The Firm i don't know if you've heard of it but it's a an aerobic video with
 		not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down but you're using weights and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done it is really it's really fun
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yes it's it's it's aerobics it's similar to aerobics with weights
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it's like low impact aerobics where you use weights
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes
 	
 	
 		okay are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics
 	
 	
 		um no i mean yes i am but i have never done it myself have you done that
 	
 	
 		uh yes i have in in Atlanta that's um most of the health clubs
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		are all that's the that's the in thing
 	
 	
 		that's the big thing huh
 	
 	
 		at first it was just regular aerobics but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over
 	
 	
 		oh
 		so how is that
 	
 	
 		um it they call it a low impact aerobics
 		and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and from when i've done it it does give you a good
 		a real good workout
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but the only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know that and movement of going up on the step
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know that could create a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they they seem to think that it it won't but you never know
 	
 	
 		huh
 		now if um playing basketball are you knees do you have healthy knees
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think
 		my ankles probably are my lame weak point but
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've i've kind of taken care of that i wear high tops and then also an an a support ankle brace which is very stiff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um wearing wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's good well that sounds you sound just like my husband he he he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy and so that's what he does he wears his
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		his brace and his high tops and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i did i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh oh shoot
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		it would only take three or four days and i could play again on it
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		because after a while you just learn how to to rehabilitate yourself to play that way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh dear  oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but um so how how successful is your exercise video
 	
 	
 		it is amazing how fast you take off the inches
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i would once i start my forty i'd like to do the forty five minutes a day on the bike for a week and then every other day i'd like to incorporate the video
 		um and then the bike on the other day
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off and the muscle builds
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		real fast um you can start they recommend doing the video without weights
 		for the first month and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty five pound dumbbells
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and it's a hour long video
 	
 	
 		so it's a good workout
 	
 	
 		so
 		it is yeah i really enjoy that so i'm looking forward to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		losing this weight and being firm and healthy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so in the winter i guess there's a lot uh it's quite cold and and snow
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes now this one has been quite mild um
 		we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground
 		it was quite chilly but not
