 
     		
 	
 		it's recycling
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh i think it's a really good thing because um
 		of all the materials we use and things like cans and bottles and stuff like that it's just a complete waste uh you know make them and then throw them away and bury them out in a dump somewhere when you can just as easily melt them down and reuse them
 	
 	
 		exactly i agree
 	
 	
 		and uh there's a i mean there's so many products that are like that it's just too bad that they can't find more that we could recycle
 	
 	
 		well you know i think it all depends on the consumer the more we uh demand from from the people that are producing these goods that they use recycled products the more you know innovative that they'll be
 	
 	
 		yeah you're right there but then there's things like the uh newspaper market where they try and recycle as much as they can and then they no one will
 	
 	
 		there's not a market for it right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		or it ends up costing a lot more to recycle it than it does just to make it so
 	
 	
 		yeah  well uh do you have a recycling program where you live
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh i go to Indiana University here and its real big and all the buildings are recycling bins for all kinds of materials
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  do you have plastics and that kind of kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah and also the uh well the University's really big about it they have contests in the dorms and stuff to see who can uh recycle the most stuff and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so this is like in within the school
 	
 	
 		yeah within the school and also the city here has uh
 	
 	
 		do they have curbside recycling
 	
 	
 		yeah monthly curbside recycling
 	
 	
 		that is nice see we don't have that here it's going that direction but it hasn't come yet at least to my area and uh and i'm really anxious to uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		get that because i mean it's terrible it's really inconvenient for anybody to drive you know on the other side of town and bring all your lug all that stuff you know dirty
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know things and and so i i think that a lot more people would do it if it was you know at their door
 	
 	
 		right but then you do don't you get paid when you take your own uh
 	
 	
 		well it really depends on the product and the place you go some some places will will pay you and some others others won't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um it depends on you know um the demand for the product that you have
 	
 	
 		right sounds like you are an avid recycler
 	
 	
 		i'm on the recycling committee at work so everybody comes to me with all their questions so i try to know as much as possible
 	
 	
 		are you
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh we just at work started recycling cans and um what else and paper you know office paper
 	
 	
 		right yeah we do that at work too
 	
 	
 		but we don't do you know we don't do plastics or glass and those are easily recycled products in a lot of cases
 		but you know you know they have the little recycling triangle
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and some of those numbers in there mean that these products aren't really recyclable
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's kind of inconvenient as well why put recyclable if its in in seventy five percent of the recycling centers you can't recycle it
 	
 	
 		right
 		well aren't there pop cans that are like that also
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		because they have mixed metals or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum yep well anything else
 	
 	
 		well no not really
 	
 	
 		well reduce reuse and recycle right
 	
 	
 		right  words to live by
 	
 	
 		that's right i try to remember them i guess we've covered it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it was nice talking to you bye-bye now
 	
 	
 		you too bye-bye
