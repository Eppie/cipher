 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i pressed i pressed one all right uh on uh
 	
 	
 		all right
 		benefits
 	
 	
 		benefits and um for the uh benefits of working for a large corporation
 		i found the biggest i do work for one now and the biggest benefit is that uh there's a little more in backup when i need it
 		do you work outside of the home
 	
 	
 		yes i do i work for the school system Richardson school
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's a pretty large corporation
 	
 	
 		yes it is and uh retirement's one of the good benefits
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um health care has been a mess
 	
 	
 		no yeah
 	
 	
 		and that can be with a large corporation it used to be but i think that's a mess for everybody now isn't it pretty much
 	
 	
 		yeah it keeps changing because they they have to keep shopping around
 	
 	
 		it keeps i
 		yes for the best where it used to be one of your better you know you you got the whole package with your larger companies and you didn't have that problem
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah do you like working for a large school system compared to a small one
 	
 	
 		yes i think i do i've never worked for a small one so i can't tell you you know but yes i believe the benefits and the pay is much better than you would get in a smaller system
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i think uh course i'm i'm a medical technologist and and in our line of work it's awfully nice to not be out by yourself and that's the biggest benefit i find
 	
 	
 		right
 		um
 	
 	
 		because um you have more backup and more people to call on with problems that may arise and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		of course uh you know it uh it varies with the situations
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		do you have good resources in your school district
 	
 	
 		right we do have very good resources they're excellent
 	
 	
 		yeah to my mind that's the best thing for working for a big place
 	
 	
 		and they're
 	
 	
 		um is how about you how do you feel about that
 	
 	
 		well it's an important aspect of it i feel you know it is it it is an important aspect
 		as far as um
 		being having having everything available to you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the uh counseling and the whole
 	
 	
 		whole ball of wax
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		what would you like to change in your benefits
 	
 	
 		right
 		well probably the major one would be the medical
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i would like to change see a better package for the money you know it but but i guess we all would and they keep cutting us from the you know they keep cutting from the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you have to pay
 	
 	
 		medical into the dental is so expensive where we used to get it and you used to get the eyes and the whole thing and you don't get any of that any more you know it's all separate and it's all so very high if you do get it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah well ours is
 	
 	
 		and that's very frustrating and it i can't imagine how the younger families do it
 	
 	
 		well it's it's difficult
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i know uh ours has improved over what it was because we just went to a larger corporation and that's what helped it improve but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the one thing i'd like to see in our profession is our retirement benefits are almost pathetic
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that's how i'd like to improve ours
 	
 	
 		um-hum i was i was just going to say the retirement is fair for teachers but my husband has retirement too and it's not good though we've had to i mean we're building our own you know
 	
 	
 		oh well you have to
 	
 	
 		you have to any more you can't count on companies on that any more that and that's another thing that's changed the the medical and the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh you have to if you're smart
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		retirement benefits from large corporations it's kind of it's it's like it was set you know you were really set for life really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well in the large corporations the one the thing you have to be so careful of now is being cut when you are almost at retirement age and
 	
 	
 		uh uh-huh
 		yeah yep yep that's right right before
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's that's kind of rough
 	
 	
 		that's yeah i remember um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my mother talking in the forties for her her father was cut you know they went through this same thing in the forties that they're doing now they were cutting men at forty five and fifty years old and that's what they're doing again it's like a recycle of the whole
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when they see they're gonna have to pay all those benefits and all or it's getting close to a time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it happens
 	
 	
 		they bring in they bring in the younger blood that they don't have to pay as high and
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh course i think they're losing an awful lot of valuable expertise
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i do too and the wisdom behind it all it's yeah and you know that's got to count that's got to add in all their production the whole works
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i used to to be in actual management and hiring and we figured it cost us probably at least a thousand dollars on each turn off and rehire
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because of all the paperwork and different departments that had to work on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it was uh
 		it's expensive and i don't know why they don't build that into it but i guess
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well it's cost again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know cutting costs
