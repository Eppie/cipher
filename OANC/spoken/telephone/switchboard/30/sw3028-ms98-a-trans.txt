 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you ready
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		she didn't announce that to you
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't i didn't quite hear all of it
 	
 	
 		oh i see that's fine um i think uh that's pleasurable for all of us  if we  choose the right restaurant
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so what are your thoughts on dining out
 	
 	
 		well i i really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else
 	
 	
 		not for the price
 	
 	
 		well a little bit for the price but uh i think that as far as quality of food goes the most some of the most expensive places i've been had the the really the the worst quality of food
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh-huh
 		the
 		really okay
 	
 	
 		really um a lot of places that even don't look don't look like much some of the some of the best food i have ever had was out of a outside or inside of a place that we drove up and i was like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm not eating in there  are you nuts and uh we went in and it was the most it was the most wonderful food
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my word it's like mama in the back kitchen huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm serious
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um a lot of
 		uh one place that we went just recently uh was to Atchafalaya no that's not right that's not right that's not right  what's the name of that restaurant
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		the Hari Krishna
 		Kalachandji's it's all vegetarian and it was just fabulous i mean my husband was aghast because i ate turnip greens and liked it
 	
 	
 		wow and where was that at
 	
 	
 		um Kalachandji's it's uh it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant
 	
 	
 		where is it in Dallas
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		is it in the phone book
 	
 	
 		uh i think so it should be
 	
 	
 		do you know how to spell it
 	
 	
 		uh it starts with a K
 	
 	
 		okay Kalli K A L L I
 	
 	
 		so
 		K A L A i think C H A N D
 		that should get you close enough to
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		to be able to find it i think it's uh probably listed in the restaurants you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh section yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it's uh it's just fabulous food
 	
 	
 		what about fast foods do you have a preference if you were going to eat a fast food
 	
 	
 		well we like Arby's
 	
 	
 		you do like Arby's see i don't like Arby's
 	
 	
 		as far as fast food goes oh really why
 	
 	
 		no because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever they use the they use the insides of the animals heart and liver and they they form it and they make it look like roast beef and i said no thank you
 	
 	
 		oh no no no someone has been lying to you what they use is roast beef
 	
 	
 		well that's not what i heard from one of somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about
 	
 	
 		that's what
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm surprised my dad worked for Arby's for several years
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		unless somebody is trying to blackball them
 	
 	
 		well that's happened before but we like good uh we we're we like Mexican food
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and stuff like that so um
 	
 	
 		how about the health food uh restaurants
 		well like this one but it's probably not advertised as such is it
 		or
 	
 	
 		a health food
 	
 	
 		uh-huh health food uh restaurants that
 	
 	
 		like like name one  i'm not sure what you're talking about
 	
 	
 		well
 		well like um
 		well i can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between but they ought there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious
 		you know as far as their cholesterol levels and their their fat content and you know the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product and they list them now there's one restaurant that does that and it's called Rodolfo's over on
 		Preston Road and Royal Lane i believe and they  have very good food over there
 	
 	
 		hum
 		i don't guess i've ever been to anything like that so i really don't have anything to compare it to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh they do list um you know list the fat
 	
 	
 		it would be good i think uh i don't know how expensive they are it sounds like that it would probably
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		well it was pretty reasonable i it was around ten dollars for lunch
 		okay which which is kind of high for lunch i guess
 	
 	
 		for one person
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		a bit
 	
 	
 		uh but um
 		you were served by maitre d's and and uh um
 		men waiters
 	
 	
 		see i i won't really be interested in going to going there because i feel like i'm i'm paying you know five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well without
 	
 	
 		well if you're looking for a nice
 		uh-hum well i guess if you were having if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant it's a special occasion type thing yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah maybe maybe that yeah
 		yeah i could see that then maybe
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 		and now the Red Lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime
 	
 	
 		yeah i like the the seafood that they when they had it you know the broiled
 	
 	
 		because they're
 		well they have lunch specials that you can't you can't beat that price uh if you went to a cafeteria
 	
 	
 		yeah probably that's true but i know a lot of their a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things that you can't really get away from the fried
 	
 	
 		well i had the i had a broiled chicken breast and it was excellent
 		it was a marinated broiled chicken breast and it was excellent
 	
 	
 		now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken that's one of my husband's pet peeves he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak you know
 	
 	
 		oh it was
 		well i've never had catfish either in a
 		restaurant because i'm from the north and that was a no no and i haven't gotten over that from the north
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh catfish is wonderful oh really
 	
 	
 		i know they say that that is but i'm
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		but they've got all these caution signs now on fish
 		and so i kind of stay away because of all the pollution in the lakes and the
 	
 	
 		why
 		oh
 	
 	
 		everywhere i mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		i and especially uh in Wisconsin and Michigan they say don't buying of our fish
 	
 	
 		that's too bad because i'm probably not going to stop eating it
 	
 	
 		i
 		
 
 		well
 		yeah so you i
 		and the the best brand of chicken to buy is the uh
 		Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to promote uh unnatural growth in their products
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		so i mean we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so i'm i you know i
 	
 	
 		oh on one hand i see that and on the other hand uh my older sister
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		remembers when uh at one point they were taking radioactive wastes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and storing them in tin barrels which i i guess had a half-life of oh five years if they sit empty on dry land
 	
 	
 		corrode
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically and then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good
 	
 	
 		oh and then they wouldn't sink they were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them and this is before i was born
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so i mean we're taking thirty years ago this happened and
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 	
 	
 		and who's you know the tuna is radioactive
 	
 	
 		that's right everything we eat everything
 	
 	
 		to a certain extent you can't get away from it so i think
 	
 	
 		everything we eat should have a label on it  yeah
 	
 	
 		to some point yeah you know so there's you know there's some things i think we can avoid we you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like you know this is not in my control
 	
 	
 		well you know
 	
 	
 		so i'm either going to be i'm either going to starve to death or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well Becky you know even if you lived off your own land that you would have to put caution signs
