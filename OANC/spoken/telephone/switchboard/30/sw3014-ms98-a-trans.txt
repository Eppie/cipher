 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		are you ready to start okay
 	
 	
 		yes
 		have you recently bought a new car Catherine
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i just found out that my car was thirty months old and it doesn't seem like it's that old seems like i just bought it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		it's an eighty nine and i bought it uh
 		in uh eighty eight so yeah
 	
 	
 		well i really i the last car we got was a was a used car i really don't prefer buying a new car i like to let somebody else pay for that
 	
 	
 		i know i really will do that the next time i buy it too
 	
 	
 		but uh mine was a year old and we bought it for very functional purposes and that was we bought a station wagon we wanted an economical car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to operate but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment
 		so we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon and i've never been sorry however the need for that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's wonderful
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		kind of car
 		has changed now
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh while it is still good and it's quite serviceable and i'll drive it until it no longer is reliable and probably then some  i spend a lot of time praying over it before i give it up
 	
 	
 		um
 		um
 		
 
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i think that i would like to if i you know we all say if i could have the car i always wanted
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i would either buy a Nissan Maxima
 		uh i'm sold on Nissans i or or or foreign cars actually uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but you feel though uh craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 	
 	
 		is that how you i have never
 	
 	
 		its reliability it's reliability
 	
 	
 		its
 	
 	
 		and uh i you know i've read all the Consumer Reports and things and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars if Ford was a head and the shoulders above it i'd buy a Ford
 	
 	
 		isn't that a shame
 	
 	
 		but i had uh had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it
 	
 	
 		my word isn't that sorry that's sorry
 	
 	
 		uh you know i mean it was ready for the graveyard and i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car
 	
 	
 		my word
 		oh mercy
 	
 	
 		so and that was just trying to hold us getting out of that was a used car and it was an older car but you know Escort is supposed to have a great track record
 	
 	
 		you'd
 		um
 		um
 		hm
 		hum
 	
 	
 		as far as sales
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		it's just it just was not  and you get stung a time or two and you say no thanks so i just trusted the Consumer Reports and the auto
 	
 	
 		sure
 		no thanks that's right
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh reports instead had my son who knows a lot about that study them thoroughly and he gave me four choices of cars to buy an Escort definitely was not among them in fact there wasn't an American car in there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		uh
 		the Nissan came and and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the Consumer Reports said we should get
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it served our needs uh later on his reports the reports that he studied showed that uh Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the area in the class that we were looking for
 		and that and i'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac
 		i really would it's not necessarily prestige but it's comfort uh there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		who makes that car
 	
 	
 		Nissan Maxima
 	
 	
 		i mean but where are they where are they what what is their location is it uh Asian or is it European or who
 	
 	
 		no no no Nissan Japanese
 	
 	
 		oh it is Japanese okay i didn't know
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah and if i couldn't have my luxury Maxima
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then i'd buy me a fancy little red CRX sports car
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean you know every other every one of us have two sides
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah now what about you if you could have the car that you wanted
 		what would you get and why
 	
 	
 		if if if i had the car i wanted gee probably um
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		uh let's see i like the looks of the Lincoln Town Car but i i don't know the performance of it that's a Ford product and you know i would get hung up by my boot straps if i ever if i ever mentioned the Ford product in my family
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh yeah
 		see there
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'll tell you that's sad too because at one time Ford was the best that was made
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		really was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i i really have not seen now a lot of the American cars actually are are parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa
 	
 	
 		can i put you on hold for one minute thank you
 	
 	
 		of course
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that was one minute they hung up
 	
 	
 		okay huh uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh at any rate do you have color preferences or what would be the features that you'd be looking for
 	
 	
 		um
 		well the comfort of a large car the the security of a large car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and the luxuries of a large car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh now color preferences i think i would opt to go with a bronze
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is probably closest to gold that you can get
 	
 	
 		yeah oh wow we like the stuff that glitters
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		good there's nothing wrong with that actually i think probably if i were going to get uh if i were going to be practical which doesn't mean i would be i would prefer white
 	
 	
 		right well practically yes that's
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because simply because it's more visible at night
 	
 	
 		right and it's cooler i believe too when you're driving in
 	
 	
 		and uh-huh um-hum now the interior okay i don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but if i had the little read CRX i guess the interior would have to be black leather and i'd have to live with that and if i got the CRX it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		ah
 	
 	
 		i'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind
 	
 	
 		um can you uh hang on again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		thanks
 		
 
 		i've got the phones for lunch hour
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		just don't mind me if i bounce back and forth
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 	
 	
 		um
 		so you like to listen to uh a lot of music or do is it talk shows
 	
 	
 		no no no i generally would prefer uh prefer to listen to
 		uh well i listen to KCBI a lot but i will listen to the news and the and the traffic and those things at work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		but if i'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time i want some real good classical music i love classical music and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		all the yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		all the characteristics of the instruments
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's true
 	
 	
 		so i do love classical music or at least or or uh contemporary classical
 	
 	
 		do you listen to
 		do you like listen to WRR
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure do WRR and the Oasis are the two that i listen to more than anything else and i do like them and
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'd like to have a compact disk player in a car that would be something that i would really like those compact disks really are good for cars because they don't melt they don't warp you know there's nothing in there that can wrap around the the uh
 	
 	
 		those are nice aren't they yes those are nice um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		rollers or anything it seems seems like a really good answer
 		to portable music that you can choose
