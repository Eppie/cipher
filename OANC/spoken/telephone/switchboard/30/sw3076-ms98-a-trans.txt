 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well well Pat have did you vote in the last election
 	
 	
 		most assuredly
 	
 	
 		oh you did
 	
 	
 		yes ma'am i've voted in every major election since i turned twenty one
 	
 	
 		oh that's great well why do you think people don't
 	
 	
 		don't always vote for somebody i sometimes vote against somebody
 	
 	
 		that makes sense too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think that a lot of it is uh i know that my late husband was simply indifferent he didn't feel like he had any say there was too many people too many  other votes for example uh
 		you know he'd say well look you and i see different sides of the fence if i go vote you'll cancel my vote
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i said i sure will he said so i just won't vote i said then mine counts because you could cancel mine too
 	
 	
 		and
 		then does
 		
 
 		yeah i think i think that's a lot of people just indifferent  i know that i've moved around a lot in the past um three years i've had three different addresses each time i change jurisdictions or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so i just haven't because i mean graduate school or whatever so i haven't kept track of it i did when i lived steadily in one community i always i voted
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but this past time i didn't well actually i voted it for the presidential election but then i didn't vote uh i guess in the two year for uh some legislators and things and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well characteristically in some in the local elections
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		typically those people who vote are those who feel very strongly about an issue
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if i do not feel very strongly about an issue then i see no reason to go vote
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right yeah and that's probably one reason why i voted in the the last election but not really this one because this one really didn't matter that much
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's probably true
 	
 	
 		well of course of course listening to government the instructors you'll find out that everything matters but then you could go crazy worrying about everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you know they also say that most people vote their local politics that that local is far much more important than uh national issues
 	
 	
 		well that's the way you get to national and that's the way you make changes about your neighborhood
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right oh i definitely think so
 	
 	
 		uh i know that i have been involved in preparing and in in uh
 		carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place even something so simple as getting a street light
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in between lights on the end of the block but it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over in the dark and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action and that's completely unnecessary In another particular case they were trying to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		put in a um senior citizen's home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in in an area very near our neighborhood but if you just cross that major street the character of the neighborhood changes and it's less savory
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay and that i was just very i felt very strongly about that those people simply did not have access to safety to security and they were at risk
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it was for elderly people who lived alone and they were going to put a cluster of of houses there for them but even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety
 	
 	
 		no most now that's true
 	
 	
 		and all it all it did was to in my judgment make them easier targets uh-huh yeah easier targets and so we we did get a petition together and we very strongly resisted it and
 	
 	
 		prepare them to be victims yes yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was placed in a actually it was placed clear closer to my neighborhood but it was on the right side of the street
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right side of the tracks yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it it i think that they're they're much more comfortable there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh did they
 	
 	
 		uh i haven't seen too much crime in my neighborhood although we have a good crime watch program but it's it's very serious just across the street
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		did um did you think i know that Texas's last gubernatorial uh election probably brought out a lot of voters
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		did that did that seem to because that really that got national attention national attention i guess having a woman governor running against a man and whatever
 	
 	
 		well
 		no i don't think it had to do to with woman running against man i think it had to do with dirt running against dirtier
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's it it was a dirty election people were calling each other uh names and every bit of the trash it was a it was a dirty campaign
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was a dirty mud slinging campaign
 	
 	
 		well you know what's funny up here uh i live i see a lot of Virginia news and i guess uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Senator Robb and Governor Wilder are active right here and they have some type of wire tapping problem going on and the people in Virginia are complaining see Robb is married to Lynda Bird Johnson
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the people in Virginia are complaining that he is he's using Texas politics in Virginia and they're really complaining big time because they said that we don't have that type of trashy politics up here like they do in Texas all the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so you you guys were getting
 	
 	
 		well of course now that's not all the time we've had some pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah you were getting slandered i think
 	
 	
 		we were having some pretty healthy uh campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races but i historically Texas has had
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		mud and muddier campaigns i mean it's just i think that eventually you know the better people have sensibilities and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage unfortunately that's not always the way it should be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you don't want to vote for the person who is least likely to do damage you want to do the one who can do the most good
 	
 	
 		do the most good yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i guess that's why i know that um
 		i'm previously from Pennsylvania and Dick Thornburg who's now the attorney general is going to run for senator because uh John Heinz a senator from Pennsylvania died in an airplane crash
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i know that they're expecting a gigantic turn out to landslide Dick Thornburg into as into the senate
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because they don't like  the governor the governor's political appointee or whatever and they're almost expecting landslide
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		out uh turn out right now for  for that election
 	
 	
 		okay so you
 		so you see that's very negative motivation isn't it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		isn't that too bad
 		we really could use a little positive motivation hey we think this guy can really make some changes and we're going to support him that was true in a lot of cases in in a couple of the older sixties campaigns
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		what in Texas was that when you
 	
 	
 		no i'm talking about national campaigns yeah uh even when John Kennedy was elected there were so many strikes against him but there were people who believed he could make a difference now
 	
 	
 		that's that's true yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's not to say what has transpired or what really was i'm saying that's how it was perceived
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's right that's perception that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		because the those were big political that was a big um turn out election
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		absolutely and and it was people going to vote for i think more than those who voted against
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i know i know that in my own uh
 		area of people whom i knew and how they were going to vote they didn't go to vote against uh a politician as they did
 		a little bit later when Nixon was running they went to vote against the less of lesser of the two evils in certain cases
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i think that one was one that you had some very strong feelings among people and they voted their convictions
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh well i think that also happened with Ronald Reagan
 	
 	
 		absolutely you're right
 	
 	
 		he was he was landslided in and people really saw that was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
