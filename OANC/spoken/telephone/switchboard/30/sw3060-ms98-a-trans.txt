 
     		
 	
 		okay do you like to listen to music
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i like to listen to music i just am not a very educated person when it comes to music
 	
 	
 		well i'm not either as far as Bach and Beethoven and all that
 	
 	
 		what what do you like to listen to
 	
 	
 		well it's really strange i like country music and my husband likes the older rock and roll stuff so we've had to kind of educate each other
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's been kind of strange
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure
 	
 	
 		yeah but being in from Texas from Austin you'd think you get a lot of good country music
 	
 	
 		well i'm not originally from Austin i'm from Minnesota so it took me moving to Texas to start liking country music
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and now i really do i'm i'm really becoming Texanized
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well have you ever gone to Austin City Limits
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i haven't but i watch it on i watch it on um television sometimes and and uh i've taken country western dance lessons oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh you have did you like that oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i love it i absolutely love it
 	
 	
 		yeah i took that in college one time as an easy course
 	
 	
 		and uh oh yes i definitely am am much more into country
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um so you you which uh singers do you like i mean i can actually name singers i'm i'm not too bad
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well naturally i i like George Strait and uh
 	
 	
 		George Strait
 	
 	
 		and Garth Brooks went to the same college that i went to and he used to play in a little dive there in town  when
 	
 	
 		so you know him from
 	
 	
 		when he was a nobody no i don't know him personally but i do remember going to see him when he was a nobody
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah but i went to see George Strait when George Strait was a nobody too
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so yeah i've kind of followed them
 	
 	
 		well who are you going to go see now i mean who do you see now that's going to be somebody someday
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i really like um what's his name Jackson what's his first name
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i can't think of his first name he's a blonde guy and he sings um
 		Alan Jackson
 	
 	
 		oh Alan Jackson
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		he has some kind of fun country tunes but you know it's really funny because country music has changed so much from when
 		like i remember in driver's ed in high school that that my teacher always liked to listen to country music as we were  driving and i thought oh God this stuff is horrible
 	
 	
 		well okay well maybe it just has changed and maybe it's more accepted all over
 	
 	
 		it really has i mean country music is a lot easier for people to break into as opposed to other fields of music so i think a lot of people start out in country and then try to
 	
 	
 		right and then you you know you kind of think of Alabama you know that kind of brought everyone into a more country and and you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah definitely yeah i used to go see them they weren't nobodies then but i did go see them before they got to be major big stars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so  it was fun but
 	
 	
 		Kenny Kenny Rogers he's kind of country and kind of rock you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i remember because when i was taking driver's ed is right when You Picked a Fine Time to Leave Me Lucille came out and it seemed like every other song on the radio was that song
 	
 	
 		
 
 		had to listen to that one again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but it's fun i really i i enjoy listening to it i i keep my radio on at the office but i don't you know i don't have it turned up real loud unless it's a really good song
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and then you just you you pump up the volume yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah just a little see it's real funny because the guy that i work with is from um New Jersey and he is trying to learn now about country music he's gotten to where he really likes it but he doesn't know any of the names of the people or
 	
 	
 		from New Jersey yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah  just yeah i was so amazed
 	
 	
 		that's like about the farthest call from country music you can get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but he's got he's real funny because his office is across from mine and so he'll turn up the radio real loud and say who's this singing
 	
 	
 		oh that's great where do you work
 	
 	
 		i work for a computer company
 	
 	
 		oh that's super
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's fun because it's small enough that we can do stuff like that and get away with it
 	
 	
 		so you can do things like that yeah i'm i'm i'm being envious well one thing that i did in music that i mean was a big extravagance for me but
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i have two daughters that are eleven and fourteen and Whitney Houston just came to town and and she was coming to town the same day that my daughter was getting her braces off so i and i really like her so i thought well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		we'll we'll go buy tickets and this is how we'll celebrate getting braces off teeth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and she really she really i i wouldn't say it was the a great concert
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		not that i've had that many but i know it wasn't a great concert you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it wasn't a bad one either and the one thing that i really appreciated in going to hear her sing in person is
 		her extreme volume for that tiny little body you know and she really does have to work to get it all out
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and you'd you wouldn't catch that you know off of a  a CD or a cassette you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well did you happen to see her um welcome home show on the HBO for the troops
 	
 	
 		i did not no
 	
 	
 		she had so much energy i mean she danced and danced and danced  and i thought golly that's like a two hour aerobic class
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i know i know so that that was really really fun um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be neat i didn't know she was going to be in Austin
 	
 	
 		yeah that was just last week
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		huh well that's neat
 	
 	
 		so we had a good time
 	
 	
 		yeah well are you familiar with Don Henley at all
 	
 	
 		i'm not
 	
 	
 		he um used to play with The Eagles have you do you know anything about them
 	
 	
 		i know Eagles uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay well he was one of the original Eagles and he's broken off now and gone solo and he was in Dallas Saturday night and put on a wonderful concert he sang
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		for like three hours and he sang a lot of old stuff and a lot of his new stuff so it was really exciting
 	
 	
 		well you know now that you mention it i probably had would know you know know a song of his
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm sure yo ur daughters do
 	
 	
 		oh yes i well they're you know they know everything and then they always ask me if i know sport figures too so i'm a real flunky you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i in fact i had older singers so or older older singers older sisters
 	
 	
 		oh so they kind of
 	
 	
 		so i got to listen i got to listen to Herman's Hermits and all that stuff so that was fun
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's but it's really funny now because i'll i'm going to be thirty in August and it's sad because i listen to the oldies' station and i know all the songs
 	
 	
 		i know i know
 	
 	
 		it's kind of depressing
 	
 	
 		it is it's it's sad when you reach that age
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		but you're not doing bad i have a a good friend that i mean she's much older than i am she's i think about fifty eight
 		and she's really up on all the new music even better than i am and and i mean she just likes music and she's just a person that's really with it so maybe you'll be like she is
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah
 		well i hope it's really funny though because i'll be at the club working out and i'll hear the aerobics music going and i'll think God that's a remake of an old song
 	
 	
 		right right  and it really gets bad when you can remember what you were doing oh i remember
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know  remember the original
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh and we're we're just getting to that age where we date ourselves all over the place
 	
 	
 		oh i know it's pretty sad but it's real funny with my husband too because he really likes older rock and roll so
 	
 	
 		did he really like Beatles
 	
 	
 		yeah he i mean he's got Beatles and Crosby Still and Nash and you know all those songs that that my sisters know i mean my sisters listen to Beatles but not any of the other ones i mean like he likes Santana and some kind of off the wall ones so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm getting indoctrinated to a new a new uh line of music
 	
 	
 		you're picking up some new stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah it's fun though we have a good time because
 	
 	
 		oh it is
