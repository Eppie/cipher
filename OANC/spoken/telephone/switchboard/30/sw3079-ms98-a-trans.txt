 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh let's see what do you use or how do you control your money
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well right now we don't have a whole lot of money  so there's not much to control  um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		basically i'm usually the one that uh handles the money um
 		uh my husband's been unemployed for a little more than a year so we've kind of uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's been extremely tight but we've managed somehow
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um we pay the necessities
 		first
 		and uh
 		then
 		from there if there's anything left
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		try and save some of it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		how you want to go ahead and say what you do
 	
 	
 		yeah sure what we uh what we try to do is of course you have to pay your your necessities first right
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know your rent and whatever else and uh and then after that we always put away some money for savings no matter how much it is uh you know how little or or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh and then after that then we have then our our you know spending money or whatever for miscellaneous things
 		but one thing that we've used and it's it's kind of good because it gives you kind of a savings plan sort of
 		and uh what it is we have a ledger you know just a a book and in it in it we have different accounts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh that let's say i would save a hundred dollars a month or something that's what would go into savings for instance
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh we have it so that in that ledger you know the bank just has it as a hundred dollars going into savings
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well what we do is we take that ledger and we take that hundred dollars and we break it down into different categories
 		so for instance uh let's say twenty dollars would go to to the cars you know car repair maintenance or whatever another
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so you've already got it there when you've got the
 	
 	
 		right and another twenty dollars would go to our clothes another twenty dollars would go to uh you know kids toys or something you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so that then when we want to spend money on clothes or have the car you know serviced or something like that then we just go to that
 		you know that page on the ledger and say okay you know we have whatever saved like a hundred and twenty dollars for clothes so we can go spend you know whatever how you know up to a hundred twenty dollars
 	
 	
 		that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and that's how we kind of keep track of things so that when the car  you know when the car breaks down or something you you have some money at least you know earmarked for that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and it seems to work
 	
 	
 		you don't just go overboard spending too much of the savings on one particular thing
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		that's a good idea when we have some money we'll do that
 	
 	
 		and so it you know it seems
 		
 
 		it it seems to work pretty good you know the only part is you got to keep track of it you know every every month of stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that seems to work pretty good and uh the other things we do is just uh
 		just try to uh
 		just try not to spend a whole lot you know with some things of course you have to you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we try to you know make sure where we go and uh try to catch something on sale or or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but how about you guys
 	
 	
 		well some that's there there're several things i do to save money um one is to use garage sales
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we do a lot
 		
 
 		get a lot of things used
 		and the things that we do have i try and recycle a lot you know before i'll get rid of something i'll look at it and think what else can i do with this and uh how else can i use this
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to solve some other problem somewhere else you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh that has helped a lot um
 		and i do shop the sales and buy more than what we need
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that i've got it ahead of time and i don't have to go out and buy it something not on sale because i've already gotten it on sale
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then when the sale comes around again
 		go ahead and stock up again
 	
 	
 		well that's a good idea yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		have you gone to any of those places that uh you know like uh uh uh i guess the different names for them are like the Price Club or Sam's or
 	
 	
 		Sam's um we have a Sam's not too far away but i haven't uh used it yet
 	
 	
 		things like that
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh they're going to they're building a new one that's going to be even closer
 		and i'm i'll probably use it when it's over here even a little closer
 	
 	
 		that's
 		yeah i've been in a couple and it seems like you can get pretty good uh you know stretch your money there because you get the the big things you know
 	
 	
 		yeah you have to buy quantity
 	
 	
 		right right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um that's how you save money you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and that's and uh one of my i recently got a master's in computer systems science or computer systems
 		and one of the things i really learned a lot was uh there's a number of programs for the computers if you happen to have a personal computer or whatever that a lot of programs that'll help you budget your money and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's kind of really neat because it does a lot of things for you as far it gives you all your graphs and your charts and stuff and show you where you're spending money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so if you're really honest about inputting everything that you spend your money on you'd be you you're really surprised at like boy you know i spend a whole lot of money on like candy or something you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i think there's an awful lot of things that we spend money on that we really don't need
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think since being unemployed we look you look at things more carefully you know do i really need this or is it just something i want
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and you have to
 		decide how much you want and and i think uh i've noticed that however much money you have you can spend that much
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or more you know people people will go beyond what they have no matter what they have if they use credit cards that's one thing we're trying
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		try not to do is to use the credit cards because that just runs
 	
 	
 		right that can get you in trouble pretty quick
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah if you and i really like paying cash instead of checks even um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we got changed to an economy account at the
 		credit union so it costs less to use less checks
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um
 		those are just little things you can do
 	
 	
 		well that sounds that sounds pretty good
 		well do you have anything else to say or any other
 		plans that you use uh i like what you say about the recycling thing looking at something before you get rid of it that's a good that's a good thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i uh
 		having a garage sale yourself helps
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we just had one this last week end
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well we did we did something like that too we recently moved here from California and we had a there was like a bargain fair you know where everybody brings stuff to sell
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and there really we made a lot of money i was surprised a lot of baby clothes we sold and stuff that we don't need any more and stuff but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i was surprised yeah that's a good way to make some money
 	
 	
 		yeah when you can't use it any more
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		that's uh
 		i think uh learning how to do things yourself a lot helps too like i cut everybody's hair myself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		and if you can uh just watch how they do it at the
 		uh shop or
