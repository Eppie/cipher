 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		yes i've had i've had a number of them in my lifetime and i've i am a golden retriever fan but i had to replace it with something that the kids could carry yes yes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh  instead of being carried
 	
 	
 		yes well they were they really wanted something teeny tiny and i uh really wanted that retriever's disposition uh the ultimate to tolerant trainable disposition so i called
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 	
 	
 		four or five dog trainers because i don't like the little dogs and and i asked them you know these are the ages of the kids what do i get
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they all said golden retriever and i said okay put it under twenty pounds and the only thing that they could come up with was a bichon frise which is a do you know what that is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh yes i've seen those they're cute
 	
 	
 		they're cute they look like an airheaded dog but let me tell you they're calm they're not yappy they're trainable
 		they're uh very personable in a different way that a golden retriever is they're not dignified like a retriever can be yeah so how old is your retriever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh she's about four she's not completely pure we got her from the uh Humane Society when she was a puppy she looks like a golden she looks just like a golden retriever but she's a little bit smaller she's like fifty five pounds
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well actually you know that's the breed standard for females what you yeah what you see shown and bred now as golden retrievers this you know plus eighty to a hundred pound range
 	
 	
 		is it
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that is not breed standard fifty five is the minimum but they usually run about sixty to sixty five and the ones that are shown
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they are inside that weight allowance you cannot show your retriever if it's you know a hundred plus pounds so don't say she's small just say she's perfect
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh huh
 		yeah she's perfect well she's got a brown nose instead of black too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which makes her i guess unshowable even if she had papers which she doesn't but but we love her anyway she's just a lot of company to us we didn't
 	
 	
 		yep
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we haven't had any kids and we're expecting a baby this summer but up until then she's been our substitute kid and she was a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		well they are they are the ultimate dogs to have around kids so long as your kids not scared of a big dog because i had a retriever actually i had a retriever Irish setter cross
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh
 	
 	
 		which is a really nice animal and fortunately it was just like a retriever and then i've had a retriever
 	
 	
 		i bet it had a pretty coat too
 	
 	
 		it was gorgeous it was just gorgeous i mean just gorgeous um and they both you know both the half breed and the pure breed had the um
 		what i consider the the the perfect disposition but you know what you know what scares me about golden retrievers
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		since they've become so popular you get what i call backyard breeders which is probably where yours came from people that don't know what they're doing and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they breed them you know for a certain characteristic and in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big for somehow big is perceived as better and when you start doing that you really tamper with you know the all the the years of uh
 		culling litters and and uh you tamper with what the dog innately is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we when i was when i bought my last purebred retriever i mean i looked all over because i wanted one that still looked like retriever you know the short to the ground stocky golden
 		uh trainable tractable quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house and i ended up getting one that uh came out of a a a hunting stock because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		dumb retrievers and i'm and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we have some friends with a brother and sister golden retriever and those dogs have been having seizures and i wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of a breeding problem
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah you bet you you bet you you know how they came up with the retriever don't you the golden it was bred out of several different retrievers and they bred it for companionship and uh uh disposition and and ability to hunt it was kept only by kings
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but they selectively culled those litters i mean for many hundreds of years and since it slept in the castle with its master i mean it had it had to be of a disposition to make it you know an animal you could keep around that closely but
 		but they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect now you know that seems like a cruel thing to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on the other hand you sure you know they sure created a a wonderful breed i mean a wonderful breed
 	
 	
 		yeah they did
 		i i had never really had a golden retriever before we were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds and all the other we looked at some of shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh social and stuff and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling  and that was mine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i tell you you know the the German shepherd is the classic case of what i'm talking about because in America that's called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		only in America is there a dog called a German shepherd that dog is bred out of three European dogs the Belgian Tervurien a German schutzhund and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i always forget the third one i can see it uh  but the third one is a children's dog and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		there are distinct breeds in Europe now what happened over here was is that people saw the the first um which would actually have been a schutzhund which is what Rin Tin Tin was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin and it was known as a German shepherd here
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so they created a breed standard the American Kennel Club did that said anything that is a schutzhund a a Tervurien and uh Alsatian that's the other one Alsatian
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here and what happened is is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect and they bred a dog that
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i the it's called a an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that German shepherd the American German shepherd here was a a a such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute refused to use them because they would turn on their on their handlers and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		even um uh police corps which started you know finding other breeds to use because this thing this this thing known as a German shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible
 		so about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this so they went back to Europe
 		and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to a standard what they wanted an American German shepherd to be which is a very heavily now schutzhund and Alsatian and it's the Alsatian that's the kid's dog it's just you see them in Europe and they're just lovely
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but you'll see i mean if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for German shepherds they will say on them bred for disposition AKC conforming
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		which means that their advertising that this is no longer an indiscriminate dog this is bred for and they had to go through and destroy a for a while there about seventy five percent of their puppies that they bred
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		because they were looking for this disposition and nowadays you you'll get you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific you know breeder handler they'll recommend their shepherds as a children's dog but
 	
 	
 		huh
