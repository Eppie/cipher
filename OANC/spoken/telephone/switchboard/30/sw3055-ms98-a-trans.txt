 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		and i guess the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party if we wanted to do something like that or share recipes or something um  are you one who gives dinner parties very often
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh sure
 		right
 		no
 	
 	
 		no nor am i  uh
 	
 	
 		i avoid them with all
 	
 	
 		they're a lot of work that's for sure yes yes
 	
 	
 		yeah they are i mean i do them but they're a lot of work i usually have them when i there's a special event in their lives and i i make a big deal out of it for them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i think i'm uh most happiest with my most familiar foods that i know are successful
 	
 	
 		yeah right yes
 	
 	
 		you know and i have uh i make my own pies and pie crust and you know i can make my pies from scratch i don't need a recipe to follow and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's great you sound like my mother who's been well i bake pies too but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family and she has the same the same technique i mean i guess after so many years of doing it you just kind of do it second nature
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah you just know from heart i had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie and she said make me one and i made her one and when i when she gave me back the plate she said i didn't share this with anybody
 	
 	
 		ah
 		she enjoyed it huh  well there's a a woman in our choir who is almost nearly famous for her apple pies and uh we had a
 	
 	
 		and i thought whoa  that was a big pie yes
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		a an auction one time at the church  excuse me and uh one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars
 	
 	
 		my word she must have a great pie recipe then
 	
 	
 		well i i think i i i've had it once and it's been a few years ago but i do recall that it was quite good so um
 	
 	
 		wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah so that is her specialty um i like to bake um also i don't bake so much now that my children are grown but i do enjoy baking and i guess i always liked making making um
 		cookies and bars and things like that that was more my specialty i suppose and they seem to last longer than pies around here pies just would would go practically in a day's time  yes
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah you that's right yeah they're meant for the that evening
 		dessert and you know it's got to be gone or daddy gets into the you know the leftovers and puts about two more inches on his waistline and then he is  chastising himself afterwards
 	
 	
 		right  and not very happy huh
 		well it's interesting that uh yesterday i had lunch with a friend and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend for friends of hers for um a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		one of her acquaintances one of her old friends i guess had been in town and uh they invited two other couples over and so there were seven of them but uh i said well what did you have and she said what she had uh just Mexican food but you know she had uh uh you know guacamole and
 		uh i can't remember all she had but she also had made uh flan which is actually Spanish i think have you ever made that or had it
 	
 	
 		no i have not huh-uh
 	
 	
 		it's it it it's um
 		i had used to work with a a gentleman who was from Cuba who would make it uh and it's just a wonderful dessert it's like uh a egg custard in a uh caramelized sugar uh was on top of it and it's it's quite
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		actually not very difficult to make but it's very very high in cholesterol i'm sure with all the eggs that are in it but uh
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 	
 	
 		she said that she and her husband had uh traveled in Spain a couple of years ago and and flan is almost uh a basic with every meal that you get there
 	
 	
 		like apple pie in America right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh it's just very customary to get flan so if you ever run into that you'll you'll sort of be aware of what that's all about but uh i would never have thought of making that as part of a a Mexican dinner but
 	
 	
 		wow um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so papillas i guess would be another kind of a dessert if you decided to do something like that but  flan is something you can make ahead and have just uh you know have ready but uh oh i would have been thinking i would like to have a dinner party sometime soon but
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i tell you it that i my it's one of those things where it does require some real uh planning and it's you know you don't just make the dinner you have your house to clean and you know the the whole business that goes with that
 	
 	
 		yes  um-hum
 		well when i have a dinner party that's my motivation for getting the house clean
 	
 	
 		yeah probably a good way to do it  oh the house needs cleaning i guess i better have a dinner party yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we're catering a wedding um
 		in August and uh this lady that is it at it's is at her house she's not a a good housekeeper so she's got to hire this crew
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		of four women to come in of two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready yes and there you know she she must have found some jewels because they start in the corner and work out
 	
 	
 		good heavens
 		uh
 		oh wow that's such a nice thing it's i you know until well we my husband and i've been married twenty six years and until last year i had never had another person clean my house and then i got so involved and so busy i said
 	
 	
 		yeah so um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		this is one luxury i'm going to let myself have every now and then and so i had a woman come in uh once a month you know and which isn't very often but for me it was wonderful
 	
 	
 		sure yeah that's nice you know to have that that's a luxury today
 	
 	
 		well it is and it is it buys you time to do other things like have a dinner party  so it's just a real gift of time as far as i am concerned but well um i better
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 		i i have a pie crust that recipe that i that is unique that has vinegar and egg in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i have heard about that but i've never tried it no um um well i should say i have heard of one that has vinegar in it i don't know that it has egg in it uh-huh uh-huh do you have it right on the top of your head
 	
 	
 		have you okay
 		egg and sugar um-hum um-hum
 		um i no i think it would be too hazy because um the uh no i
 	
 	
 		you don't have it yeah i would i
 	
 	
 		well it's like the liquid is like a half of cup of water and then your egg and then your uh tablespoon of vinegar and you mix that together and then you you know your see it makes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		it makes uh five pie crusts at once so that's it's quite a volume of um
 	
 	
 		uh quite large yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think it's four cups of flour and like uh a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar and and you combine your dry ingredients and then you uh put in your liquid
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		yeah um what is it about the uh the vinegar that uh makes the crust better
 	
 	
 		it just it just makes it very pliable and and very flaky and you can really treat it rough and you're still going to have a flaky pie crust
 	
 	
 		ah
 		interesting
 		yeah yeah boy that the that's the real secret um-hum
 	
 	
 		like uh it's not mine it was from uh one of the magazines probably
 		twenty years ago and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it and it will still be flaky and i thought wow that's quite a statement for them to make
 	
 	
 		oh that it makes me think of years ago um
 		when i was visiting my mother-in-law in uh Michigan and she lived very near an apple orchard and
 		we just had we could take as many apples as we wanted from it according you know according to the owners and so i decided to bake about four pies ahead you know and freeze them
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		well talk about working with big amounts of pie crust and having it be tough  those were the toughest apple crust or apple uh pie crust that i have ever ever made it was just terrible i i could have used that recipe it sounds like
 	
 	
 		oh wow wow
 		well i'm from Michigan
 	
 	
 		where about
 	
 	
 		uh Detroit um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well we lived in um Plymouth for four years um
