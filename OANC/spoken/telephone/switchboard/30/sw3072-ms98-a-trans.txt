 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay where have you all been on vacation recently
 	
 	
 		recently my most recent trip was last year and that was Detroit
 	
 	
 		Detroit is that a nice vacation spot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it wasn't really it was um uh to see an old relative
 	
 	
 		right okay
 	
 	
 		and it was uh just to uh
 		have some fellowship with her
 	
 	
 		right so you probably wouldn't recommend that as tourist big tourist spot
 	
 	
 		no The only thing that i i visited that you know is quite a tourist spot is Cancun Mexico
 	
 	
 		ooh that would be nice
 	
 	
 		and that was real nice uh
 	
 	
 		did you scuba dive there
 	
 	
 		uh no we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there
 	
 	
 		ooh that would be nice
 	
 	
 		yeah and just kind of relaxed and
 		unwound a little bit from our daily routine
 	
 	
 		oh that would be enjoyable
 		right yeah that's a nice break i haven't been on vacation in a while either um usually when we go we go to Colorado to Estes Park area which is up kind of near Denver
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the Texas heat that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		oh that's always refreshing to get away from
 	
 	
 		so it's a lot of fun i worked up there last summer so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the whole summer long
 	
 	
 		oh well that's nice yeah
 	
 	
 		worked at a camp there and so i got to
 		spend a lot of time up in the mountains
 		so that's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere
 		on a vacation
 	
 	
 		well my uh my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity and that's canoeing
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh they've been to the Guadalupe River and they also uh
 		uh have been to uh i guess Colorado and they've really enjoyed it it's a whole new
 	
 	
 		that's nice we um we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's the best place that i've ever canoed it was really
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		really pretty i was a little kid then and we to have uh we stayed at some park and they had a little uh mountain man who came down the river every night and he would give a little talk about
 		
 
 		mountain things you know i think he wasn't a real mountain man but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in
 	
 	
 		sure
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the woods that he'd come in his little log boat down the river and we would have to we'd  and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 	
 	
 		that's that's a good family place to go and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		frightening but it wasn't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 		too easy either
 		so it was like
 	
 	
 		well you learn a lot of um skills too and
 		i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older to learn new skills and i think they really it really penetrates penetrates in your memory you know what to do because you really have a great interest in it
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because it's something you weren't forced to do
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning and you're more receptive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good well we um let's see the only other place i've ever vacationed we'd you know go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then i went to England
 	
 	
 		oh that's exciting
 	
 	
 		a few years ago i was a student there and spent um a semester studying abroad in London
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that was a great time because it's so that's such a neat place and it's there's not a language barrier so you don't i mean there
 		there's a little bit because there's some of those English words that you just don't
 		exactly know what they mean and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents but it's
 		it was really fun i i i really enjoyed that i'm probably going back there to work for a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i had a friend that uh visited England not
 		well i think it's been probably two years now but that's her next goal and she can do it is go back to England because she really
 		has a great desire to do that because the love that she um has for it now after visiting it
 	
 	
 		it it's really nice i would i would spend all my time in London or most of my time and that's it was really different being in a big city because i don't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		get much into  urban you know really urban areas a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it was it's really it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you could just kind of
 	
 	
 		do your own thing
 	
 	
 		kind of walk around and observe i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching watching people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i had a great time doing that
 		it was really interesting
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 		there's a lot out there to see i'll say
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i  keep wanting to get up to i haven't i haven't been anywhere else outside the United States i haven't been to Mexico or Canada
 		or
 	
 	
 		well i lived across the street almost from Canada
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that was that that's a nice place Canada is very nice
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be nice i had a friend from there then i i'd love to go somewhere in Asia but i'd have to have a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		tour guide with me to
 	
 	
 		oh yes absolutely
 	
 	
 		help with all the language and all that
 	
 	
 		sure somebody that knows their way around
 	
 	
 		so yeah that's why that's why England was nice even we traveled in Europe for about a week and that was even nice because there wasn't uh the most the places we went we went to Germany and Switzerland and
 	
 	
 		well you've been quite a few places there
 	
 	
 		well i yeah we  have we just kind of
 	
 	
 		
 
 		once you think about it huh
 	
 	
 		we did we whirlwinded through Europe it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day and you slept on the train at night
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		but there wasn't a it was strange it was kind of sad there wasn't ever a language problem there because everyone in Germany knew English and everyone in Switzerland knew English
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		so  we were kind of pitiful we found one restaurant we were in and got seated and then no on e knew English in there and we were just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things but it was uh
 	
 	
 		what did you wind up with
 	
 	
 		oh i had fondue that was easy to say
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		
  
 		tried to get fondue and white wine and that was
 	
 	
 		uh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we were able to have that pretty pretty effortlessly there were some people at the next table who spoke English so we
 	
 	
 		they kind of guided you
 	
 	
 		elicited their aid for a while and they were
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		very helpful so
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		it was
 		it was a pleasant time i'd i'd love to go back there
 		there's just not time
 		there's not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything
 	
 	
 		i guess that's why we need to plan for retirement so when we do have the free time we'll have the the means to uh pursue our dreams
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess that's what retirement is all about
 	
 	
 		that's
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that and sleeping late
 	
 	
 		Yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i keep hoping for
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh i understand that huh
 	
 	
 		well
 		it was nice talking with you
 	
 	
 		well it was nice talking with you too Craig
 	
 	
 		and have a good afternoon
 	
 	
 		you do the same thank you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay
 		good-bye
