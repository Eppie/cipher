 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right well i'll just start by saying that we we spend our time you know having a formal dinner on on the weekend and that's when we try and get together it might be breakfast it might be and we try and talk about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		things and we try we have dinner every night too but not everybody is always there our daughters are fifteen seventeen and twenty
 	
 	
 		how old are they
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		are they all living at home
 	
 	
 		they are at home um our oldest daughter is going to be a senior at SMU
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so she's home for summer school and living at home um right now and we we but we very rarely do things as a whole family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well when they were little though you did didn't you
 	
 	
 		yes yes we used to like
 	
 	
 		yeah because they're all close enough in age that you would have had to take them all
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah we we used to like to go to oh parades the circus um
 		you know we used to like to take them to the park um we had a we have a swimming pool at our house which we've had since they were very small
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		so we we have many memories of swimming um together in the afternoons you know and by the pool and the girls uh learned to swim when they were real little you know three and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and then they had their parties there and all that
 	
 	
 		yes they had their their pool parties um
 		so that was one of the things we did together was the most uh i guess the most often was swim by the swim in the pool that's
 	
 	
 		yeah well see i mean you know since we haven't had our children yet but um
 		the thing that my husband and i do could very easily be incorporated with children because we like to go camping and we like to we have a boat so we go in the boat all the time and so
 	
 	
 		oh that's great if you like to do those two things
 	
 	
 		yeah and so you know those things could children could very easily go you know and just go with the flow
 	
 	
 		very easily yes
 		yes i think you will enjoy that i we never camped and we
 		we aren't we aren't into boating either uh mainly because my husband doesn't like boats that much and he uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's mainly what i you know what he wanted to do and and he's a swimmer he's a golfer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		did he teach them how to play golf
 	
 	
 		well he has taken them out on the golf course but he hasn't and they've never showed any any any real interest it's got not enough action for for the children you know so um but we we like to um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but now you know now next weekend we're taking them to a show we're taking them down to Fair Park to see Chorus Line
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and that's kind of their reward for a school year successful school year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's a great one
 	
 	
 		so we're we're doing that
 	
 	
 		well that will be fun
 	
 	
 		but um but i you know as far as having a family it sounds like you've got some good ideas
 	
 	
 		yeah it's
 	
 	
 		how about your families are they close by your immediate your um
 	
 	
 		uh my parents are in Oklahoma and i have my oldest sister lives there with her two kids and these are the only grandchildren at this point so they're getting tons of attention but um they're a lot of fun and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my nephew's in to tee ball and so they spend a lot of time but they're in this little bitty small hole in the road town so you know they have a lot of time that they can spend with their kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes that's nice
 	
 	
 		and that's you know that was another question that my husband and i had is that what we have four dogs and we barely have time to play with them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		four dogs well that's
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah those are my children right now
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's i think that's a bridge that everybody uses to get used to taking the responsibility of caring for something and then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it was real funny because we were walking out of a store one morning and he turned to me and he said did you feed the kids this morning and i said no didn't you and this lady looked at us like we were child abusers and  so we had to explain to her we were talking about our dog
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's great yeah that's cute because i know our dog i didn't think he got fed this morning but our our daughter fed him because we have we have two daughters that are away right now they're at a camp
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh uh not a camp they're on a choir tour that's were they are so they're they're gone so it's just me and our older daughter here this week but um but you will um i i think that's neat that you're going to start a family and and um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		yeah it's
 	
 	
 		and and i know everybody around you your family will be very supportive and very anxious too i'm sure
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they they
 	
 	
 		i i have to tell you that um grandparents are very important to have close by i think and ours were never close by
 	
 	
 		oh i know it
 		really well see mine since like i said my family my my parents started out so late having us my grandparents all but one was already dead even when before i was born so i didn't get to have that but
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 	
 	
 		i had aunts and uncles that were so close to me that you know replaced grandparents i think in every way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah so how old is your little
 	
 	
 		so it's really neat that i can do that now with my niece and nephew
 	
 	
 		well how old are your parents now then
 	
 	
 		um my mother's seventy five and my dad's seventy three
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well that's exactly how old my parents are
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and um but but they are the reversed my dad's seventy five my mom's seventy well actually my mom's seventy two my dad
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well they're a lot of fun now
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm sure i'm sure they are
 	
 	
 		but also it was neat too because
 		um there was so much age difference between my sisters and me that i was kind of like the only child and so mother and i did tons of things together we i mean she didn't drive but she'd load me up on a bus and we'd go across country and just had the best time
 	
 	
 		yes
 		isn't that wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah it was really neat so we were really close but that's
 	
 	
 		oh you must have such great memories of that
 	
 	
 		oh i do it's really neat yeah because it was real funny because in high school all my friends were fighting with their mothers  and i wasn't i was having a ball i mean on spring break that
 	
 	
 		that is so good
 		isn't that
 		that's really interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah on spring break i'd go with mother to the horse races and all my friends would go to Padre Island
 	
 	
 		oh that is great i because that's very that's rare
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it was so much fun
 	
 	
 		yeah because i was the i'm the oldest of four and we had a we have a very close knit family and i i just i am just very blessed
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but being the oldest i had you know the responsibility of of doing a lot i have two younger brothers and a sister a younger sister so um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh well see that's another thing that scares me about having kids because i was the baby so i haven't even really been around kids
 	
 	
 		yes yes well you'll well you have your niece your nephew and to to look at that and and learn from that and you can read lots of good books
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but um but that's real fun so and you're in Carrollton yeah and where what what church do you go to do you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		we're Methodist
 	
 	
 		oh good yeah so are we
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah so
 	
 	
 		yeah we've been in Plano for thirteen years
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh our kids have grown up here and i think i think Plano
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think the fact that you have the boating and the camping is a good good thing i think it's hard for parents to find things to do with their kids once the sports aren't there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 		well
 	
 	
 		you know anymore like we have we always have the baseball games to go to that the kids are in and the you know tee ball soccer stuff like that but uh after they as they get older it's harder to find things to do together
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah well we have all i mean and i both have camped since we were little with our parents and so i think it's very natural and i'm sure that's the way it will be and oh we've already looked in the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		catalog to to find a little baby ski jacket
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well where do you go camping
 	
 	
 		um we go to Lake Whitney a lot which is it's a beautiful lake and then we go to Arkansas
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well i was just down near there i i had to drive to Austin last week and on Thursday last Thursday as a matter of fact my i saw the sign
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i didn't know it was pretty i just i
 	
 	
 		oh it's a very pretty lake
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's real clear which is kind of unusual for Texas lakes
 	
 	
 		yeah and they have campgrounds
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they have some great camp grounds and then we like to go to Arkansas too because that's where i camped when i was little and there's some beautiful lakes there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah well that's interesting i am not timing this conversation because i guess you're supposed to be in control it says
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 		well yeah but i just kind of keep talking until we quit
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well this is my first call so um yeah yeah i i enjoy uh this is really going to be a neat thing i think
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah
 		yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		but um  i it's it's i think i'm going to need a pencil you know to to jot down what they say in the beginning and that because it's hard they're it's like
