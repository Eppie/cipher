 		hi
 	
 	
 		hi
 	
 	
 		uh
 		books uh i've actually i am reading a couple of different books uh uh
 		one was uh is uh
 		a story well it is not a story it is a collection of um
 		of memos supposedly written by Howard Hughes uh that was uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that was  it came out a couple of years ago and i have just now gotten around to reading it i have had it a couple years but uh just just
 	
 	
 		who wrote that
 	
 	
 		oh i do not remember the man's name he was used to be a reporter for uh i think the New York Time or the Washington Post one of the two and he supposedly got this this  story uh i mean this uh
 		was contacted by this guy who had these these memos he wanted to sell and they were they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the um corporate headquarters in um in Los Angeles um
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they on i think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something there in Los Angeles they used to have a or i guess they still do uh had a uh
 		uh big warehouse kind of thing which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a
 		you know for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected he he was uh a great collector of everything he he
 		he didn't he didn't throw anything away and uh supposedly this guy had had been breaking there for awhile he was a like you know burglar had been breaking there awhile and uh and had ended up
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		he he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect and they uh they broke in one one night and found a bunch of memos that were uh supposedly from
 		from Hughes to uh to his main um
 		main assistant assistant assistant assistant back uh in the fifties and sixties well i guess in the sixties up until his death
 	
 	
 		well that is interesting
 		all right
 	
 	
 		so it's pretty interesting work so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a it's a little
 		it's a little hard it's a it's a you have to plod through it and you know it doesn't doesn't have a real story or any plot you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and they haven't made a movie of the week of it yet
 	
 	
 		no i have not seen it but it's but it is it is real interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i also reading uh the uh  it's a an old another old book that i happen to have i am sort of rereading it it's um
 		a book about uh the Bermuda Triangle but it's uh it's about it's a real good book that a guy um wrote who was uh a research librarian he wrote um sort of
 		debunking many of the uh uh um
 		the stories about the uh Bermuda Triangle you know he he was saying many many of the
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		the myths many of the myths of the triangle were uh actually could be explained and and you know
 	
 	
 		explained like
 	
 	
 		uh and the reason reason i was i hadn't picked it back up was in light of all the uh
 		the  well when they found the uh the airplanes out in the Atlantic thinking they were Flight Nineteen and i don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's uh Flight Nineteen was one of the uh
 		a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two Right after World War Two and they were they were lost and uh so
 	
 	
 		supposedly scooped up by the triangle yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah they were and so and in the book you know even  he wrote this book back in the seventies and even and even then he
 		he made had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water and uh because he he
 		he mentions he he goes through and and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth and uh it's probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and couldn't find their way back
 	
 	
 		yeah on that same topic have you ever read anything about you know the Amelia Earhart story whatever happened with her
 	
 	
 		uh no i haven't
 	
 	
 		i i think that would be i am sure there is something out there uh that might a
 	
 	
 		yeah i would i would like to too because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her you know possibilities of her of where she have might have been
 	
 	
 		i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years well whatever this is one aspect of it of course you know it is so weird cause no one will ever really know it's it the
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things that is for sure
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah so that is pretty much for right now that is what i have been reading i i kind of like to read different stuff and uh i like to read a novel every now and then but um i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right well i i guess i just have not read anything i mean usually i just if i find a good book i will sit you know for two days until it is finished if it's that good and i think the last one i read like that was Scott Thurow's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that was Presumed Innocent
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and i just really really liked the way he writes it's just
 	
 	
 		yeah i read that too i got it um right after it came out my uh
 	
 	
 		incredible
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know he was an an assistant district attorney in Chicago at uh and while he was writing the book and uh
 		my sister-in-law lives in Chicago and she had before it actually got big she sent me this book saying you might like this this guy is you know from here and
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh i i read it and really liked it and then about that is when it really got big and uh so i
 	
 	
 		that was good i think and and the other book i am trying to think you know like was in the last year and i think i did read Tom Wolfe and uh Vanity you know Bon yeah
 	
 	
 		i haven't read that although i have heard it is pretty good
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah i that was really really good the movie was nothing compared to the book and yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that is what i have heard i saw the movie and
 	
 	
 		oh the movie was a joke  compared to i mean because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive when it comes to you know pinpointing um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		society's society's society's society's ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things and
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh it was it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		and anyway we are not talking about that but um gee i just i like to read gardening books and things like that just to tell me what to do with my garden and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i have a lot of  computer books because i am i do computer work and so i have a lot of those so i spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but uh looking through them so i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		interested in a lot of that but uh i have got a lot of books that i i intend to read but i have not been able to yet you know for one reason or another
 	
 	
 		like what is a book on your list you know i have a list too and  i have never gotten to it
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i don't i don't really have a list because i just kind of uh i just have all the books out you know i have book shelves and i have them all out and usually when i am through with one i will go in and uh uh
 		look look through uh i have one now and i i can't remember the name of it that i that i got is the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or or Christmas or something will send me another another good book and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh shit i have one and i can not remember the name of it uh it is supposed to be a mystery
