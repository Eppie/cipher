 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah yes i talked with um i talked with people from Richardson and Plano and uh the first three days and then yesterday i talked with someone with from Pennsylvania so it's the
 	
 	
 		yeah because i've only been made this is only my third call i i tried to make calls two different days and i couldn't get through
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh i know sometimes i just i'm in it just takes a very long time so
 	
 	
 		does it yeah i've been trying to you know do that and and sometimes i just can't wait that long so i just hang up because it keeps going through the thing over and over again
 	
 	
 		yeah i know well
 		this is hilarious  oh well tell me what books have you read lately
 	
 	
 		but i knew as soon as i heard your voice i thought Kathy's it's Kathy Kenser  well
 		well let's see i um  gosh i can't even think i haven't read any and you're such a reader i know that and i
 	
 	
 		well i don't read all that much for enjoyment i mean i read a lot for school but gee i just don't have much time for enjoyment reading
 	
 	
 		yeah the the last book i picked up was a book by Judy Bloom and it was um it was called um  Smart Women i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		um or something like that and it was it was kind of i really didn't like it at all it was it was written back in the early eighties and it was all this this um divorced woman syndrome of the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um it was almost like a a pre AIDS scare kind of thing
 	
 	
 		interesting
 	
 	
 		it was really an interesting because i i right away looked at when it was copyrighted
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because i could tell by the theme of almost when it was written
 	
 	
 		yes yes yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was all about women searching for themselves
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 		you know a lot of  hanky-panky going on
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that kind of was um kind of a pop psychology time for when when a lot of books like that were coming out i think
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and so that makes real sense that that's um when it was written um i haven't wasn't really aware that she had written anything for um adults i was always just more aware of her journal you know for her young people her books uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah and she's more famous for that but she has been writing
 		for adults also and so i thought hey i'll just try this you know and see what it was like it was very um  the style was very conversational
 	
 	
 		i'll be darned
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know how that is and and um
 	
 	
 		yeah i wonder if she's written anything really recently if she's got anything printed in print
 	
 	
 		yeah she has because i i remember seeing a new book by her that was out and i think it was a it was an adult book
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i'll be darned
 	
 	
 		so anyway but that's the last thing i i've read and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well it's i'm trying to think the last actual book i read that wasn't let's see i think i read oh when i was on vacation um between semester break and summer and you know on semester break between spring and summer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i went to my mother's i read a book that i have should have read when i was probably in high school i read um Jane Eyre  no wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute Jane Eyre no no no no it wasn't Jane Eyre no it was um
 	
 	
 		i
 		Wuthering Heights
 	
 	
 		uh Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen that's what it was yes and um you know i i didn't know what to expect except i had heard that that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah by Jane Austen yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		she really was good i mean i was was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know i just but i as i say i was pretty much ashamed that i hadn't read something before then
 	
 	
 		yeah because i i think i was i think i read it in college or had to write it read it in high school or college but i don't remember it and then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg and i got her the i got her someone i think it was um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh some actress reading it you know they had an abridged version of it on tape and so i got that for her and she loved doing that but i remember that was the book
 	
 	
 		oh how interesting
 		yes
 		oh i'll bet yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and now i i mean i think it's around here somewhere i'm just going to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right i wouldn't be surprised yeah
 		sure oh yeah well i read that and then i'm trying to think um usually i try to to find something long that i'm going to do
 	
 	
 		but um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when if if i have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when i know i'm not going to be doing anything for a while um
 	
 	
 		yeah oh that's what i do too
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's about it because otherwise i'm reading so much for school i'm um i have just started reading a book actually it's for school but it's for um there's a a literary journal well not a literary journal it's a
 		it's kind of a journal of of the history of ideas that's that's starting to be published um from UTD the first issue doesn't come out until next year but um i'm doing some reviews of books just to
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		what to sort of recommend to whether whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal and i've yeah it's really neat because these are brand new books and i just got a i got a this this one
 	
 	
 		oh how neat
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		um most of the stuff is on uh literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that this one is on Johann Sebastian Bach and it's a a biography a biography
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		that is really interesting i mean it it's fascinating it really is um but it's so long i i don't really have the time to read the whole thing but i think eventually i'll go back to it but it
 	
 	
 		oh that's fascinating oh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was written i mean the the copyright is nineteen ninety one so it's a brand new book yeah uh-huh yeah and he really this man really shed some light on um
 	
 	
 		oh it's a brand new book oh that that would be wonderful to read something like that
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some aspects of of Bach's genius and and and you know the and more sociological things you know like the the idea that um
 		that music to be a musician was as much um of a family occupation as anything i mean you know that was it was families had just loads of musicians  yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah and they just went from generation probably to generation just with these with these all passing it from one to the other
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh and um
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the way it was i'm sure back then yeah oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so um it was just really interesting if that's
 		you know that's kind of what but i have to not only am am i reading reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisors for this um journal doesn't have right now doesn't have a really respected name um who's a
 		um a scholar on on music um and i'm supposed to decide whether i think this man might be a worthy person to be a you know in that position on the board so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know if i want to take that responsibility or not but  but at least i can tell them what i think so um it's real interesting
 	
 	
 		wow that's rough that's real rough
 		yeah well that's a neat thing to be involved in because i think our i think my alma mater um Gettysburg i think they were just starting a magazine
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that was similar to that i think that's probably a sort of a thing to do in small colleges but um
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yes
 		yeah that it you know you see you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that right uh-huh because it attracts really a a lot people's interest that's one way it's really good public relations for small schools i think so
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		oh yes yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh another one of my projects this summer is actually it's part of my research assistantship is um it's helping a professor uh compile a bunch of translations of of various poems for a book that he's writing
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i'm learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people
 	
 	
 		now translations what do you mean translations of of
 	
 	
 		um well where where for instance um a Baudelaire poem that was written in the French and then has been translated into English by various people and the translations are all so different from one another um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		oh i see
 		all different
 		oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		so it's multiple translations of single works and and that's right now right now pretty much what i'm doing as far as um my work is just kind of compiling all that for him so
 	
 	
 		gosh
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		it's real interesting
 	
 	
 		boy you really lift me up to a different i mean here i i'm dealing with uh cleaning the stove and you know i'm  i wish i were dealing with Baudelaire  that would be nice  but i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well let me tell you there are days when i would be prefer really doing that  i don't know if i've told you but um this is not on the subject
