 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so where was your last vacation
 	
 	
 		uh actually my last vacation was in Connecticut um we went home to visit family before that we were in Hawaii
 	
 	
 		oh i i'd well actually i did visit Hawaii once but i never made it off of Oahu which i've heard is not the nicest of the islands
 	
 	
 		oh
 		it wasn't actually it when when we were in Oahu Oahu uh
 		i couldn't wait to get off  we we took a cruise and we went to four different islands and it was a really nice Kauai was nice and Maui was nice we had we had a great time we were there for ten days
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's wow yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yes so where have you been
 	
 	
 		oh i've been  i've been lots of places my last vacation was actually in Morocco i guess we that one would count uh that was about a year and a half ago and
 	
 	
 		Morocco really
 		no kidding and what what did you just decide to go there or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well my husband is French and we were living in France at the time and we decided that i i've never been to Africa and i needed to get that continent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hadn't been there yet and it it's actually it's a fairly common vacation place for
 		for French people to go and they speak French and so uh you know in that sense is just a little bit easier and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah oh i'm sure it was wonderful
 	
 	
 		so we we didn't really have enough time we had about a little bit less than two weeks and as always it don't it seems a bit uh rushed we do a lot of traveling around we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		was it hot
 	
 	
 		no in fact some of the days we froze it was well we were there in the winter in January uh January or February i don't remember which uh-huh
 	
 	
 		really
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh i was born in Saudi Arabia and uh when my father worked there we they used to travel quite a bit all around you know in in Europe and whatnot but i was very young so i don't remember that and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		at what at  excuse me at what age did you
 	
 	
 		i was three when we moved back here so i don't remember but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been  and that i was when i was a baby but so Morocco i think would be wonderful because that's you know that's
 	
 	
 		oh that's too bad because
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that area of the world i think would be great
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a very interesting vacation the only thing i didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide and you there were some places where people definite there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in you know in jacket underneath a coat type of thing but
 	
 	
 		really we we found that in Jamaica it was the same way that people would come up and try and sell you well try and sell drugs and things like that but they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they were so destitute and i guess they they make all their money on tourism and and they would come up and ask you
 		you know if if you want to buy different things and really after awhile it really gets annoying you know it it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the the worst place was in Marrakech
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it doesn't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you and it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		really
 	
 	
 		and you feel stupid doing that but we did it and we were much happier and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		well that's great where else have you been
 	
 	
 		uh  yes no actually i haven't been all through Europe like i haven't been to Italy yet uh we're going to go for a conference in September and so
 	
 	
 		well you lived in France so you've been all through Europe no
 		really
 	
 	
 		hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too uh my more exciting spots have been i've been to the Galapagos Islands
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that was one of the most wonderful vacations i've ever had yes if you like wildlife it's a fabulous vacation
 	
 	
 		lots of wildlife huh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest  but it that was really really fabulous and just the photos i have of it and gosh incredible and be so close um August eighty eight
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now when was that when were you there
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then actually after there i went to um Hawaii a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i went to Hawaii and then to Australia
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and Japan and China
 	
 	
 		did you go on the Barrier Reef did you see the Great Barrier Reef and and go snorkeling
 	
 	
 		i i actually i didn't go diving i i'm a diver and so that's that's actually been another of my
 	
 	
 		oh diving
 	
 	
 		favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh no i didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef i drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Adelaide Adelaide it's gorgeous absolutely gorgeous the coastline was just incredible it's huge
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is it really yeah yeah did you have shrimp i've seen in you know they they show all this wonderful seafood and and great big prawns you know the big shrimp and
 	
 	
 		Australia yeah uh but
 		i don't remember if i had shrimp
 	
 	
 		no didn't have shrimp there huh  i remember food
 	
 	
 		i don't think so
 		oh i like that too but uh in fact i didn't eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car it would have been i think much more fun to do it like in the van with a bunch of people but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh oh you're adventurous you went by yourself really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and i was by myself in China too yeah
 	
 	
 		really oh wow
 	
 	
 		China was a little bit more uh of a challenge but it it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time and so i never you know got out by myself or not much
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh was it very expensive
 	
 	
 		no actually i paid about
 		either a thousand dollars or a little bit
 		no maybe it was about a thousand dollars maybe a little bit less i don't really remember for ten days including all my meals a guide a car the airfare and sorry but this is from Hong Kong
 	
 	
 		you're kidding no kidding uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because i was already in Hong Kong and um but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and i went to Beijing
 		Shanghai Chengdu and actually then i too k a train up from Shanghai to a little Quingdao i think is the name of it it's a little
 		uh sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai it's just a train ride and that i had two internal one yeah two internal plane flights
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a couple of other things
 	
 	
 		all for a thousand dollars wow that really surprises me i guess i relate it to to Japan where things are very expensive aren't they yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh Japan Japan's ridiculous
 		and i stayed i didn't stay in t he top of the line hotels but i stayed in they were all completely clean and you know they were newly built and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line hotels because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah and you don't want to stay in the very very very exclusive because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're yeah yeah wow
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		uh but yeah that was that i highly recommend that way to go if you're ever interested in going the route i dealt with this woman her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah um and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun i think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a guide and then
