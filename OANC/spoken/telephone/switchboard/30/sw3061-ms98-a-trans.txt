 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh well right now we have one dog inside
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she goes out but i mean she's an indoor dog
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and two outside cats
 	
 	
 		oh gosh and how long have you had them
 	
 	
 		male and female
 		the male the dog is probably about about thirteen fourteen years old and the cats are
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		they might be as old i'm not sure  yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of lose track  well that's interesting because we have a similar we don't have cats but we do have a dog who is an indoor dog and she is going to be thirteen this summer so yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh is that right what kind of dog do you have
 	
 	
 		um she's um a mix of Cockapoo Cocker Cocker Spaniel and Poodle
 	
 	
 		oh that's what ours is  yes
 	
 	
 		is that right isn't that interesting  what color is your dog
 	
 	
 		white
 	
 	
 		oh  well ours is black so  definitely different  yes she's a female and she's um been she's been a really a really good companion for me um she's like a little shadow you know kind of follows me around all the time and
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh i'll be darned
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um she's slowing down considerably she doesn't hear very well and she doesn't see very well but she's yeah at this age i guess so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that's to be expected at their age
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um she's been a good dog to have and i don't know once she's gone i'm not sure if i'll get another animal or not
 	
 	
 		well everybody always says no more  but i i think animals are really important in the family i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i agree yes um did you get yours as a pet for your children do you have children uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh yeah we have five ah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh well i was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before or
 	
 	
 		well we have had we had had a a dog before she was fifteen when she died and uh this one we bought by accident a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to come or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 		uh
 	
 	
 		puppy that somebody people drop things like that off up there and i said gee she sounds like a cute little dog i told the kids let's go look at her
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		go get her so that's how we got her quite by accident
 	
 	
 		isn't that
 		yes so that often happens that way well we had um intentionally um planned to get a dog we had just moved into this house and um decided to wait a about a year and then went then we went out then and found one she was in the litter and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she was so cute because  all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy i mean they were all over the place and she was real docile and came over and just kind of sat next to us and i thought that's the dog for me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh
 		oh she picked us
 	
 	
 		yeah so she and it what was funny was that um our daughter must have been let's see she must have been about eight at the time i guess and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she just loved this little dog to pieces but i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her i think she was always a little bit leery of her
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was um not very interested in pets but as it turned out he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals
 	
 	
 		oh for heaven's sake
 	
 	
 		so you just never know how that works out
 	
 	
 		no but they say it's real important for children to have pets because uh well they can go and talk to them any time they want to and tell them anything they want to and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		nobody is going to you know reprimand them or know their secrets or
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that yes they're very unjudgmental  oh dear
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes
 		and the nursing homes now they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home
 	
 	
 		yes i have been i have been reading and seeing about that on television uh-huh and how
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		our one our one nursing home in Brooksville has one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		permanent
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		he he kind of has free run of the place and there is somebody or somebody takes care of him
 	
 	
 		isn't that amazing
 	
 	
 		but he goes up and down the halls visiting people and real nice dog uh and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes it's funny how um how pets can kind of um oh take on a certain status in certain areas i mean um that made me think of uh when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in um Saint Louis and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um there were several dogs on the campus and and the what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly but they didn't appear to belong to anyone and um i'm sure someone you know fed them they were healthy looking dogs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um our guide that day said that the lady one woman many many years ago had given a huge sum of money to to the university on the condition that there be um dogs just kind of left to roam around around the campus
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		which is the strangest thing i had ever heard
 	
 	
 		yeah because most campuses don't allow pets you know they just do not allow them
 	
 	
 		i know
 		yes i know it
 	
 	
 		that's that's kind of great
 	
 	
 		yes it really was it was just a nice touch and it kind of made it seem more homy too  but um the i thought that was most unique and it just you know kind of goes along with what you were saying about the dog having sort of free run of the the nursing home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um but uh i this is the only pet we've had since you know in all our years of marriage um and it's been uh sort of a a change for my husband because as a a a boy growing up
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		his father had dogs but they were always hunting dogs and so they were never allowed in the house you know they were always kind of yeah right  that's what he said yes so having a pet was a little bit different for him
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh yeah we've ruined them  they say they'll ruined them
 		well we've had a lot of different pets we had
 		the kids had rabbits for pets and we also raised them for food at one time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah oh yes
 	
 	
 		and we've had it we've had a skunk for a pet
 	
 	
 		oh my golly
 	
 	
 		for more years than i want to think about  she was in the house
 	
 	
 		oh gosh isn't that interesting i don't think i've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet  oh
 	
 	
 		well don't don't ever get one for a pet  they're okay but like she uh they don't ever learn their name
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		uh you can't you could never call her and she would come to you you had to go chas e her down
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'll be darned how interesting
 	
 	
 		and uh their eyesight they can't see very far either but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i guess i've heard that uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they they before before we got her everybody said oh they're just like a cat you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh they're not  i mean they use the litter box that's about it as far as
 	
 	
 		
 
 		isn't that interesting that's that's really something um how long did you have that
 	
 	
 		oh my how how long
 		probably seven or eight years
 	
 	
 		goodness sake
 	
 	
 		and finally my children are the ones who said mom you've put up with that skunk long enough so  we moved her to the basement and i don't think she was there a week till the men moved
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		built built her a pen outside  and i thought i put up with that all those years
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh Isn't that funny
 		yes and this is what it took finally  that is
 	
 	
 		and we've had we've had cats two stay in the house we had we had two Siamese cats
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		different times
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh one of them ran off she ran off once or he i guess it was a male he ran off twice and the second time he never came back
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		and we would see him uh several miles from our house he kind of moved into a woods down there and he got huge down there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i'll be
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		he really grew but he he never came back
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 		that's interesting i i wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat
 	
 	
 		well he wasn't a whole lot he was in the house most the time but uh he did go out sometimes and uh they make it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah the the cats my son has a cat and the vet had told us they get strange if they're kept in the house all the time and their cat uh was not a friendly cat it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well
 	
 	
 		it was not a good
 		i don't know it got it was just did get strange  and since they've moved to where they are they let the cat out and it has improved the personality
 	
 	
 		yeah so that that was right
 		uh-huh
