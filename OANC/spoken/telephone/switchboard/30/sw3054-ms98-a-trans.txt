 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		wow i don't know what that was i don't know
 	
 	
 		what what was that
 		and uh to um
 		
 
 		the Brazos River near Dinosaur Valley State Park
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yes uh-huh um the we have not camped in any of those places in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped but we used to go to Tyler State Park and um to Dangerfield and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in Texas that is where we camped basically um
 	
 	
 		what are they like
 	
 	
 		they're very nice Tyler is really really a neat place to camp it has a nice a nice little lake and it has some really wonderful uh sights that are in the the wooded areas
 		um the facilities are quite nice and our children like liked it quite well uh the kids are
 		well they were quite a bit younger then and uh you know it they we felt real um safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area and uh it was just it was a really nice place to to camp
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um now Dangerfield is let's see i think that's a little bit more more east further east
 		and maybe south if i am remembering where that is no i think it's a little bit further north when i think about it at any rate it was it was very nice as well but Tyler we sort of got spoiled with i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh we had lived in Michigan before we came here and um had done a lot of camping in Michigan i think the upper peninsula of Michigan especially and then also we had done some camping in Colorado in the mountains so uh
 		my parents were real avid campers  and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well so i guess we just kind of came by it naturally
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		do you um have a large tent or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it was a a nine by twelve uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and how how many does that sleep uh comfortably
 	
 	
 		well there well supposedly it it's they always say it sleeps more than it does
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it they it would have slept three adults anyway yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger uh we invested in some stacking um cots you know that were like bunk bunk beds but they were cots fold up cots that really gave us a lot more space um floor space and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you didn't have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around and uh gave us a place to stack things during the day so that was real nice
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh we um
 		my my uh uh in-laws also had a camper um pop up tent tent you know one of those trailer pop ups and those are really nice too and the little more uh luxurious so to speak but not much
 	
 	
 		do do they have a kitchen in them
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh it's really nice in fact it even have a had a little refrigerator and and the whole business it was quite nice in that respect and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		uh everything was very convenient and you didn't have to to be hauling things out of your the trunk of you car so that was nice yeah
 	
 	
 		trunk of your car all time right
 	
 	
 		so um do you have plans for for any other camping trips in the near future
 	
 	
 		oh maybe uh maybe back to Caddo or um uh Purdis Creek
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		or uh i like Bob Sandlin too it's a new park
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there is um not really camping but
 		
 
 		um
 		what's it called Cedar Hill
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		by Joe Pool
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and sometime i like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma
 	
 	
 		yes yes i've been in that area that's a really pretty state park um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just we didn't camp there but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area and it's just real lovely it's close to the lake and close to the dam i think it's close to the dam up there so it's it's really quite pretty
 		uh are you um let's see what was i was going to ask you something else oh do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to
 	
 	
 		oh from from those three just just uh from when i have been an adult i like Caddo the best
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		is uh is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		i i would i've never been there and i would love to see what it looks like
 	
 	
 		it's not it's not very deep and they did build a dam on it but it was there before they built the dam it's been there for a hundred years apparently an earth quake caused it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i see
 		how interesting i guess i'd never heard the history of that huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that might be some place where we my husband and i can go we're talking about starting camping again in the fall
 		um our children are both grown and and so it's just pretty much the two of us who do things and so uh we thought we might take some weekend trips then and maybe that would be a good place to to go to and see what it looks like
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really nice
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and it i don't know probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas yeah
 	
 	
 		is it uh yeah i think so especially with uh uh when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty especially in east Texas it's really nice so
 	
 	
 		that's right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well uh  i've enjoyed talking with you
 	
 	
 		it's nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		and um have uh uh some happy camping trips  hope you get to those places you've talked about
 	
 	
 		yeah you too
 	
 	
 		well okay thanks uh-huh bye bye
 	
 	
 		bye bye
