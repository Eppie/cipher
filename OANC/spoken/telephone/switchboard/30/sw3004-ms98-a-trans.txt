 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so well she lives in Utah so
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh uh-huh that's the way we always were we always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		well i guess we're going to talk about children today
 	
 	
 		okay let's do it
 	
 	
 		so you ready
 		
 
 		my children are all
 		gone already they're they're all out on their own
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh do you want to start first do you you uh do you work
 	
 	
 		okay
 		no i don't i stay home most of the time but i know that it's very difficult to to find good help sometimes when and especially when your when you want your children to be taken care of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		um you know there's a my neighbor she tends children though and and um there's a big controversy whether they should have to um have a a law
 		a law to have them certified or or not and um
 		you know there's pros and cons on both side of that because if they were then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing or some kind of something to be okay okay get an okay seal
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 		yeah but yet most of the problems we hear of course maybe that's what we hear about is from organized approved day care centers
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		but maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be you know the individual incidence or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum uh now usually when i have someone tend um my oldest tends for me now if i go somewhere but before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh how old is your oldest
 	
 	
 		he's almost a teenager  yeah he's he's very good um but um
 	
 	
 		oh well he's plenty big enough then
 	
 	
 		before that i would i would use uh kids from our church and they did a good job for me um
 	
 	
 		um-hum um
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i've never had to leave them like in a day care center or anything and i've been very lucky just be able to stay home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's the way with me i i worked four years one time but but my last two children were uh both entering high school age
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they were of course gone while i was working working so
 		it wasn't a problem i saw and i stayed home the rest of the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i so i didn't have that problem either
 		now i have my my oldest daughter she has two children and they've been in day care
 		uh she works full time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's hard
 	
 	
 		it it's difficult but yet she's the type of person that i don't know if she'd be happy staying at home
 	
 	
 		well some people aren't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh she uh she surprised me though she's done a lot of things that i never thought she would do you know with with the family because she
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children  so she uh she spends a lot of quality time i think when she is with with the children
 	
 	
 		oh is that  is that right
 		i think that's really important
 	
 	
 		and uh she they've used the day care most of the time they tried once once they had a lady come in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh she she also had a small child she brought with her and it did not work out uh
 		at all  it she thought it was going to she was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out in the morning but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the the lady called and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble and this baby is the is the most pleasant uh real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually and
 		and she was having problems with her and so she called and said things were okay settled down and was all right
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		well my daughter decided to come and check and things weren't okay
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		her her one son was watching the soapies which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies
 	
 	
 		oh um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		and the babysitter was in the kitchen with her baby
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and so that ended that  episode uh she was most upset over over
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		finding this
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet
 	
 	
 		so uh she they kind of had decided that the day care was better there is uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		more people involved more than one adult they and the age groups are separated and uh
 	
 	
 		well nannies have been an option uh but i know that at day care they have more of a a routine like at uh maybe in um preschool would have where they have lessons and so forth and so on
 	
 	
 		um-hum hum
 		yeah story time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and the this one has been particularly nice it uh
 		it kept track of what they did and they would tell the parents what they did that day you know if they said anything or did anything so it kind of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		kept it
 	
 	
 		gave you an idea of what your child was progressing in or doing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i often i always thought that if you were checking into a day care that you would be good to get references
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying you know if there was a problem they they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was
 	
 	
 		oh i think so because if they were still there you know they might not
 	
 	
 		they might not say anything
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		other than how else how do you judge other than from what others have uh what you see uh the cleanliness and that type of thing
 	
 	
 		you can't really you can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something and usually they aren't at that age
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know um
 	
 	
 		but it would be real difficult to pick you you know to find one and decide
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i know i uh about three years ago i i tended some children
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i i wondered if i would have to be certified or wheth er they'd just bring them and and we got to where well we were just friends and so they said no don't do that we'll just bring them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then if it was a problem then then we'd sit down and talk about it but it never happened to be a problem and and so things worked out okay and their kids played with my kids and it worked out well
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah yeah
 		uh it worked out good i'm going to i've decided i'm going to babysit my two granddaughters
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		since they'll be going back at the end of the month and
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		i'm going to give it a try i i i sell Avon and Stanley products and
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i've got that worked out my husband he's retired so he's going to deliver my products so i'll do my orders and that by phone
 	
 	
 		well that'll be great yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i'll be able to keep that up a little bit but i think i think i'll enjoy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i bet you'll have some great experiences with them
 	
 	
 		doing it yeah i i think i'll enjoy
 		i i guess i kind of miss having a baby around  a kid around or something  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		sure why not
 		and and you know the grandparents uh i always hear it's always fun when you can send them home at the end of the day instead of
 	
 	
 		right that's right  well they do say you enjoy them more uh somebody somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun they'd of had them first
 	
 	
 		well
 		that's right
 		well uh my husband's mother lives right over here and she takes care of them sometimes for me and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and just is a lovely lady and have always appreciated when she's sat with them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah my daughter always said she would not let me babysit because you do hear grandparents complaining
 	
 	
 		and
 		oh  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 		because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they're the ones that complain a lot are the first
