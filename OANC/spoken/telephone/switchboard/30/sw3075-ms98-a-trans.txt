 
     		
 	
 		Lynn do you do you want to start
 	
 	
 		certainly um
 	
 	
 		okay
 		do you want to tell me about some of the vacations you've taken or
 	
 	
 		well i i tend to uh take two kinds of vacations
 		the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sightseeing and things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		which is your favorite
 	
 	
 		oh well i couldn't live without the family vacations but uh my favorite is the the indulgent ones where we go off and and uh see places that have interested me since i was a kid for the most part
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		your your family doesn't live close then
 	
 	
 		uh not anymore they uh they've been in San Diego for the last few years and they're moving to Florida
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and that's one of those things you just have to go once a year
 	
 	
 		yep i understand
 	
 	
 		so uh basically it it sorts out into that and then once about once every three or four years i try to get over to England because i lived there for a while
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		some years back
 	
 	
 		i've only only been there once
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i'd love to go back
 	
 	
 		beautiful  country
 		beautiful country beautiful people
 	
 	
 		it was
 		yeah it we had a great time
 	
 	
 		but uh and i'd real really like to go because um i'm fairly recently married and and my husband has been hearing about these people for years and uh but he's never met them so
 		uh i'd like i'd like to do that but anyway that's that's our typical vacation and uh we enjoy the family vacations but the other ones are very special getaways  and we probably take one of each every year how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well  we we as you do take family vacations uh sometimes one a year
 		and but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons but vacations we really enjoy i think we've been on three cruises
 	
 	
 		oh i've never been on a cruise
 	
 	
 		and we we really love cruises we've gone on Carnival Cruise Lines
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we've gone fairly inexpensive from as most cruises go uh we usually book just a month before it's ready to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we get upgraded last time last two times in fact we had an outside room and it was beautiful
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around it's kind of
 	
 	
 		well what do you do on a cruise i've never been on a cruise
 	
 	
 		oh my God you do everything
 		you i mean you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be you can sit in the sun all day around the pool
 		or you can take part in the games that they have going on they always have bingo they have a casino uh they have a massage parlor they have exercise i mean you can do anything
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and that's just aboard ship and then when the ship docks you get to go sight seeing and shopping and that's quite fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh and where have you been on these cruises
 	
 	
 		uh Nassau San Juan Saint Thomas we've been there twice we went two cruises that hit those islands but with different people we we've gone with friends each time
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and then we went to uh the western Caribbean which is uh Port uh Cancun Cozumel
 	
 	
 		oh the the Mexican coast
 	
 	
 		and Ocho Rios pardon me
 	
 	
 		i the that's all Mexico i think
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh and but it was wonderful so we really like those and uh i guess we just like to go someplace someplace entirely different we've been to a few places in this country we still have a lot to see though
 	
 	
 		where are you from originally
 	
 	
 		we're from Illinois originally
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we've been down in Texas eighteen years and so like you we we always try to make it you know back home to see the relatives we both still have family there
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's fun it brings back a lot of memories
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		uh things are different there though they're uh i don't know it's just entirely different world
 		than this area
 	
 	
 		well i i grew up in Dallas so i mean it's not it's not like i'm going home my my parents retired first to San Diego and they're going now to Florida and so they're going very nice places thank God
 	
 	
 		did you
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know i really came to love San Diego and feel very comfortable there they've been there eight years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i just grab the car and drive everywhere
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		so it it is it is nice but it's not home this is home and um and i've never thought about a cruise it's so funny
 	
 	
 		oh they they they really are we've
 		yeah as i said we've done them three times we'd be going again this this year if circumstances hadn't changed we we'd probably go my husband would you know the minute i said the word he he he's chomping at the bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he kind of likes the casinos a little bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i like all of it and
 	
 	
 		what's the best part from your point of view
 	
 	
 		i like seeing other countries and shopping in other places
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i like shopping i can shop anyplace shop in London and France and wherever now my kids are moving to Toronto so we're going to be able to go up there
 	
 	
 		oh that'll be nice
 	
 	
 		so i'm kind of looking forward to that except i hate to see them go
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		sure well go in don't go in the winter
 	
 	
 		oh that's what everybody says and i i think it's i think i'll try to stay away except my my second grandchild will be born in
 		in the winter in January
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that will be hard to stay away from
 	
 	
 		well there there are exceptions made for special occasions like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer so
 	
 	
 		isn't that the truth uh-huh
 	
 	
 		hum
 		well that sounds wonderful well i i guess i i would contemplate going on a cruise uh oh all circumstances permitting it
 	
 	
 		well there's all age group groups too and that's that's kind of fun uh you if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people you may meet people you know thirty years older than you or younger and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		everybody is really interesting and everybody is there to have a good time and
 	
 	
 		huh how long are the cruises
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh we've only gone on the seven day cruises
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they have shorter ones and then they have ten day ones
 		but i think seven days is long enough for us by that time we're ready to get home and
 		get ba ck to our routine i think most vacations uh seven days is enough for us we've gone i think when we went to England and France we were there ten twelve days and that was pushing it a bit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		uh i tend when when i spend enough money to go overseas  i go for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that that makes sense
 		it really does i mean oh we went to Panama too
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		went to Panama last August
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		our son-in-law is from Panama
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh he we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents who live there and his father is a a doctor and his mother is a kindergarten teacher and they took time off it was
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		their winter and they were having a little break so they took some time off that uh they could show us around and it it is a beautiful country it is beautiful they have mountains we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore
 	
 	
 		huh
 		that's really nice
 	
 	
 		and it it is gorgeous they live in a small town called David which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it's just it's just a gorgeous country most people don't realize it i think if they could get tourists coming to their country they'd improve the economy considerably
 	
 	
 		huh well may maybe now things are calming down again that will happen
 	
 	
 		yeah we really hope hope so
 	
 	
 		well that that's really great um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i mean as i said well well basically all i've done is go back and forth to parents and uh
 	
 	
 		well that that's that's pretty good that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and and uh we had  my husband had a conference in LA so we spent a week in LA and of course
 	
 	
 		oh do you like LA
 	
 	
 		uh i'm very i'm i'm very unusual i like
