 
     		
 	
 		okay what do you cook
 	
 	
 		well  i have dinner parties quite often and so we we really i really enjoy cooking um
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i like desserts and uh main dishes  i'm a chocoholic
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 		oh yeah well see i consider baking different than cooking though yeah i can i can bake
 	
 	
 		do you yeah yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well you know the best recipes that i have come from Southern Living
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um do you get that magazine
 	
 	
 		no but my mother-in-law tells me and gets it and just loves to get the recipes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh it's wonderful you know i've never had a recipe fail that i've gotten out of Southern Living and i've had dinner guests come over for dinner and
 		you know say i don't know what this is going to taste like  i got it out of Southern Living it's a brand new recipe and i've never tried it before and and i've never had them fail
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow that's great yeah my mother used to like pick out a magazine and show us the pictures and say okay this is what we're going to have and we're like oh God no
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i well well that's what i do too and it has a it's been wonderful right
 	
 	
 		yeah she did really good she did really well but i mean like her four basic food groups were kind of like mine they're frozen canned boxed and take home and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm a very picky eater so that's another part of my problem when i look at a recipe there's ingredients that i don't like or won't taste and so it's kind of difficult
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah where you from originally
 	
 	
 		i'm from Oklahoma and then i've been in Texas for a long time but uh
 	
 	
 		Oklahoma
 		uh-huh so you've had you you know Tex-Mex and that kind of thing i
 	
 	
 		oh yeah definitely now see i love stuff like that but and a lot of it i will eat but there's ingredients sometimes that i'm just like i don't even know what that is
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah well i had never had chili in my whole life until i moved down to Texas and i had Connecticut and i had never even tasted chili and i moved down here and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		where are you from
 		oh wow
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's hysterical because my kids have to have a refried bean fix at least once a week  you know and it's like a week has gone by and we haven't had
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		fajitas or or something and and i just laugh and laugh my family would die if they knew all these things my kids were eating
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 		how funny
 	
 	
 		that is funny that is funny
 	
 	
 		yeah we've always always had southern foods but uh mother my mother is from the deep south and so she would do like the hominy and grits and stuff and i couldn't do that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		no no no i don't think i would i would care for that but you know what i recently discovered there's something um at the grocery store it's called Cajun Magic
 	
 	
 		no
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and it's like in the gourmet section of the grocery store it's on the bottom shelf and and it's um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um uh like red beans and rice with all the spices already in it and all you have to do is add water and and cook it and it is so good
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		that does sound good
 	
 	
 		it is good it is good and it's called Cajun Magic and i'm sure you could probably  you know i buy i buy it at Albertson's
 	
 	
 		okay i'll have to look for that
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		huh and it's in the gourmet section
 	
 	
 		well  you know where they have those kind of hard to find items you know the the real funny mustards and and that spices and things like that and that's that's where they have it at Albertson's and it's really good i like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		huh
 		so your kids aren't picky eaters
 	
 	
 		easy
 		i have a daughter who will eat everything and a son who will eat nothing so  as a matter of fact she's babysitting tonight and she called and she said
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		mom they had the most wonderful dinner it was Hamburger Helper  and it's delicious
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		how funny
 	
 	
 		and i laughed
 	
 	
 		well that's what when i got married um
 		both my husband and i had been living separately so my girlfriend wanted to give me uh a wine shower where people brought recipes
 	
 	
 		what a neat idea
 	
 	
 		yeah it was really neat because they brought the bottle of wine and then they brought a recipe that went with the bottle of wine
 	
 	
 		oh how nice
 	
 	
 		and one of my girlfriends brought a really nice bottle of wine and she had written down the number to Domino's Pizza
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i love it i love it when i worked one time we had a thing where we had uh uh luncheon and everybody had to bring a dish and  somebody
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		gave directions to a to a bakery  you know turn left on Campbell Road and right on you know  and that was cute that was cute
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well
 		desserts are definitely a weakness but uh oh i love them and i'm definitely a chocoholic but i found something it's a white chocolate mousse cake
 	
 	
 		do you like desserts
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that is just heaven
 	
 	
 		is it wonderful
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah but i wouldn't even know how to begin to make it
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		but i need to definitely find the recipe and at least attempt it because it it's so good
 	
 	
 		oh i would love that i i like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not crazy about sweets but i really have a passion for cakes any kind of cake i i really like chocolate cake and um apple cake
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 		ooh i've never had apple cake
 	
 	
 		love apple cake oh i love apple cake or spice cake something like that yeah yeah i really like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		especially in the morning that's really good then
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah it is yeah it is
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i'm getting hungry now
 	
 	
 		and i just got done with dinner so  um we had beef ribs and a potato casserole and a salad yeah i do i well
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really what did you fix
 		um
 		God you really are a cook
 	
 	
 		you know it was so funny when i was when i was reading the things and they said you know checkoff different categories that you could talk about i thought food i could talk about food  have you not eaten yet tonight
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i i did i went to the doctor the other day and my cholesterol is really high and so he's putting me on a special diet on Tuesday and that's what when the category came up tonight i thought oh God i'm so glad this is tonight and not next week because
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um he's putting me on a liquid protein diet and so
 	
 	
 		oh really was your was your cholesterol that high
 	
 	
 		it was two forty and i'm only twenty nine years old
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so he said let's bring that down so he's putting me on some liquid protein and i'm not doing to be able to eat for two weeks
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		really wow
 	
 	
 		yeah i kept telling my husband while a go
 	
 	
 		is two forty really that high though
 	
 	
 		it is for for me and my age bracket
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um so i think it's supposed to be one eighty and he thought two forty was a little bit high for me
 	
 	
 		you know what i just recently got um a cookbook it's it's the oh what's the name of it
 		uh Love Your Heart
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		cookbook it's a low cholesterol
 		cookbook and then i got the American Heart Association cookbook now this is not Southern Living
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah lots of yogurt and stuff like that but if you go to like the Bookstop do you have one of those in Carrollton
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		um they have lots and lots of of uh cookbooks with low cholesterol recipes
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i every once in a while i get real ambitious and i think okay i'm going to do all this wonderful stuff and then that lasts for about a week  and then i'm like give me the blue cheese dressing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		
 
 		i want a burrito
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah give me some more refried beans have you have you tried
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it's like like Oprah Winfrey says every once in a while you've just got to have ribs
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah have you tried the the no fat no cholesterol dressings like the Kraft
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i i've tried them
 	
 	
 		the Italian is the Italian is not bad
 	
 	
 		well see that that's part of my problem though it goes back to being such a picky eater the only one i like is Ranch which is like the worst as far as cholesterol goes so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah and does it take have you tried that is it terrible
 	
 	
 		um i haven't tried the new ones that Heart Smart or not
 	
 	
 		heartwise or heart yeah
 	
 	
 		i haven't tried the the newest one yet so what i've been trying to do is just cutback because i just recently even started eating dressing and the only one i like like i said is Ranch
