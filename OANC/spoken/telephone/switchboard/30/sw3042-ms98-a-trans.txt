 		all the farmers you know well it's good for hay you know all the farmers got their first cut of hay and everything but they're going to need some more you know rain to get the second cut
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i i'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field and if we don't have rain she's going to lose a lot of money
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 		well we have been drenched
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we have had so much rain for May and June that we've got all the uh
 		weather people down here really confused
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		uh we it's probably it it's just
 	
 	
 		it's usually dry down there isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah right now by now it's usually no you know it's quit raining you know by at least a month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's still we're still having April showers for June yeah uh i don't know where where it came from but it's been really we got a lot of uh
 	
 	
 		oh i hope they come this way
 	
 	
 		we're in central Texas and it feels like we live in Houston
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it it you know like it rained today and then it just kind of steamed everything up you know uh it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system but it's uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's hard to plan anything outside just because they show up
 		out of nowhere and then they're gone we've had some with
 		really really high winds that have trashed trees and everything else it's just
 	
 	
 		oh my now see every everyone up here with their gardens they're not going to have much of a garden this year because it's so dry
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i hope you get some of that we've had enough we have had plenty and we're still uh forecast for more yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well gee uh does California is California getting rain then
 	
 	
 		uh i'm not real sure i think a lot of this is coming out of i think what's happening of it's coming out of Canada and it's meeting what's coming out of the Gulf
 	
 	
 		out of the Gulf
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's just causing chaos and i mean these are good these are good summer rains you know electrical storms and and all that so it's been
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's been uh wet and we've mowed our yard i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		three or four times in the last two or three weeks i mean just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing and
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and one one week it just rained thunderstormed for a day straight and you couldn't get out there you just couldn't get out there by the time you finally got there well your lawn mower wouldn't sink we were you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah lawn mower broke  so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well see now we need we could use two days straight of rain
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's really drying up up here
 	
 	
 		well what always works for me is if i water my plants or we wash the car it usually rains if not that night the next day
 	
 	
 		no no i was telling everyone hang your clothes out on the line and it's surely going to rain whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains
 	

 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		we've had real hot weather
 	
 	
 		hotter than usual
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we've you know and uh let me think
 		i got out of school in May
 		in March i was wearing shorts
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		i was wearing shorts in March up at college and uh we we what they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		is what they said what happened
 	
 	
 		huh
 		i guess that means you're going to get a double long summer
 	
 	
 		i hope that
 		oh i don't know but i hope it doesn't mean we're going to get an early winter
 	
 	
 		because you surely wouldn't get
 		no i wouldn't think so
 		i wouldn't not as early as it came i mean your talking September maybe that's a little early still the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh yeah i was wearing shorts in March you know it was nippy but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like it was still in the seventies
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know high sixties low seventies in March
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we were there we were in New Jersey last October and it was hotter there than it was here it was just like a heat wave and i was like oh i want to go home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah we haven't
 	
 	
 		because uh we had we packed to cool off you know brought short sleeve sweaters and everything and we just died it was really hot so but i like it here i wouldn't i wouldn't trade it for snow any day yeah
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		huh
 		really
 		see i like i like the snow but i like to watch it fall and i just like it where it's deep enough you know but not too deep
 	
 	
 		right and i can handle a vacation in it and
 		you know but my husband is from New Jersey and he wouldn't go back either he did all the shoveling and everything else he said it was a pain so
 	
 	
 		really
 		
 
 		well is it weird at Christmas time without snow
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so well see last year we had snow at Christmas time
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so it really wasn't it was weird because we had snow  it's like wow it actually fell on the right day so uh no it's not in fact uh you know we're used to running around in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know Spring clothes in December and so when it throws in a real cool
 		winter we get broken pipes and and all that kind of stuff and because Texas is just just isn't built for you know real cold weather for long periods of time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's real dry down there you don't have the humidity either do you
 	
 	
 		no not not where we are now in Houston stuff they've got it
 		they've got it where no hair spray works
 		it's so humid at times but here it's it's just about right it's it's pretty dry and not too dry where you know you just it hurts to breathe but we're just about right we're just having this all this rain and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable made it the humidity real high but no i like it well we're right in a good stop because we're
 	
 	
 		yeah muggy huh
 	
 	
 		you know we get over in the over the hundreds in the summer but it's it's not it's a dry heat and it's not really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as hot and muggy as it would be being over hundred plus ninety degree humidity ninety percent humidity
 	
 	
 		yeah see that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you know hundred and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it so you're like real mucky and you you know your legs stick together just from walking you know so um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		yeah i know what
 		so we like it where we're at if it's not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		but no it's interesting when it gets really cold here and people forget that they're live in Texas and they don't know how to drive in snow and you know but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't trade it for anything  i was born in Texas and i visited other areas and i'm just a sun person i think gotten used to it
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 		
 
 		well i don't know well
 		i guess that's really about all
 	
 	
 		yeah weather is not real hard to talk about  it doesn't last real long either i thought the weather is the last thing you talk about but in this case it's the only thing to talk about but well Michelle it's great talking to
