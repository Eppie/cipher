 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		do you have children
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh yes yes i have a daughter yeah she's only about uh uh a little less than two years old
 	
 	
 		do you how old is she
 		
 
 		uh  i guess you have not reached the stage where you need to uh
 		promote a college or anything huh  i've got one that's seven and one that's three so we uh we started saving but that's all
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so do you is there are you planning to like encourage your children to go to a particular school
 	
 	
 		uh um  no uh um no particular school uh i think that's really
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no such decision that
 	
 	
 		that you are going to let them make
 	
 	
 		that
 		they well help them make in terms of you know what they are they are wanting to do you know that that's a big influence i think and you know what not only what you can afford but what
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh you know you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do
 	
 	
 		yeah where did you go to school
 	
 	
 		uh University of Mississippi
 	
 	
 		oh was that local or uh
 	
 	
 		uh well it was
 		well it was in within the state
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it it wasn't necessarily local it was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i i mean so what's
 	
 	
 		what's the criterion for choosing to go there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh well at the time i was uh thinking of going premed and in the state uh they had the best premed uh curriculum for the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh state institutions it was choice between there and uh a private college that uh was a bit more expensive at the time we really could not afford it so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me it uh i enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		so you did you commute everyday then or oh okay
 	
 	
 		no
 		
 
 		no it was a six hour drive
 	
 	
 		oh okay when you said it was quite a quite a way away i did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour or
 	
 	
 		well well
 		i was uh
 		it it was like another world
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		basically it was a no it was a
 		did not get home that often you know and at that age it's uh it's kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of difficult sometimes too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		especially if you have not been away a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that that extended
 	
 	
 		so did you go there like straight out of high school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh see i did not get my degree until later on so i just finished mine a couple of years ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i guess
 		you know when you have to do it that way it makes makes your choices a lot easier but
 	
 	
 		uh that's true
 		yeah that that's like you know when i went on to get my my masters i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		basically
 		was you know it was where i was at the time you know i wasn't gonna
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		try to pick and go somewhere else because i was pretty much settled and i was trying to work
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but uh so when you are first going to school that you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		yeah
 		what which group do you work in in TI
 	
 	
 		um uh the computer science center
 	
 	
 		oh uh where is that at
 	
 	
 		uh north building
 	
 	
 		i see
 		how long do you work for TI
 	
 	
 		uh
 		about three years
 	
 	
 		did you work somewhere else like sounds like you got your masters before here or
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i have uh uh
 		no actually i mean i came straight from school to here so
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		so cause this was the first first real job after getting my degree
 	
 	
 		uh-huh after your masters or after your
 	
 	
 		after my masters my undergraduate degree was not in not in what my masters was
 	
 	
 		i see
 		i see
 	
 	
 		so i made
 		career change basically
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i see
 		well let's see  i have not you know there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools you know just like you said
 		uh depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford different things like that so i i have not really made up my mind you know whether to encourage them to go different places or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i mean i would like to uh you know the uh i i like the school where i went i mean and i would not
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hesitate at all to uh to encourage her to go there if she wanted to or the school where i got my masters at which which was a different school and uh
 	
 	
 		right right
 		right
 	
 	
 		i liked it almost as well uh but uh you know that i'm not going to hold them to that just because i went there i you know think that's If they want to that's fine but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		otherwise not although i can uh would get quite a break on on tuition  yeah because they uh allow for uh
 	
 	
 		um because you went there
 	
 	
 		uh tuition uh break for out of state students who
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		children of alumnae
 	
 	
 		i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		well certain schools do it this school does so uh it's been  been interesting i i was involved in some uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh alumnae recruiting uh here in town uh recently uh well last year uh and it was kind of fun because you are trying to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to trying to get people interested in your school you know and they were this was a college night at a at a high school in Richardson and it was and there were a bunch of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kids you know and a bunch of schools there were a hundred schools probably there all competing for the same kids it's kind of interesting to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to to talk up you know your school and i was surprised by the number of kids that came came by and had heard of you know our school and and were interested in it
 	
 	
 		yeah your old school
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh you know we uh you you situations like that you don't realize you know until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i i was real real pleased with that that worked out so well
 	
 	
 		yeah so did you drum up any interest then or
 	
 	
 		i think so i don't know offhand but uh it seemed like there were quite a few
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kids that were definitely interested in going there
 		so there there was one mother who uh came by right even before we started who who obviously was uh very interested in getting her her daughter in or or
 	
 	
 		and that
 	
 	
 		having gotten her daughter in or something and she was wanting some more information but she was her her daughter was uh
 		a a majorette majorette drum a majorette or something you know a baton twirler or something and she was  she was letting us know she  how how
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		her daughter was she had cards printed up actually describing you know business cards describing her daughter's uh you know she had won several different twirling awards and all this and she was
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		had these business cards she was passing out and it was  quite a production  i think some parents go a little bit overboard
 	
 	
 		yeah it sounds like it well you know i think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely
 	
 	
 		yes
