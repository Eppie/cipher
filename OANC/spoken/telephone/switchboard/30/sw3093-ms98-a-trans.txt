 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well this is the season for vacations and uh
 		i guess for places i like to go i enjoy going to the beach and
 		having having outdoor being outdoors somewhere and someplace that's very different than Texas and uh as far as
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		maybe maybe as the summer heat comes along i'd sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot and being able to be outside and enjoy outsor outside activities so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		enjoy going places where i i enjoy playing tennis so i like to have a tennis court there or or if it's at the beach the beach is great a pool is great and uh
 	
 	
 		where where do you usually go
 	
 	
 		oh well let's see we have plans this year to drive up to the uh to Colorado and we'll be going to Estes Park and Colorado Springs so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		one year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado into Durango and north of the area there and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		boy that's that's a nice nice place to visit it's really nice uh there's a nice nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh and then actually north north of that is another town and
 		a smaller on a smaller scale i guess than Silverton but uh and then there's lots and lots of real uh of mountains that are covered with uh boulders
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i guess people Jeep through that area and we didn't have a chance to do that but i sure would like to go back there and do that again
 	
 	
 		right
 		we're um
 		uh we haven't had a vacation in several years so so  be our first chance in awhile in awhile uh
 		we're going to go to uh
 		Destin Florida which is a
 		very nice beach area if you're not familiar with it it
 	
 	
 		i haven't been but i've heard it's wonderful
 	
 	
 		oh it's it's gorgeous uh we used to go quite a bit uh
 		before i moved out here we were closer and uh used to  go almost
 		every summer uh and just just rent a condo
 		there on the beach uh there's quite a few uh there's a lot of development of of condominiums there along the beach front
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		
 
 		so they have uh
 		they're very very large condos and they have quite a few rooms
 		and uh so we we'll usually rent one for about a week or so and
 	
 	
 		right and the beach is nice the beach is really nice isn't it
 	
 	
 		and go down
 		oh yeah it's it just uh just beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and uh a lot of
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		nice waves usually uh
 	
 	
 		sea shells
 	
 	
 		enough enough to make it i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		sea shells
 	
 	
 		uh there's not as many sea shells along there uh that's the only thing that they really don't they have some but not not so much um if you go further down uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you'll usually find some but not right in there uh i don't know why it is but uh just
 		it seems not to not to have as many there but uh we we enjoy it uh it's the place where we stay is we stay we usually stay at the same place every year and
 		
 
 		they are like i say right on the beach so it's uh
 	
 	
 		oh where do you stay and my husband always wants to go to Destin we just haven't gone that direction yet
 	
 	
 		it's a place called Jetty East uh J E T T Y E A S T
 		and it's uh called that because it's at the very end of uh a jetty there which is uh sort of the end of this little little point and uh it's a at the very end it's the last set of condominiums there and it's uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it's very nice uh it's not very expensive uh you can i think we're going to go with another couple and their their kids and uh
 		they have a we have a uh
 		i think it's three bedroom or two bedroom uh condominium which will sleep
 		i don't know quite a few uh six or eight and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because it's got you know pull out couches and all that and uh i think it's going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week
 	
 	
 		oh  that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is because um the uh
 		you know it's got its own kitchen full size kitchen and everything and this one i think has two baths and it's the one we got is on the uh on the beach side so
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh nice
 	
 	
 		we've got a beautiful view and balcony and uh just you know really it's really a nice stay
 		uh in fact we stayed there on on our honeymoon we i had won a trip to the Bahamas but didn't get to take it on our honeymoon time so we instead went there uh
 		and loved it just as much as as if we had gone to the Bahamas we in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked the uh the particular room uh uh uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh suite that we had gotten was very nice and so we decided to stay
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh it's a pretty nice place you'll need to try to go and and stay there sometime but
 	
 	
 		well we've just
 		we've just
 	
 	
 		it's a little far from here but uh
 	
 	
 		are you driving
 	
 	
 		yeah we are we're it'll take uh
 		a day and a half to get there probably
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well
 		well we're uh the neighborhood that we live in they're switching to an alternate calendar this year so
 		it starting
 		well starting at the end of July we'll have two vacation weeks in October and two vacation weeks in March
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that'll be interesting turn on vacations for our family
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		uh what does what does that mean alternate
 	
 	
 		well it's  what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school three weeks of vacation nine weeks of school three weeks of vacation
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh in and in the summer would be more like a two month
 		two month break
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so and they hope to boost the
 		they hope to boost the learning of the children
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		just the retention of
 		the material for them so uh
 	
 	
 		kind of scattering the vacation out throughout the year
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it   so anyway so maybe maybe within a year we'll see how that falls
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we'll head for we'll head for Florida maybe in somewhat of an off season instead of summer
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so uh
