 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well this is a very timely topic in as much as we're going to a family reunion this weekend yes
 	
 	
 		oh are you really where is it going to be
 	
 	
 		down at Lake Texoma lodge yes this is one that's uh the Baker family reunion
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and this has been going on at least uh i would say at least twenty five years or thirty something like that maybe longer than that i'm going to get back into the fifties sometime
 	
 	
 		oh that's marvelous
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		first time i got i married into the family and the first time i went was about fifty seven i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh this one has been uh
 		been well organized
 		and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood and now it's Lake Texoma because that's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i'm sure location is really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be
 	
 	
 		very important because uh you'll start losing people if it's too far to go
 	
 	
 		um-hum we have factions when it's one part we i have one reunion on my mother's side and we found that if it's in a certain part of Texas
 		some people come and if it's elsewhere other people come we never get them at both of them it seems like so i think we need to find a new place
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		never get them at both places
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		listen they've uh they've had this one well it just of course over the years it has uh built up as far as the organization is concerned but now they uh have a golf tournament on the Saturday
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		and then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such
 	
 	
 		oh that's a neat idea
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh everyone uh they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge and everyone brings in food
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant and uh it really uh has worked out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		how many people Jim are involved
 	
 	
 		uh generally uh i think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people i think normal is about sixty or seventy
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah well i guess um ours probably isn't that big our family is dwindling for one thing
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i often feel funny because i'm in a branch that's all but died i just have one aunt and my family
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so sometimes when these other families get together they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids and we're kind of off on the sidelines
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it does remind us that we have family and roots so we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah well our family started reunion started out my wife and i were the kids the newlyweds so to speak
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and now we go our children go and our grandchildren are going now so it's uh wound up that uh we're the old folks now
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but um they have various organized they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes uh to pitch and they organize a baseball game for the kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and several people bring boats
 		and there's a place they they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon so it it's a full day some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend and some just come in for Saturday
 	
 	
 		so there's lots to do
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it uh has worked out quite well and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's true
 		well that's neat i i think they're really fun we go to mine regularly and then we go to my husband's occasionally down in Temple and he has a large family so it's it's fun when we go to that one
 	
 	
 		yeah my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia and i think we've been to one in thirty five years  or something like that so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that's just too far away
 	
 	
 		oh it would be more yeah yeah that that is a problem with the distance the people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way and it's just too much for all of them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's an all day drive just to get to this area
 	
 	
 		all of that group to travel right
 		but then we have the same attitude when it's out there although this year we're going out they're going to have it at Fort Davis and we thought that would be
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we have uh
 		each year of course they elect officers of the family reunion and a number of years ago back in the early eighties my wife was president we discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together and it takes a lot of planning and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		and choose some place that everybody's going to like
 	
 	
 		assembling of stuff
 		right
 	
 	
 		as far as food and all that
 	
 	
 		that's correct
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's a heavy burden
 	
 	
 		yes it is  i i i don't really care for her to be president again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but that is uh
 		it's it's a lot of work but it's a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we've enjoyed it and
 	
 	
 		well i think
 	
 	
 		the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and it's it's good for kids to know that they have other family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and this year they're all excited The show this weekend this weekend is going to be a rock and roll show my two grandsons and one of their cousins are are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know in jeans and T-shirts and such
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		oh what fun
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's uh it's going to be exciting for them and for us too
 	
 	
 		um-hum probably lots of laughs
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there have been some really wild shows put on there
 		they uh really get uh into it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along ours ours is still kind of loosely organized and the same people usually get stuck with doing it and
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		oh that generally happens
 	
 	
 		they do it as a labor of love so the officer idea is a good idea
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah well we've uh had various things over the years uh to raise funds for it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and again it's not it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting meeting room down in the cabins and such but uh they've come up with they've tried passing the hat and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		some people do and some people don't
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's not fair that everybody not contribute
 	
 	
 		
 
 		excuse me
 		but um anyway that's the family reunion story
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well thanks a lot i enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		been nice talking to you
