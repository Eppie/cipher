 
     		
 	
 		on my father's side we've really there uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		does your family normally have a reunion do you have one that's been
 	
 	
 		on my father's side we've really there uh on my mother's side we've had several not it's not really on a regular basis but usually sometimes every few summers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well see all the family lives in one place except for
 		a few of us that are scattered about so they're pretty much just reunited always so it's it's
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well it might be a good time for you to begin to to start a tradition you could be responsible for that yourself
 	
 	
 		i know that's
 		they do that that's true how about your family
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well in my family
 		let's see last October was the forty fifth annual uh reunion the first Sunday in October the Jordan family gets together
 	
 	
 		wow you're a pro at this
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		and all of the descendants of the Civil War i mean yeah the Civil War veteran come together and they come as far away as from California and there's usually
 		oh between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people
 	
 	
 		and then where do you meet
 	
 	
 		in uh there's a big community hall in Vernon
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		Texas and uh that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family
 	
 	
 		okay do you have relatives in Vernon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then okay
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh a lot of the older family lives in Vernon um all of his direct descendants descendants have now died and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so we're talking about second and third great children here
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i take my boys
 		well i took them up till this year they're grown and gone from home now so they take their family but uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh let's see that would make them grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather okay so it would be the second great grandchild
 	
 	
 		okay so this town hall that you meet in is that like a um
 	
 	
 		it's uh
 		well it's a community center it's a community hall it's a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen in it
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh you just bring the covered dishes every every family brings a a dish of some kind and you get all the wonderful old family recipes that have been handed down for years
 	
 	
 		potato salad and the
 	
 	
 		well we try to stay away from those things which might have uh salmonella in them
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		and we choose to bring congealed salad you can bring a congealed vegetable salad as opposed to potato salad and we are very conscious of most of us are very conscious of of uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		sanitation aspects whatever you've got to carry for any distance i always take home baked bread
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
 		oh that's nice
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		uh that happens to be my specialty for that family i do other things very well but there are others in the family who do them better
 	
 	
 		do they always have  the the one person in the family who knows or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best and that's what they get to cook
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's good well i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions so i learned a lot about them i haven't been to a lot but we talked a lot about the the rituals you she equated the family reunion with the Protestant
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage it was it was an interesting theory she talked about the um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that Catholics all it's a home centered you know it's all family centered anyway so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all your you don't have to come home so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe
 		but when the Protestant ethic happened in America there were people who ever went out and you know went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for the reunion so that became their version of the pilgrimage
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		but she had it was interesting you know i  don't know how valid it is but she talked about that and how the the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and
 		um you know about the bread and the ritual placement do you have a a certain way that everything's
 		placed out on the table every every year is there kind of a you know salads go first and things like that
 	
 	
 		well it's uh we have uh uh kind of a core group that that serves as quote officers of the organization and they plan the reunions they
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		organize the you know who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who's going to rent the tables who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer uh and each year it's done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles
 	
 	
 		that's pretty fancy
 	
 	
 		we have a biographer who who continues every year to save clippings on any family member and they're entered into a a wonderful uh scrap book
 		and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone And it keeps the family alive even you know even though it's very fluid and they're very dedicated to that
 	
 	
 		sure does that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		it's been really wonderful it helps you hang on to your roots
 	
 	
 		yeah i wish we'd
 	
 	
 		and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family his family was very scattered and very diverse
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i asked him i got to talking to him i said well how is his nephew doing well i don't know i haven't talked to my brother in three years well how's your brother doing i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um you know my son keeps in touch with him i think but i don't i said hey wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people yeah but i'm you know it's too much trouble
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one
 	
 	
 		wow you're just uh
 		oh that's incredible
 	
 	
 		to our place down at Lake Tawakoni liked to kill me because i had it was i didn't have that group cooperation i did it by myself
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh nobody brought covered dishes we had a great big fish fry and you know i fixed a salad in a number three tub and  and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping and uh we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and i told him
 	
 	
 		have you have you done this repetitively or just once
 	
 	
 		we did it that year and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there we sent invitations we said please let us know if you're coming it was when uh his mother his
 		step father had died the year before his mother was alone and so they came to support her and then one by one his brothers you know his sisters he began to lose family members
 	
 	
 		see that's we've we had a problem with that
 	
 	
 		and it was difficult to hold them together and then of course he died t wo years ago so
 		and you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh it i think that's what happens when they get scattered the the family unit
 		you know falls into disrepair
 	
 	
 		right that's what was our problem we had uh the first reunion or the first you know major reunion was probably six or seven years ago and then the second reunion people who maybe you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sacrifice things to come to the first one though oh well it's not that big a thing this year and so it kind of wound down and then finally
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you're lucky to get the Shreveport relatives there but no one else
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well see we manage those people who are at that core group manage to keep keep the vigor alive they'll send out news bulletins two or three times a year you'll get a news bulletin hey guess who got
 	
 	
 		shows up
 	
 	
 		you know elected to the legislature or guess who's our local sheriff
