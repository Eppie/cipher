 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh
 	
 	
 		do you have annual family reunions or
 	
 	
 		uh yeah uh our  the
 		my my my mother's side of the family is quite large or well was quite large at one time and uh  they uh
 		for as long as i can remember have had uh a yearly reunion um back uh
 		early on they used to to rotate them from house from some to
 		to different people's houses in the family
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		all local were they like all in Dallas
 	
 	
 		and uh no no not no this was well i am actually from Mississippi and so that's it was it was around there generally uh that's where the family
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		just from city to city then huh
 	
 	
 		grew yeah and it was not only in Mississippi in some other places as well so it was uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		it it it was a big deal but uh they they tried to to centralize it in one spot so in the past couple of years they had it at um state park every year
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		we rent a pavilion and and do that and that's usually works out to be pretty good uh they will rent a pervilion pavilion on a weekend and uh
 	
 	
 		do you go back
 	
 	
 		i haven't gone back lately in fact uh this past Sunday was the uh was the reunion but i didn't get to go uh i have
 	
 	
 		is it choice or just business or
 	
 	
 		not getting to go uh just uh the distance involved and uh just not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i have a younger daughter now and uh i it's kind of hard to get her  get her there and everything but i am going to to uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		hopefully next year get to go back because uh a lot of
 		the family has not uh on her side my mother's side has not seen you know my daughter so
 	
 	
 		oh do you have brothers and sisters
 	
 	
 		i have one brother
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh and is your mother still living
 	
 	
 		so
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh so so you go back and visit with her anyway wouldn't you i mean either way there was family reunion time or
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		right i i usually see her a couple times a year so that's no no
 	
 	
 		or not
 	
 	
 		big thing but uh i uh
 		i do i do enjoy the reunions the only problem is that now um originally originally when we had them uh they were mainly my mother's
 		uh father's my mother's father's family had quite a few uh
 	
 	
 		relatives right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		brothers and sisters so it was a large reunion of of of of that group uh from that descendancy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh a lot of those people have and and at time you know they all knew one another
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and now it's gotten uh that uh a lot of those people are died have uh have died off or you know what we are left with is the the relatives of of of that group
 	
 	
 		the next generation uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so uh it's not quite as close as it used to be so i think people feel less of a of a desire to really go i know that
 	
 	
 		why why why do you think that it's less close than it used to be
 	
 	
 		well i i just think that uh you know at that time when when they were you know  those were all brothers and sisters a lot and
 		or they were all in the same area geographical location you know back back around you know in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um you know they were all located together together in one small community
 	
 	
 		right right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and as as time grew  i mean when time went on
 		the family grew and moved away and so forth and now when you when you they come together it's it's generally you know like say the kids kids of those people who are not
 		you know anywhere near one another and i don't think they feel the the the closeness that they used to be there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which is a shame but that's just how it is my mother was complaining last year about the you know it's dwindling down every year you know that's just i think that's just
 	
 	
 		is that just family's lack of priority anymore maybe yes
 		that we get so involved in our work lives and
 		just
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		social lives and so forth that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's uh yeah i think that's some of it but you know I
 		i i it's just the way you know i think society society is now is that we are not we don't have the extensive family we used to it's more of a you know a smaller
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		smaller unit and you know we we tend to try to do things i think with with our immediate family as opposed to the extended family of people that we may or may not remember or know you know very well uh
 	
 	
 		right right
 		it really makes an effort on to to do this anymore right right
 	
 	
 		right it requires a lot of effort to to to to do that sort of thing i mean i
 		i used to enjoy going i mean i still do kind of enjoy it but uh it's it doesn't it's not as many people there that i really really enjoy seeing
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you know i it's going just for the sake of getting together i think for the family and
 	
 	
 		do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		on a regular basis not just Christmas cards though
 	
 	
 		um um no not really that in that but then again uh
 		well i you know i have some aunts that uh i i i i do that's about  my mother's sisters
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know but i feel closer to them because i kind of grew up with them but but uh as for the you know for the rest of that group no not really
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion so uh you do not really feel that
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		that really close to them
 	
 	
 		right in my my uh father's family we get together  every year at a different location either Dallas or Oklahoma City they had chosen Santa Barbara California for this summer and
 		and didn't get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or like in the Texas Oklahoma area
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so they canceled that one and uh are looking next year bringing it back closer but we have a letter a family letter
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that circulates and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top
 		and then that's the way it's kept in order and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion
 		you don't feel like i don't know anything about this person you've you've read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth so you are kind of half way acquainted that way
 	
 	
 		that's a good idea
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that that's been a that's been a nice way of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		keeping us all aware of each other i think
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we tried to start that in my husband's family his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago and i said well let's start this letter
 		and it just never  my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got i sent it on to the next one and and but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in Scottsdale Arizona for that family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		we're real glad we got together because since that that time there were only like two of the one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left and the sister-in-law died and the sister is in a nursing home so
 		we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago
