 
     		
 	
 		so do you have PC
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i have a personal computer at home it's an AT compatible
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		i don't use it very much any more i used to use it quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i also have a PC at work that i use as a terminal i do some PC stand alone work on it and i can transfer data back and forth between the PC and the main frame
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what about you do you own a computer
 	
 	
 		um well i sort of own a computer we have two PCs at home but neither one do we really own
 		um both are no both of them are sort of work related and
 	
 	
 		are you leasing them
 		loners loaners from work
 	
 	
 		yeah  that's the nicer way right of
 	
 	
 		do you work for TI
 	
 	
 		no no um i actually i'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby and my husband's working at Bell Labs but he's really from France and these computers actually are from France
 	
 	
 		what brand are they
 	
 	
 		one of them's a Compaq
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's a three eighty six
 	
 	
 		i'm jealous
 	
 	
 		and the other is actually a
 		IBM PC compatible it's a three eighty six
 		guess it's twenty five
 		yeah three eight six twenty five C maybe i don't know no we don't have the cash that's right we decided not to get the cash which is actually another loaner one too that we've picked up
 		for a consulting job that my husband was doing  and
 	
 	
 		what kind of consulting do you do
 	
 	
 		um well i actually do some work working at MIT and at NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in Washington and then i worked for Dragon Systems
 		for a while
 	
 	
 		what kind of work do you do when you're consulting
 	
 	
 		um well it depends it's very different in the different places
 		but
 	
 	
 		is it programming related
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah program related research related i've
 		i work in speech the speech field and i i do a lot about acoustics phonetics and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		looking at the uh acoustic characteristics of speech and so i do that type of stuff typically
 		for other people and we use uh here we use the PCs to do that and mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that
 	
 	
 		word processing
 	
 	
 		well more uh do you know Latek
 	
 	
 		no i'm not familiar with it
 	
 	
 		word text word text processing so i don't i don't use  i mean you can call it word processing but i don't usually use a word processor to do it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we don't have too much standard software like i haven't bought
 		we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all so we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that we use it more for just writing programs when we need to
 		or um
 		doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing
 		and also as a
 		just as a terminal and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that
 	
 	
 		so you've got you've got a modem in it then
 	
 	
 		uh neither one has a modem but we have a modem
 	
 	
 		at home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them
 	
 	
 		neither one
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh and so it's an external modem i got when i got mine i had an internal modem in it i used it uh quite a bit when i was um
 	
 	
 		yeah we have
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh looking at uh information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a
 		in Fort Worth but uh went out of town for a while and and sort of got off the uh uh bulletin board and of my micro completely
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without uh even without using it on the computer i could turn a computer on it'd start squawking so i finally opened up the box and took it out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so that was it
 	
 	
 		i think that's the thirty second warning
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't hear it
 		do you hear the the beep in the background
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh that's a an ambulance or something going on here i think
 	
 	
 		okay where
 	
 	
 		i haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually
 	
 	
 		where are you and uh
 	
 	
 		in Manhattan
 	
 	
 		are you at home now so you've got a lot of traffic noise real close
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm at home
 		uh-huh so it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal i mean because there's a lot of background noise that you know people can hear so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up um
 		yeah and often times that i can't talk on the can't do this much later than now between sort of like six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone conversation
 	
 	
 		what time is it now where you are
 	
 	
 		uh about twenty after four
 	
 	
 		so you're an hour ahead of where i am i'm in Central Central time zone
 	
 	
 		okay yeah we're Eastern
 		and um
 		what did did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems
 	
 	
 		no i haven't done that uh i know someone who has and and she's uh very uh pleased with it she told me some of the things you can do and it's just a a very uh handy tool to have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and and you can do a lot it it makes things very convenient you can save a lot of money too certainly cut down on long distance charges if you if that's what you have in mind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i've never tried using that i don't know too much about it what about have you did you use commercially available software or
 	
 	
 		i have uh i have used Lotus i have used uh Word Perfect uh i not heavy use i've used uh D Base and uh i've used a substantial amount of shareware
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job i've been through three classes and i have a great deal of respect for it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i haven't done much word processing work with my job i do some and i and the D Base work i've done was strictly class related
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		i've never used D Base  um but i've heard both good things and bad things about it
 	
 	
 		well it's probably the
 		granddaddy of most uh data base management systems there it's got some pretty uh strong competitors some of them have reviews that are better than D Base so i uh i uh i think uh by now it's a matter of uh personal taste
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use
 	
 	
 		i can understand that very easily i've used uh i've had a class on um R Base and also in Paradox and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days
 	
 	
 		um  i wouldn't say compatible but there certainly comparable
 	
 	
 		well i don't i yeah i didn't mean compatible i meant comparable my brain is going to mush
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and what do you work on at TI
 	
 	
 		i'm a computer programmer on the IBM main frames  i do uh main mainly business data processing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um
 		sometimes i get called late at night at home because there's a production problem and that gives me the opportunity to
 		come in to work and fix it if i can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		fun
 	
 	
 		i also uh handle most of the calls from our users and
 		other programmers who need to find out something were connected
