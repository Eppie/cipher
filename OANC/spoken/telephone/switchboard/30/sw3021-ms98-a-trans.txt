 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i grew up out in the country and uh was used to having uh guns around the place and uh i'm
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm not for gun control in the strictest sense of the uh word
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i i think i'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself you know i have quite a collection myself and you know i'm a good hunter and i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		started hunting when i was twelve years old of course my parents made me take hunters safety classes and you know i don't want to see them ban guns completely but i don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i i feel that its uh i think the what was it the National Rifle Association uh had this bumper sticker a few years back if uh about if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns then
 	
 	
 		so
 		i believe that
 	
 	
 		and i believe that too because the person that's wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun gun gun a knife a a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns uh we can handle it but there's a element that can't
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's you know it's got to the point now where even our our police departments and our DEA agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons because everybody that's in drug trafficking trafficking has got them
 	
 	
 		you have got them outgunned
 	
 	
 		you know yeah so
 	
 	
 		there was a an article in the paper just this week where i think it's uh
 		one of the gun companies i can't remember which was developing a ten millimeter ten millimeter
 		automatic pistol for the FBI which would give them additional firepower it had held like a fifteen shot clip which uh would be able they they would be able to put down anything that came at them
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 		yeah that would be
 	
 	
 		but if you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun uh a a a thirty eight uh Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 		no it's sure not huh-uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i have lived in uh Illinois at one time and they they passed a uh it wasn't really gun control but it was you had to register as a gun owner you didn't have to list your guns
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you had to have this card it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and that's the first uh this was twenty years ago but they had that so that uh they were trying to control it a little bit uh in that respect
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		see in California they
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		in California they make you register when you buy ammunition
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you have to sign a they you know take your name and driver's license number hunter hunting license number and all that good stuff before you can buy any big ammunition
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		especially for handguns now rifles aren't too bad but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know any kind of handgun at all if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you still have to buy it or sign up for it so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		we lived in Tennessee for awhile and i bought a pistol there and there was a fifteen day waiting period you had to fill out an application and go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		gee
 	
 	
 		and then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing
 	
 	
 		gee that's not a bad idea
 	
 	
 		and no i think that uh you know a a waiting period uh can make a difference but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah it is
 	
 	
 		so there's i don't think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because
 	
 	
 		no
 		the the only way they could do it i think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you know i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course i i feel kind of weird about that anyway i think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm  we we're getting into capital punishment now  but i i agree with you there that uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah but you know
 		it would definitely be gun control
 	
 	
 		yeah the uh the again the purpose of gun control is to control how it's being used is what the purpose should be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm in favor of keeping the the illegal guy from getting one in his hands but the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element
 	
 	
 		myself
 		yeah well and the they're actually a necessity in life you know they're not you know not everybody needs a gun but
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		sooner or later i need one you know whether i'm out hunting or you know i've never had to protect my life or well i did in the service but not you know not on the street
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i don't really need one in the aspect in the aspects
 	
 	
 		you don't have to carry one in your car or your uh  or your pocket all the time yeah
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 		oh so mine are you know i use mine for recreation i don't and i enjoyed my guns i have a good time with them so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well i know what uh i took my kids out and taught them how to shoot a gun gun my wife the same thing uh she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not not that i have an arsenal or anything but we have several guns around the house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		one of these days my grandkids probably
 	
 	
 		probably yeah
 	
 	
 		but i think it's uh you got to have have the places living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		but uh still i think they ought to know how to use one and it is not just a toy and that when
 		it's not like on TV when someone gets shot uh they get back up if someone gets shot with a real gun they don't get back up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i had to explain that to my i've got a six year old now and and he you know i have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old well they understand now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i've taken time to teach them and now the young boy wants to know and
 		you know like i told him you're a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and you know we'd start with the BB gun deal you know so he started with the BB gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows and i took it away from him i said now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know so he's learning the hard way but at least it was a BB gun not a twenty two or a four ten or something so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh
 		i remember i had an old uncle up by Tulsa Oklahoma that took me out and uh showed me this was it was not my it was my mother's uncle this was a gentleman in his sixties
 	
 	
 		gee
 	
 	
 		and he took me out with him and uh single shot twenty two and taught me how to shoot we went squirrel hunting and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		all right
 	
 	
 		and uh he taught me how to shoot uh an old single shot twenty two and i probably i was probably about twelve at the time and i thought that was the neatest thing at first and Uncle Sam took me out took me hunting with h im and he let me shoot and showed me how
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know i don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away so
 	
 	
 		oh  yeah
 		well that's about all i we agreed pretty well on this i think so okay well it's been real nice talking with you okay bye
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i think so uh
 		all right have a good one bye-bye
