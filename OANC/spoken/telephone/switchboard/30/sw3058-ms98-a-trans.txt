 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay  so what books do you like to read
 	
 	
 		well all kinds to tell you the truth uh  mostly i like uh  um science fiction science fantasy type books
 	
 	
 		like what what authors
 	
 	
 		uh well let me see uh well the most my favorite ones are kind of an old author Edgar Rice Burroughs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he had a uh series of uh called John Carter Of Mars i don't know if you're familiar with it or not but uh he's the one that wrote Tarzan Of The Apes and all that too and uh and uh
 	
 	
 		no i'm not
 		okay yeah heard of that
 	
 	
 		and uh he uh he had one where this guy was a Civil War soldier and and uh made some trips to Mars and stuff i thought it was really interesting  plus i i liked Pierce Anthony uh the one about uh Zanth i don't know if you're familiar with that
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting
 		no i really i have never really never never read science fiction much
 	
 	
 		and well that was more fantasy i guess and uh because it's kind of neat because it has a lot of puns and stuff you know in it and so it's kind of funny too and then uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		then i like uh what else do i have there oh it's a series of another fantasy but it's Fred Saberhagen Saberhagen and it's the it's uh The Sword Series which i liked and uh Gore i like too it's another fantasy one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh starting i think i'm going to start pick up a few uh more science fiction as far as well as Isaac Asimov have a number of his books too and H G Wells
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's older stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah uh but but i think they're pretty good and uh and then i'm i think i'm going to start picking up some of the newer Star Treks because i hear they're pretty good too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i had a professor at school whose sister wrote a Star Trek episode wrote one of those novels that yeah as under this fake name she wrote it in  she's a professor at another university and it was
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		kind of a hush hush thing that she'd written this book so we all had to read it for a sociology class so um no i don't the author was like Madge Larson or something like that it was a kind of feminist
 	
 	
 		do you know which which one was it
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Star Trek people on a  it's the the woman had been a POW in Vietnam who wrote it and so she she's one of the first female POW's and so she had um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kind of paralleled that with kind of a space version of it and it was kind of it was interesting i don't know if it was interesting just because i knew the person who'd written it or if it was actually a good book
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've never really read a lot of science fiction it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i sort of read mostly in high school and uh you know and i and i like it you know as as kind as the light reading and everything and uh i recently uh completed graduate school and i've really kind of got interested
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		through a number a couple of classes that i took there on on history and stuff and i've gotten a number of history books but i haven't read any yet you know uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh  but you've got them so that
 	
 	
 		yeah but i've got them and they're ready to go  that's right but uh i was kind of getting into you know like uh you know like medieval times and stuff like that and just as to just to do some reading about what went on and everything
 	
 	
 		halfway there so that's good
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i've i've read a lot of medieval literature this year in school a lot of like took a class in Chaucer so we were reading in the Middle English and all that and that was a lot of fun kind of weird but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah and what what which ones do you like
 	
 	
 		um well i'm uh i like a lot of contemporary short stories um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		authors authors like Bobbie Ann Mason she's from Kentucky and writes a lot of just kind of contemporary realism sort of stuff um John Barthelme who wrote he just died a few years ago and he wrote kind of weird avant-garde
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		short fiction and then like in the sixties through the late eighties and he was kind of responsible for turning around the short story movement so that was  kind of neat um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if i'm reading kind of trashy stuff i like um i guess kind of mystery books and then stuff that's funny i like pretty much any humor book
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and gosh oh
 	
 	
 		well i've got those as far as humor i've got a couple of Irma Bombecks too
 	
 	
 		oh that's fun
 	
 	
 		yeah and then also there there's another one i don't know you might have read it The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy yeah there's a series well it was a trilogy with four books  and uh have you read those
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		no i i i have one of them sitting on my bookshelf and i just never picked it up
 	
 	
 		do you
 		yeah they're they're pretty funny because it's really kind of interesting and uh uh those are are kind of neat too and i've read uh i like Steve well i like some of Stephen King
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i like him
 	
 	
 		i i'm not really too i don't really like his endings so much but uh i think some of his books are pretty good and then there the other one that i've read a little bit is uh  um oh God let me go look at his name here it's the one that wrote uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i used to
 	
 	
 		um i can't even think of his
 		see oh here oh Clive Barker
 	
 	
 		oh what have you read by him
 	
 	
 		uh The Books Of Blood and uh Cable Cable i guess how you say just you know some paperbacks and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i've never read anything i got a book of his out of the library just the other day to try it out i'd been to England and thought you know he's like the British Stephen King so oh really i'll have to
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 		uh-huh well i like him better than Stephen King yeah he he he's pretty he's pretty good
 	
 	
 		oh well he's next on my list to read i'm reading a little private eye book now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and then of course i've read the uh
 		Clancy books
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know uh Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Riding Rising
 	
 	
 		oh those are the ones my dad keeps trying to get me to read but i
 	
 	
 		well actually you know Red Storm i haven't i've started Red Storm Rising but uh i really recommend Hunt For Red October
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because it really it's good and and it keeps going pretty quick but the Red Storm Rising i've heard and then it's been apparent the first you know few pages or whatever it's kind of slow in starting and everything
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it's not a bad book at all
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting i read i like Moby Dick that's a  that's my big book that i like
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah actually i i i got an old copy of Moby Dick that i like too i read a while back
 	
 	
 		that's one i just my very very favorite book so if i had to go read something again i'd probably read Moby Dick or Scarlet Letter i also like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah oh probably liked Star Trek Two didn't you
 	
 	
 		no i actually have never seen any of the Star Trek movies was that oh well that's interesting i had a roommate in school who did a did you ever see the movie Heathers
 	
 	
 		oh you hadn't Two was really good because he quoted a lot from Moby Dick
 		no i didn't
 	
 	
 		oh it's it's kind of this sort of black comedy movie about this these kids in high school who
 		are not real popular and they kill all the popular kids in the class it's it's kind of bleak but it's sort of fun and they do a lot of Moby Dick i had a roommate who wrote a whole paper on Moby Dick and Heathers and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and well i  i thought it was a little much but it was kind of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like John Irving that's
 	
 	
 		John Irving yeah
 	
 	
 		he hasn't written much in a while but
 		when he does i'm pretty happy with it
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm trying to think what else i've read that i've really just loved
 		i don't know how i it's hard to read when you're in school it's like you just read those textbooks and that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i know and that will have to do
 	
 	
 		but i guess maybe in the real world too you just don't have time to read but
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty much the way it is usually i try to i have some a book or two by the bed and then maybe like i get to read for twenty minutes before i go to sleep or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and then you fall asleep and have to reread it the next night because you forgot what you've read yeah i i do that too oh i like Larry McMurtry he's good and like Lonesome Dove was
 	
 	
 		yep  that's right yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was a long book but it was really good
 	
 	
 		well i understand that Peter Benchley is coming out with a new one yeah i just read an article the other day you know uh because i have this Jaws book here and i think he's going to call it The Beast or something like that it's about a squid
 	
 	
 		really
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so you know whether or not it will be as good as you know Jaws was i don't i don't know
 	
 	
 		i liked Jaws and The Deep and The Island those were pretty good so i would read that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah Jaws actually have have you read the first one the book
 	
 	
 		yeah
