 
     		
 	
 		okay well what do you think
 	
 	
 		it um i'm trying to remember exactly how the question was worded what what
 	
 	
 		women's roles and how they've changed
 	
 	
 		change
 		in the last generation or two
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well one thing and i don't know how how long a span a generation is considered whether we're talking you know twenty years or or or whatever but it seems to me there are more and more women
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's obvious there are more and more women working outside the home some of them of course are finally climbing corporate ladders uh whereas when i was growing up it was either secretary or teacher
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 		oh really are you working outside the home
 	
 	
 		yes i work at TI
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah but i still notice a lot of not necessarily prejudice but i work with a um
 		some men that are very chauvinistic still
 	
 	
 		so do i
 	
 	
 		yeah it is it's it's very hard to deal with because i mean they know that it offends me what the way they act but they do it anyway
 		so i don't know though it's really weird because my i came from a very my family has a lot of strong willed women in it and so i've i've never really
 		you know nobody ever said well you could only be a secretary or a nurse to me i mean you know my my parents were very strong and said you can do whatever you want to do so i got really lucky there but it's real funny i have a niece and a nephew now and my nephew is
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		seven years old and something was said about my niece being a doctor and he said well she can't be a doctor she can only be a nurse  i thought golly you're seven years old and you're already opinionated
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well and probably probably he hasn't seen any female doctors
 	
 	
 		well yeah that's the only thing i could figure because i'm i'm sure that he didn't get that from my my mother or his mother
 	
 	
 		probably not but but on if he watches television if he gets a coloring book the doctor is is frequently
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh she portrayed as a male and the nurse well i'm just i'm just thinking of pictures that i've seen and and you know uh uh i i suspect no no message was ever intended to be while what you have to be this gender
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to do this job but it does sometimes come through and when i said um that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that those were the only two professions folks seemed to do it wasn't necessarily that that was what i was told to do or or whatever it simply that's what i observed growing up was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um about the only women you know it a woman at that time could uh clerk in a grocery store or any other kind of store
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		be a teacher
 	
 	
 		yeah and i went into teaching that was uh what i had started out doing early on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and left that when i decided to get married and leave Texas for a while
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so and i've never gone back to it in the last in the intervening nineteen years it's just uh
 		i i love to teach i don't want to have to deal with the discipline problems and so forth so that's a whole another story
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah my daddy was a that was his i guess second profession he was a teacher
 	
 	
 		uh okay undying admiration comes from me that's that's for sure
 	
 	
 		huh well that's neat well um it was real funny i went to a seminar that was just it was is a satellite seminar it was really neat and it was just for women
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they talked about the Cindrella Cinderella syndrome and i had never heard about that had you
 	
 	
 		uh uh not by that term anyway
 	
 	
 		well it's about how women or not necessarily women but little girls are taught that your prince will come and he'll do everything and he'll make everything right
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um it was really neat because she totally reworked this the story about Cinderella um
 		networked her way to this ball and then  it was really neat it was great the way she turned the story around and said you know she left her calling card in the form of a glass slipper and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		very interesting
 		very creative
 	
 	
 		yeah it was really neat but you know i i hadn't even thought about about fairy tales that they really do leave that impression i'm sure with a lot of little girls
 	
 	
 		well i hadn't thought about it but but very likely i went to a seminar a conference just uh Friday afternoon uh
 		that was put on by by TI but it it dealt with um the minority issues of promotion within the business
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and they had had invited three speakers from uh one from Xerox and one from Pepsico and and another company out of Denver and the these gentlemen were all uh VP or higher
 		were were from minorities but in addition they were also addressing um women or including women in in the entire focus of
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
 	
 	
 		the minority issues and so uh it was a very interesting discussion in the afternoon uh the questions and so forth that that their  three uh uh speeches engendered uh just talking about well how
 		how does your company deal with this and and and so forth and it was refreshing to hear that uh companies are beginning to address the issue of of uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so few women beyond a certain level so few in the board room and and so forth and so they they shared some of the ideas they their companies were had uh instituted as far as uh uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		giving a leg up mentoring processes and so forth that they had in place
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's neat
 	
 	
 		and then one of our VPs shared what what are some of the things that TI is doing to um come up with some similar results
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh well that's neat
 	
 	
 		i'm beginning to find more and more female engineers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		although not um
 		not many of them yet have moved into manager positions that'll part of that's because so many of them are are still real young and they've got to learn the business first and then they can move up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		right
 		well i work in a computer industry also and um
 		i've found very few women that are higher up in the MIS departments
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i i can only think of one out of all the people that i've talked to
 		so it's it's amazing that yeah they're out there but they're just slowly moving their way up
 		but hopefully it will all happen and by the time my little niece gets up there she can  yeah
 	
 	
 		she can pick whatever she wants to be and if she would like to be the traditional Cinderella and find that prince that's okay too but there
 	
 	
 		right oh yeah yeah i don't want here to be neglected of anything like that but
 	
 	
 		yeah but there are other options that are available
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well um i lost my train of thought  no that's okay um well i've lost it
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		hum oh well um yeah it's it's uh i think it's gotten a lot better over the years but like i said i i felt very fortunate that i grew up around strong willed women anyway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so because i i some of the women that i have worked with are so wimpy that you can understand why men get frustrated with them
