 
     		
 	
 		okay where have you been on vacation lately
 	
 	
 		um well the last vacation i went was to Cozumel and that was last uh March and April
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		have you got another one planned
 	
 	
 		not at this point
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		although if we take another vacation i think we might like to go to Cancun this time have you been there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we went there well actually i went there before i got married i haven't been back with Kyle yet but  he is very much wanting to go there and since i have some free tickets with some frequent flyer stuff that's where he wants to go
 		but um also since my parents my in-laws just moved to Utah we're kind of pressured to go up there and go snow skiing and i've never been snow skiing so i'm not really into that i would rather do the beach scene
 	
 	
 		i agree i mean if i'm going to go on vacation i want to lay out in the sun and relax
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		drink  tropical drinks
 	
 	
 		definitely do that
 	
 	
 		and someplace i'd like to go is like to the other side of the Caribbean as you you know as opposed to the Mexican side i want drink rum drinks and uh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		lay on those beaches over there
 	
 	
 		like in the in the Virgin Islands
 	
 	
 		that sounds good another place that i heard is really pretty is uh the Cayman Islands
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		although i hear they're expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah that's definitely true well i got a magazine the other day called Caribbean Life and it had um
 		different charter boats in there where like three couples could could charter a boat and have a crew and everything but um
 		you just pretty much go wherever you want to go and they had great summer rates so like if you do it before September or October or something like that you really save a ton of money and i would love to do that
 	
 	
 		well our tenth anniversary is coming up in October uh-huh yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		oh really i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		i'd like to you even if we just get away for three or four days i think it would be kind of neat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just to do something originally a couple years ago we were hoping to do a trip to Greece
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't think that's going to be possible now
 	
 	
 		um that'd be fun
 	
 	
 		now that is probably the number one place on earth that i would like to go um-hum
 	
 	
 		really
 		wow well all the pictures i've ever seen of it has just been gorgeous but i don't know i think i think i'd
 		there's other places that i would rather go first i think maybe
 	
 	
 		like where
 	
 	
 		um Australia and down in there i mean the the pictures i've seen of that even um
 		oh i had a  when i was in school i had a nun that was from um
 		oh i can't even think of the island now but she told us just wonderful stories of the island and and the pictures she showed us and all that i can't think of the place now it's a pretty big one oh Venezuela
 	
 	
 		i don't think that's an island but that's okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh i wherever she wherever she was she was out you know on the edge but anyway she uh had some great pictures and i always thought that would be fun to go there and they have great beaches too
 	
 	
 		well the main place that Nick would like to go is uh Rio
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum he's been talking about that for years
 	
 	
 		hey that would be fun yeah when i was little i always heard how romantic Rio was but i would like to go to Tahiti too that'd be fun
 		but even just like in the States it was fun when we went to Mackinac Island that was pretty cool
 	
 	
 		that's uh up in Michigan yeah we talked about doing one of those drive around trips you know you drive around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess Lake Michigan and then you take the ferry over to the other side and um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but i'd only want to do that in the summer
 	
 	
 		yeah because it i was there at the end of July and it was still pretty cool
 		so yeah i'm not not a cold weather person at all
 	
 	
 		no neither am i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well um um um i think that uh once we get the house refinanced we're going to probably try to take our free tickets and either go to Cancun or
 		do the little uh trip to California Southern California and then on up to Utah
 		so i don't know we'll see
 	
 	
 		well Nick just got back from San Diego last night and he said it was absolutely gorgeous and i haven't been there since i guess it was seventy three
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and uh i'd love to go back that was just one of the prettiest places on earth i have ever seen
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i'm going to uh work in a business trip and go to San Diego
 	
 	
 		how do you work in a business trip
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you'll have to ask Bill how my business trips work
 		
 
 		they work very well  and i have definitely needed a business trip lately
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well since you already set up the office out in Southern California there's nothing left for me
 	
 	
 		well that's true hadn't thought about that
 	
 	
 		and it doesn't appear we're going to be opening any new offices
 	
 	
 		well they could get really big though and hire a secretary and then you could have to go train
 	
 	
 		that'd be all right
 	
 	
 		yeah tell them to do that
 	
 	
 		i guess we're straying from the uh the vacation part of it
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 		but i mean a trip is a trip
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right i'll go anywhere
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh i would too in a drop of a hat fortunately we aren't tied down with uh any other little two legged responsibilities we can go
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you can do that yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah makes makes a big difference
 	
 	
 		as a matter of fact i was offered a free ticket air ticket today if i want one
 	
 	
 		well take it
 	
 	
 		well
 		eventually i might but Archie offered me a ticket um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well good
 	
 	
 		and uh i thought we'd you know i wouldn't want to just take it but he has American and a couple of other ones and he said they just go to waste
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i Nick's going to New Orleans in January i think next year i haven't been there for so long
 	
 	
 		ooh i love New Orleans
 		oh yeah
 		such good food
 	
 	
 		and drinks
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  well and even just to go sit in the bars and listen to the jazz that's so much fun oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah or watch the people or the hookers go up and down the street
 	
 	
 		oh God yeah that's the first time i ever saw an actual transvestite i think was in New Orleans
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i saw them in uh
 		San Diego i went to a shore a show you know one of those transvestite shows
 	
 	
 		really
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that was something
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i guess i'll go take my shower i've been working out so i'll do that
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well i'll talk to you later
