 
     		
 	
 		what was one of the latest ones that you've seen actually
 	
 	
 		oh i guess i think we rented Pretty Women a couple weeks months ago
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right the last two years i have done more theater movie going than i have actually watched videos at home i've uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh become available to come and go more often so i said hey it's worth it i'll just go at the matinee hour and i can see what i please
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no more costly than renting one the last see i went about two or three weeks ago and saw FX Two
 		and that is a really good movie if you like special effects kind of gory and lots of you know action
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh who's in that one i don't know if i have even heard of that one
 	
 	
 		um
 		do you know that i don't follow performers i don't follow actors some i know some i don't um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		and he was the guy the guy that played in it he wasn't the star but the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in uh
 		oh
 		the one about the old people
 	
 	
 		Cocoon
 	
 	
 		the Cocoon uh-huh he was a blonde haired heavyset alien
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		in Cocoon
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't know what his name is
 	
 	
 		uh i think i know who you are talking about though
 	
 	
 		yeah at any rate i also saw not long ago Once Around that was with Richard Dreyfuss
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and that one was just a very poignant story it it it had people it was it was
 		you know a lot of people said it was a really funny movie but it was a very it was a poignant humor and there was it was like uh uh Steel Magnolias the characters played very well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		off one another and there was humor involved but the story was a very dramatic story
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i enjoyed it very much
 		what are some others that you have seen lately
 	
 	
 		oh i'm trying to think uh just the other night on HBO we watched The Hunt For Red Red October again and that's one that
 	
 	
 		oh whoa yeah that's one i can watch over and over and over again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i was going to read while it was on but then when it started i just couldn't you know read that was a really good movie
 	
 	
 		it sure was and you know the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it there are a number of good movies like that
 	
 	
 		yeah there's quite a few uh movies out now that i would like to go see my husband is not a real big movie goer and i guess more than anything that is why we don't go plus by the time you get a babysitter and then pay to go to the movies
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it just gets pretty expensive
 	
 	
 		right you don't work
 	
 	
 		no i stay at home
 	
 	
 		okay well you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		go during the day that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		that's right there's nothing wrong with that go in the early hours it's a matinee it's not crowded the uh the price is as reasonable as renting a video
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's the way i do it and i go quite frequently if you are going to be planning on doing that now i was Warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a uh witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was i was very well persuaded to walk out
 		very well persuaded there was more gore than i was interested in seeing but then the movie settles down to a comfortable action uh i can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh the action was comfortable and of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things so i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore and there were some others but they were done a little more tastefully
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh in the first scene the Warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet and i could not handle that i said whoa i'm glad i have not had dinner
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		then uh i saw Awakening that's a wonderful wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro
 		uh
 	
 	
 		Robert Robert De Niro yeah okay i think you said Peter yeah
 	
 	
 		Robert De Niro what did i say Peter i said Robert De Niro and he has done a really good job of characterizing
 		the uh disabled person and of course Robin Williams always just has a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing even when he's sad you know you have great faith that he will get happy again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then oh let's see there's a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos i guess i can wait another month and they will be videos
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		one is Silence of the Lambs i've heard a lot about that one they say if you really want to be
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you really want some suspense that's the one to see and i understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well you know i think i read about that too
 	
 	
 		um-hum  and then Thelma and Louise i think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie
 		it's about time for one of those i want to go see that and i'm going to try to get in Dances With Wolves
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh you haven't i've heard that is wonderful and
 	
 	
 		um-hum i've heard it's wonderful too but i it's just that they are both very long uh movies and the matinee starts before i get can get away from work and after after that i get involved in other things and don't want to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		don't want to go back
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard that's we uh we uh rented the other one i was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately uh was Presumed Innocent with uh
 		Harrison Ford i guess he's in there and i thought that was really good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you know i saw that and i really
 		i cannot remember too much about it
 	
 	
 		it was the one where he was a defense uh not defense he was a prosecutor prosecutor and there was a murder of one of the women that was in the the DA's office
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then he ended up being accused of it
 	
 	
 		oh that's right i remember now yeah i remember
 	
 	
 		yeah so i mean it really kind of had a turn at the end when you found out who it was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum well i've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies i think he ought to stay Indiana Jones
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i realize that he would like his career to develop but i don't want to see him in other things
 		
 
 		but uh i tell you Sean Connery in the Hunt For Red October i i never did care for him as in the James Bond movies i don't know he was too
 	
 	
 		i was never into those movies either but
 	
 	
 		i yeah i didn't care for the type of movie but he was always slick and greasy and seemed to be conceit ed and had more women than he needed and  i didn't like him but he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older i thought
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought he looked real good with a beard too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah he does and there is just a there's a
 		i don't know uh i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not and he he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and i enjoy those and i enjoy i enjoy some of the Michael J Fox movies i didn't care too much for the last one either it just was not enough to it uh
 	
 	
 		what was the last one i'm trying to think uh the last like Back to the Future then was the last one
 	
 	
 		no no no it was called uh  Hard Way where he was an actor trying to portray
 	
 	
 		oh okay trying to be a cop or something yeah
 	
 	
 		trying to portay a policeman
 		and uh that
