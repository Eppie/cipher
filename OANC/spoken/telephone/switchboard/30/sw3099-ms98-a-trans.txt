 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so what were you saying
 	
 	
 		do you work with do you work around children when you work with computers
 	
 	
 		no no not at all i work with computers
 		yep they what one thing i
 	
 	
 		okay do you have but you have friends that have children
 	
 	
 		i have some friends that have children uh not that many actually
 	
 	
 		that have been
 		uh-huh what is child care like in New York what is
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i do not really know
 		excuse me too much about child care in New York
 	
 	
 		does the company you work for have child care on premises for the employees
 	
 	
 		excuse me one second
 		huh-uh
 		no not at all in fact my situation is a little bit strange i was uh a student for many years and then graduated and went and worked in France for awhile
 		have just come back and was doing consulting work so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now uh and and i might
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my
 		a sabbatical
 		well i hope you can stay as long as possible with
 	
 	
 		yeah well hopefully i can do some consulting work at home and if i can do that it will yeah i'll be able to spend the time with my daughter and not have to worry too much about child care
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh that would be wonderful right
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh i might start to go crazy with it too it is a little i i miss the intellectual stimulation
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but at the same time i really it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now and
 	
 	
 		i think it does when when they're real little and they're changing every day there's and you just miss the little things and and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		yeah
 		well i think for me the important concerns i do not think i would put her in day care for joint situation right now unless it was like one other child with a with a person
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't want her to be into a in a large day care situation so young because i think a little infant just doesn't get the stimulation they need
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		maybe if if i needed to work part time like four hours a day i might do that because like you should get enough stimulation from me the rest of the time but uh i just think that you know when there's two year olds running around
 		the whoever is taking care of them the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds and only when the infant screams are they going to go there and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know i play with her most of the time she's awake and i think that is so important
 	
 	
 		right well that it is important for the bonding that they do it with the mother this is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well such as things for learning gives the child stimulation i think is important
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		our oldest grandson when he was eighteen months old went into a a Montessori day care system and they took infants starting at six weeks and they have a program uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in that was devised by this Montessori person and uh a certain type of stimulations and there's times of day that even when the child is awake that they they lay quietly
 		and look at certain things they keep deliberately keep the room not real bright and and uh they have different things they'll they'll put them down on the floor and of course they never have more than like five
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and they'll put them down on the floor and they will have oh i think one of them was a little mirror and some were just different objects that have had a definite purpose for kids you know and there's something about their eyes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well she's she's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she's you know
 	
 	
 		uh how old is she now oh yeah
 	
 	
 		she's two months now nine weeks and she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that and she's just started that like yesterday or the day before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so every days are different and i think that you know i think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'll probably be going back to work around January whereas she'll be about eight or nine months old and so i think you know she'll be at a i have heard it's a roughage to put them into a
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 		it is because that's when they're clinging to mama so you might have a real problem with that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying so it you know it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place but that's unusual
 	
 	
 		but but i think it
 		yeah we're just going to have to see how things work out uh but i'm trying to you know leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to go to a movie and things like that so that she's used to other people taking care of her
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is it your parents or your husband's parents
 	
 	
 		my parents my husband's parents are in France so it's a little bit harder but during you know she she she's met them already
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		not that she will remember them but she's met them
 	
 	
 		right right that's nice when uh i my i have three grandchildren another one coming in September and i it would if they were
 		where i couldn't get my hands on them i'm afraid i would probably go crazy i you know i i like that but if it you do not have to put them in child care that's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		are they all nearby
 	
 	
 		that's an ideal situation for you is to stay with them as or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time that's that's wonderful for the child
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but right and you need to look at when you if you do decide to go with child care you really need to to
 	
 	
 		well if i work part time that might be doable
 	
 	
 		look at what your options are and and look at the what they offer drop in at times that
 		are unexpected the
 	
 	
 		yeah well right now the situation is so tight at many places that it's even hard to have a choice
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		incredible but you know since this is people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids  and you know i just find that incredible and my sister-in-law is going to have a baby very very soon and she's intending to stay home with the baby
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you know maybe do some freelance type work from home and so if i go back to work on a part time basis i'm hoping i can leave my daughter with her because her daughter you know again will be a couple
 	
 	
 		oh that would be wonderful
 	
 	
 		my daughter will be about six months older than hers and you know it'll be a little rough when she is a very very little infant but like when she is a month or so my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with babysitting for large families and so uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day and we could might even be able to do it on a trade off basis that i watch their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever or if she wants an afternoon off even if she wants an afternoon just to work
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		right
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and not be bothered we might be able to exchange that way
 	
 	
 		uh -huh
 	
 	
 		and so we'll just have to see how things work out but i think the whole you know ideally i think the
 		businesses should have the day care centers there whether it's the parents who take turns watching the kids or whether they hire a couple of people and uh you know parents come down to supervise or whatever
 	
 	
 		i do too
 		really well trained people right and have have some kind of real good program set up so that you when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows CPR or first aid or
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and and have some kind of program set up like you say to stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner and have the you know the right toys and the right setting and
 		uh have a an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule you know that's real important to little kids
 	
 	
 		yeah well she's my daughter doesn't seem to be on a real schedule yet and it's  probably my fault because i do not have a real schedule now but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh they they adjust to what the parents
 	
 	
 		yeah well she's been staying up late at night and  you know sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		we you know that works until they start school and that's a problem society is geared to a a day person and it's
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i have uh another friend who's brother and his wife have done this they stay up until all hours of the night
