 
     		
 	
 		okay i guess we're ready to go uh what are your favorite types of restaurants
 	
 	
 		okay
 		we enjoy uh various types of restaurants uh there's some excellent Italian restaurants here there's some good Cajun cooking of course there's always steak
 	
 	
 		and barbecue right
 	
 	
 		and barbecue right
 	
 	
 		uh do you eat out quite frequently
 	
 	
 		oh not as  much as we used to but uh still at least about once a week
 	
 	
 		really and where's the last place that you went to eat
 	
 	
 		let's see we ate at Louisiana Purchase up in Plano just recently we had a craving for catfish and uh they have some good catfish there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we enjoy there's an Italian restaurant over in Garland also called Taste of Italy i don't know if you've tried any of those there's about four of them around town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		but it's good home style Italian cooking it's not the fancy veal and things that you get at some of the other Italian restaurants
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they make excellent spaghetti sauce and little garlic rolls and things like that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i also recently we had Jacolya out at Addison cajun cooking
 	
 	
 		okay uh what areas do you usually eat in do you find
 	
 	
 		north Dallas and Richardson and Plano area we live out near Richardson Square Mall
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so it generally in that north side of town
 	
 	
 		do you ever get down to Deep Elm or Greenville or McKinney
 	
 	
 		yes there's an excellent uh i guess it's Tai it's one of the Southeast Asian type restaurants down in Deep Elm uh West Wind or
 	
 	
 		i've heard of that i've heard several people say that so it must really be i think it's part Vietnamese or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes i believe so i am really not sure exactly what style it is but it's very very good
 		now right in the edge of North Dallas there at uh Skillman just north of LBJ there's another Vietnamese type restaurant called Yoli's Y O L I S
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		which uh serves some excellent food too in that in that style of food
 	
 	
 		so what would
 	
 	
 		it's not a fancy place i've eaten their lunch primarily
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  um so what is your favorite restaurant in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh that's hard to say but the ones that we like most are out of business now but
 	
 	
 		unfortunately everyone else didn't like them quite as well right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		right but Papillon is one we go back to quite frequently for uh continental style cooking
 	
 	
 		we haven't tried that one i uh we belong to the Passbook uh Club
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so we tend to use their coupons whenever possible and i know that's in there and i'd like to get over there
 	
 	
 		i think you would enjoy it it's a tad on the expensive side uh probably run uh with dinner and uh some drinks about twenty five thirty dollars a person
 	
 	
 		well when you have a half price coupon it's not quite so bad then
 	
 	
 		it helps quite a bit right yes we have used some of the coupons also at some of the places but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that is i think one of our favorite our our most most favorite restaurant was LaLouve which was here on uh in north just off of Central Expressway in north Dallas but that's been gone several years now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh well it's just a shame all the restaurants that you know open and close you seems you go to one and find one that's your favorite and the next thing you know it's gone
 	
 	
 		it's gone right it's
 	
 	
 		well i heard that there are more restaurants per capita in Dallas than there are in New York
 	
 	
 		that doesn't surprise me
 	
 	
 		i know it's they're everywhere people eat out in Dallas like i have never seen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we we've enjoyed it the there've been some excellent restaurants here through the years and of course some go up some go down and uh it just depends on the chef in some cases of course
 	
 	
 		yes
 		have you been to the new Sonny Bryan's down in uh uh West the West End
 	
 	
 		no i haven't uh haven't been to that one
 	
 	
 		well i have not been to the old one for that matter but i thought that since there's a new one opening perhaps it'd be easier to get into
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well again the the old Sonny Bryan's up there by uh what is it by uh Methodist Hospital
 	
 	
 		is it like over on Lemmon or something okay
 	
 	
 		up on Inwood uh yeah that one is not really it's it's it's a it's a barbecue stand really it's not really a restaurant
 	
 	
 		well that's what i understand you sit at school tables or out on the hood of your car and um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's right they make some really good barbecue there
 	
 	
 		well that's fine for the summer but i don't think i'd be too interested in the winter
 	
 	
 		right
 		but uh i used to live work over on just off of Stemmons and we'd go over there about once a week for barbecue for lunch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		there's uh oh there's
 		a lots of good restaurants here i think the really hard thing is you want fresh seafood of course uh we're a little bit away from the coast not as far as Kansas but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i'm from Saint Louis so believe me it was harder to get in Saint Louis than it is here
 	
 	
 		you're right yeah yeah
 		but uh for seafood just all around good eating seafood Vincent's has some really good seafood
 	
 	
 		you know i go by that place all the time over on Midway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well there's several there's one in Plano one on Midway there's one over by Love Field i think
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		there are three or four of them here in town and we've gone to the one over on Midway and also to the one up in Plano matter of fact let's see we were there New Year's Eve at the one on Plano
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we'll have to try that sometime because uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you'd really enjoy it
 	
 	
 		well we went to or i i went to Ralph and Kacoos for lunch one day and i've heard good and bad about that The Guide always reviews it very poorly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but what i had and then uh the two guys i went to lunch with they both let me taste what they had and it was delicious
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we had dinner there we have a group of friends we go out once a month with and we had dinner at Ralph and Kacoos last fall i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we were there and it was excellent the night that we were there
 	
 	
 		well you know how these restaurant reviewers are
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i think their tastes are jaded
 	
 	
 		it depends on whether they got  the meal or not
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i guess we probably have talked about our five minutes worth
 	
 	
 		i think we have i certainly enjoyed talking with you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well and i've also written down the Taste of Italy we'll have to try that sometime
 	
 	
 		uh you'll have to try it don't expect anything fancy
 	
 	
 		that's all right with me
 	
 	
 		it's home style food it's not expensive and uh get the dinner salad with the olives on it
 	
 	
 		okay and do they have good lasagna
 	
 	
 		so
 		yes my wife swears by the lasagna
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay okay okay because that's my husband's favorite
 	
 	
 		yeah they have excellent lasagna and if you get like spaghetti with uh get with the Italian sausage it taste like home made Italian sausage you'd get in Chicago
 	
 	
 		okay great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		thanks for the tip  bye-bye
