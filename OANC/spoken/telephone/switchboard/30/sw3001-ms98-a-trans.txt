 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		are you a TIer
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		is somebody in your family a TIer
 	
 	
 		no uh my fiancee works for the computers for the government and that's how he got it
 	
 	
 		oh okay so who do you work for
 	
 	
 		i just graduated from college
 	
 	
 		so you don't have any benefits at all to talk about
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you're just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or what i'm looking for
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay well in in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		didn't get that far you normally just try to sell them on your uh aptitude and not you know well how much vacation do i get oh well
 	
 	
 		no
 		um
 	
 	
 		well i'll tell you a little bit about what TI has as benefits we do have uh like most companies we have medical insurance
 		although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more um what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to um
 		set hospitals in the area they call it network hospitals they're hospitals
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i've heard of that
 	
 	
 		yeah they're hospitals that they're uh agreeing with uh TI that they'll be a certain rate you know for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep costs you know costs down
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors so it's almost like a um uh an HMO
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know kind of thing that uh only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage if you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we have some dental coverage now um but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile Like i've had a couple of crowns recently and
 		if you didn't have the extra dental plus um you only get like a third of your cost which can be kind of expensive with a crown so i i pay
 	
 	
 		yeah it can
 	
 	
 		yeah i pay for the extra dental plus so much more per month
 		because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um we do have pension although i've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good and i know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that
 	
 	
 		oh i like to think about that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		after you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go is that all that's in there i don't think's it's going to pay too long when i get out
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago um
 		it's not an i R A it's called a four oh one K plan it's kind of like pension you put in so much money and then TI um meets you half way up to a certain maximum so like i put in a dollar they put in fifty cents so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that grows pretty good and i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		course you can buy stock in the company but you know that's not always a real for sure kind of thing course
 	
 	
 		not always safe
 	
 	
 		yeah especially with this one you know it kind of goes up and down i don't know if it's any different than other companies but you hate to have it fluctuate and like
 		you know last year it was forty dollars a share and now this year it's thirty six dollars a share and you go gee i'm losing money  doesn't quite feel as good
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and we get you know vacation normally after you're here for six months and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you
 		and it's one nice thing about TI is after you've been here uh for five years you get three weeks
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		which
 		a lot of places make you work like ten years or so before you get that much
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we get some we get uh decent holidays um we at Thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice to make a nice long weekend and at Christmas we always get two days at Christmas
 		they float it around depending on which day of the week Christmas falls on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's nice so you always get two days at Christmas a lot of people just take you know that week i normally take that week somehow you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you only have to take three days of vacation and you get the whole week at Christmas time
 	
 	
 		yeah well um i can just tell you like you know from my dad and my fiancee like my dad well there's twelve kids in my family
 	
 	
 		whoa okay
 	
 	
 		so uh the the dental was very important you know to my dad
 		but um i think they took the dental away now he worked for United Telephone System it's you know it's just another you know telephone network
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they took the dental away but now i think they're going to start getting into eye
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i think uh um i don't use the services but yeah i think sometime last year or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage you get discounts on uh glasses and
 		i'm not quite sure there's certain places you can go to that have uh discounts for people that work here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah and now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock
 		but my fiancee he's on that same kind of pension as what you said
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		only for everything he puts in they'll match it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		up to a certain amount
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a dollar
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and then he's only allowed i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know if it's maybe five percent
 		or something like that that he's allowed to put in and they'll match it
 		so and um he works for the did you ever hear of the National Bureau of Standards
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		okay well he works for them they changed their name now but that's that's where he works and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he his vacation is really nice he's going to be there three years at the end of this month and he'll be getting three weeks vacation
 	
 	
 		gee that's pretty decent
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah okay you know of course it's it's for the government and he has all the holidays off
 	
 	
 		right and you get some extra ones federal workers always seem to get you know you get Columbus Day and Veterans Day and those ones that you couldn't really care about so much but you get the day off anyhow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah uh-huh he has it really nice it's nice where he works and um he seems to be very happy you know
 		like his hospi talization and you know he has all that and with his doctors and stuff they have um a list of doctors that the employees can go to
 		and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor
 		you know and i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any
 	
 	
 		oh yeah okay
 	
 	
 		but you have to go you know to certain ones but still that works out really nice you know
 	
 	
 		yeah we're doing an HMO right now um and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars
 		so but so you know sometime sometimes when you go you know the prescription like my husband always takes  which is kind of like you know contact stuff only better um you that's like a buck a capsule
 	
 	
 		that's not bad either
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings then there's other times that you know maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than like seven or eight dollars and you pay five anyhow
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it isn't a percentage but sometimes you work you know you manage to make
