 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		hi you want to start first
 	
 	
 		of course we're talking about the elderly and uh whether or not we would we like nursing homes and as a matter of fact i can tell you something about that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		you apparently have somebody there in one
 	
 	
 		no actually my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years and her mother
 	
 	
 		oh you are kidding
 	
 	
 		no she did and then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home for years and then uh went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		i will be darned
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses
 	
 	
 		oh for heaven's sake
 	
 	
 		so i do know something about that
 	
 	
 		you are very very much aware of what goes on  that is great
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 		actually the motivation for grandmother entering the business was that her mother was very old and couldn't seem to find companions
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		she was lonely and she needed company for her mother and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies and then uh it it grew into a very prosperous business from that point uh then they
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		i will be darned
 		um-hum
 		now see that is a nice attitude to go into uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it seems like they must be waiting until it's a necessity
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there is no chance of uh good companionship or doing anything
 	
 	
 		well that is not really true either uh i think that is a stigma and an i and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences you see those who had bad experiences talk about them
 	
 	
 		um right right
 	
 	
 		and those who don't may write a letter to the nursing home and say you did good but they do not talk a whole lot about that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		that is true but what i mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when you are still able to have good relationships with maybe other friends
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		sure well now
 	
 	
 		they wait until they're you know unable
 	
 	
 		that's right well that is because they wait until the children make those choices they choose to not make those choices themselves however my daughter-in-law also is a nurse in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh she works for one here in Dallas which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home and these these i love watching these elderly people come they will come and tell her well i am going for my tennis lessons
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh would you would you you know call down and have the van come around and take us for our tennis lessons and they're very active and very enthusiastic and they have some excellent programs right there on site
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		their dining room looks like you know Luby's Cafeteria
 	
 	
 		yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		or or one of the lovely cafeterias and they have you know pink linen napkins for their dinners and a a well equipped library
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah that sounds great
 	
 	
 		oh i am certainly very much for a nursing home and i think when the the parent gets old enough to the extent where they just don't want to be bothered with keeping house and with taking care of themselves anymore that is a wonderful alternative it is expensive it is costly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		see if they could could get this idea across though better than what it is
 	
 	
 		it is costly
 		um-hum
 		well now my daddy's mother uh lived in a a retirement village and she and her sister had side by side duplexes one bedroom duplex she still had her individuality
 	
 	
 		you know
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but they were there close and they did have uh you know the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems and there were lights that you could flip on and so forth and they he did have security
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		no i am very much in favor i have heard horror stories
 	
 	
 		oh well you have that with anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know that the elderly can easily be abused but i would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are they are in homes of their own children
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		in the homes
 		yeah well we used our nursing home as uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		like when my sister was real bad before she died uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we took her the last month and a half into a nursing home and they were super with her
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		they were uh
 	
 	
 		well now my grandmother of course all of my folks lived to be very old and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease when she was in her late eighties uh late seventies i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she went to the doctor she had surgery she got the treatments and during the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments
 		she was in a nursing home she got better she got well she got out and went dancing again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		well a lot of people do that they left them temporally maybe they had a broken hip or something or
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right
 		uh-huh uh-huh i think it is a wonderful interim place it is a place that you don't have to struggle with hospital problems and uh yet it is not you know you have
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum um-hum
 		and it can become home to them
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum it certainly is
 	
 	
 		it it it depends upon the individual right yeah
 	
 	
 		it certainly does but you see we have had excellent experience with that and uh i
 		i did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill but i would not object to going to one i might i might like to be uh coherent enough to make my own choice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i would not particularly think i would want my kids to say well i think this is what i need for Mom and then dump me there but i would like
 	
 	
 		this this is the age and  there has to be consideration taken on everything so
 	
 	
 		that's right um-hum um-hum and i think you would shop for a nursing home just like you would shop for a church or a doctor or anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right you would look into it thoroughly and do do the best job you could in choosing choosing one
 	
 	
 		um-hum sure
 		um-hum when you get to the point where you are in trouble and you have got to have that help you are in no position to make those choices
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no and you do not have the time to look that is what i am saying most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		um-hum
 		absolutely i think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they're going to be needing those facilities one day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service go out to the nursing home help guide some craft programs perhaps work on some music programs whatever their talents are and work with those senior citizens
 	
 	
 		whatever their talents yeah
 		yeah i have a cousin who's uh  he had a son that was epileptic from birth and he did fine at home they lived on a farm
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but she made arrangements so that when she was gone she didn't want her her children her other children burdened with his care
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so he they she has made arrangements that when she she was gone that he would go into the nursing home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he's i would say he adjusted very well and uh he he he's been there quite a long time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh he don't know me usually  but he goes wheeling down uh the hall to bingo somebody else he's helping him out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know and uh he has adjusted very well
 	
 	
 		well one of the things i think that is most desirable for the elderly and that is routine
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh yes yes
 	
 	
 		routine and uh constancy
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over i do not think they pay the nursing home staff sufficiently to to get the dedication
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh to keep them there uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that they have in some other profession and that's sad because i think the health profession is one of the most critical
 	
 	
 		true
 		yes yes but for for some reason
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		people resist uh the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing you know
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		it seems to be a resistance
 	
 	
 		care for the elderly and care for the children i can't imagine a more costly and a more a more uh better area to invest your money
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right right but there seems to be a resistance
 	
 	
 		you're preserving your heritage and your future there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and as a matter of fact i don't see why they don't have children's programs in nursing homes
 	
 	
 		well around here we have some you know the churches
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh take your the children and
 		i know our kids thoroughly the children thoroughly enjoy
