 
     		
 	
 		okay well i worked out today
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i didn't
 	
 	
 		you didn't do you do you ever
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i end up being um
 	
 	
 		a lot
 	
 	
 		we're fixing to go on vacation so i'm running here and there and everywhere and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah well that's a workout in itself getting ready to go
 		huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it the the recorder came on i went oh boy do how do i miss today because i thought if i'd be there right now
 		i couldn't have taken this call
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so my guilt feelings come rushing through but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you go every day
 	
 	
 		uh usually yeah i try to um go to i have a membership at Fitness Fitness and Figure World here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		is that is that male and female
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah mine is just female i'm too big of a wimp to go to the male and female
 	
 	
 		well it's it's it's kind of like oh your split-level house its got the male stuff on one side
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		uh and then it has a Nautilus equipment that male or female can use
 		and then it's got your aerobics room which is coed and then it's got the female side which has all their Nautilus that they can use by theirselves and their own sauna
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do a lot of the guys do the aerobics
 	
 	
 		uh no not most of them most it's mostly female
 	
 	
 		just mostly female
 		have they been have you done the bench bench aerobics yet
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the steps
 	
 	
 		do you like it
 	
 	
 		i'm still not sure about it yet
 	
 	
 		yeah i've a
 	
 	
 		um i yeah i'm too busy concentrating if i'm going to twist my ankles or something yeah
 	
 	
 		fall off the bench
 	
 	
 		yeah because i have broken both my ankles so i'm real leery about
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i read an article that it's really not that good on your knees
 	
 	
 		stepping and looking and
 		well i didn't i don't know how it could be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i haven't i haven't ventured with that yet
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm thinking it may be just a fad and will pass with everything else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but in our classes there's a ton of people that do it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and they do it i think they only have it like three times a week because i think that's what they pretty much recommend but still uh i think that would be so hard on your knees
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		and you know the boxes get pretty tall and i um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i haven't got to the tallest one yet and it hasn't
 		the i did uh when i first started it bothered my knees behind my knees
 	
 	
 		huh that's strange
 	
 	
 		that's the only place i was sore and i thought well i must not be doing them right or
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or something because that i have no need for that muscle back there
 	
 	
 		yeah really i can't ever think of when you would use that huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		so i'm you know i can see where it because it effected my knees
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and i did regular aerobics like last night with without the boxes and i got more of a workout
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was a no bounce class
 	
 	
 		yeah oh really
 	
 	
 		and i still got more of a workout as far as in you know stamina etcetera
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well i was a cheerleader for a long long time so i don't get into the aerobics at all because it's too much like cheerleading so i mostly just ride the bike and do the weights on the machines
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i do they have aquacise which i like that quite a bit
 	
 	
 		Now i've been to that i haven't been to that yet uh i've i've it just it just doesn't move fast enough for me i don't think
 	
 	
 		yeah well i mean you know it varies from instructor to instructor but if you get a good one you can get a pretty good workout yeah
 	
 	
 		i've got to have something hyper
 		really
 		i've never tried it so i guess  i've i ought to try it before i think it's not fast enough
 	
 	
 		well yeah you'd think with broken ankles that would be a good way to go because you don't get that friction when you land
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		huh  well
 	
 	
 		i've never
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess i ought to try i don't know it just never appealed to me as much as as
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as uh just for real hard aerobics does for some reason and and then the weights and i'm really and and then the weights and i'm really um like in the the step machines
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah that's great do you is it a Stairmaster
 	
 	
 		uh i'm not sure what it is
 	
 	
 		because see the one that we have isn't Stairmaster so it's not quite as good i don't think but um it's it's real good for you but boy they say that you're supposed to go twenty minutes and i can't do that
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		i've been trying to work up to it but i can't
 	
 	
 		oh when they first started me i had a girl who was training me and she'd only been there three weeks and she says well you just push this button and you turn the dial and you just go and i'm like
 		one side would go down and then the other side and i thought i and these guys on each side of me are just pumping it like you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i'm going there's got to be something wrong here and the guy looks over and says he's got you started on ten
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		so let's turn it down and then i was keeping up with him you know but it was funny because i thought
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i am like in slow motion compared to everybody around me what i and i felt like way out of shape and it just happened to be the dial was wrong but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		you mostly go the evenings
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i attempted going in the mornings and it was really good because then it was out of the way and you know and nothing interfered but it's just so much harder to get up that much earlier
 	
 	
 		yeah i am more i used to do i used to run in the mornings
 	
 	
 		oh i hate running
 	
 	
 		and in i'm just much more stretched out by the evening
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		from work and everything because i was really having uh backaches and stuff when i'd get halfway through the day i couldn't figure out why
 	
 	
 		yeah i hadn't thought about that
 		yeah
 		huh i hadn't thought about that well my other problem was i'd get to the club and i'd be getting ready to go to work and i'd realize i didn't have my blouse or something
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so that was always kind of traumatic
 	
 	
 		yeah it could be of course i don't know it could be great for business
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i wonder i did i literally went in one day in my linen skirt and a sweatshirt
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		so anyway well enjoy your vacation
