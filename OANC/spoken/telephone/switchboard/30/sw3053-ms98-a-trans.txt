 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what magazines do you subscribe to
 	
 	
 		uh the only one i subscribe to well i did subscribe to two i subscribe to INC at the office
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then i get Cosmopolitan at home
 	
 	
 		oh that's kind of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah it gives me a little variety anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's fun that's kind of fun well we have like every magazine in the world my dad is kind of a chronic magazine subscriber he gets uh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		oh gosh Bird Watcher Digest and i mean just almost  anything any interest he ever has for like a week he will subscribe to the magazine of it
 	
 	
 		wow
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so we have got every magazine that that there is and then i get uh New Yorker because i like the the literature in it and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh uh i read Newsweek and US News
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like Newsweek
 	
 	
 		yeah they are always real interesting i remember even in high school that was one of our assignments to read Newsweek and i kind of got hooked on it then and then um through college then i kind of had too many other things going on
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		yeah i understand when i first got in college my dad
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		set up subscriptions for all these magazines because he could get them at the student cheap rate that we had
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		tons of magazines
 	
 	
 		that's neat well do you spend a lot of time reading them or do you just pick out what you want
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i pick pick out what i want usually
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		read uh  read those cartoons in the New Yorker read the little synopsis find out who died in Newsweek and look at like celebrity pictures and i'm not
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the best informed person i guess but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh you know if there is a news name that you don't know you can flip through the Newsweek and try to find who it is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that is a little bit helpful but
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 		well um i read the INC magazine mainly for my company my company it's not my company personally obviously but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we have been selected as INC's top five hundred for the last two years yeah so it's really it's exciting to see your name in print and they do um
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the other things that i read are kind of they are all computer related because that's what my company is about but um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they are not really magazines they are periodicals but i do not know if they would really qualify as magazines i guess so because they have advertising and news print so
 	
 	
 		right are they like PC World or beyond that
 	
 	
 		yeah that stuff and Mainframe Journal and Computer World all that boring stuff but it's stuff you got to keep up with or else you you start falling behind
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right i know
 		yeah
 		that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and then yeah it's real funny because my husband um gives me trouble still about getting Cosmopolitan and because that's mainly or not mainly but i think he thinks as it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as more of a single girl's magazine type of thing and i am like well i am going to get this until i start getting like
 		uh Better Homes and Gardens
 	
 	
 		really until you start getting those old magazines that
 	
 	
 		yeah i can't see that
 	
 	
 		Retirement Digest
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i said that i'll keep subscribing to a magazine until i started wanting to get Reader's Digest and then at that point if you just cut it off
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 		and Parenthood and
 	
 	
 		really Golf Digest it's
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		these are the bad signs
 	
 	
 		i can't see any of those
 	
 	
 		so i don't know where i don't what we do with all our magazines we probably
 	
 	
 		you recycle them
 	
 	
 		cut down all all well we do we take them to the library and they sell them there you can not recycle the shiny paper of the magazine
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we recycle everything but the
 		paper of the magazines go back to the library and they resell them which i can't imagine who would want like back issue of Newsweek but
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i guess maybe there are people in the world
 	
 	
 		all those people doing all that research
 	
 	
 		that's right people can get them and have their children do craft projects cut the pictures out and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well when i i was doing some research for a product i was doing at the office and i went to the library and read the magazines on the microfiche which was really pretty neat
 	
 	
 		oh
 		which is bad i don't like those microfiche i
 		i we had this last year of school i had my last paper of college and i am writing this paper on Bette Midler i was decided i was not going to be very academic finally and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you had to look through all these old periodicals and use microfiche and i just got seasick the little things zipping by your face so it was
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just thought i was going to throw up right there in the library it was
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		not a good day
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i guess i went slow enough that it did not make me nauseous
 	
 	
 		yeah well they have like the the automated machines now you just press the button and the
 	
 	
 		oh and it zooms
 	
 	
 		words just go zipping by and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i do not think i could do with that
 	
 	
 		it it's bad uh
 	
 	
 		but it was really neat cause i was doing this this project i had to read American Demographics which you know i had never even knew that magazine existed but it had some really neat stuff in it
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah that's um we did a lot of demographic stuff at school
 	
 	
 		huh i was amazed i did not know that kind of magazine was even out there
 	
 	
 		i know it's something you never thought you would care about there is perhaps a magazine for every interest in the world
 	
 	
 		yeah cause even like in the grocery store you know i do not ever go over and look at the magazines but i was getting some pictures developed at the grocery store and it was taking longer so i was hanging out over there and i was amazed at the different kinds
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yeah there is it's a lot out there we have Modern Maturity that was the worse mom and dad dad turned fifty so we got Modern Maturity
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like this is not good
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it has all these like health tips and ways to fix prunes and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh God
 	
 	
 		what a good magazine
 	
 	
 		oh that would be awful
 	
 	
 		so yeah and so we are
 	
 	
 		i do not know what my parents get i think uh my dad is retired Army so i know that they get something along those lines
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh and he is real big into genealogy but i don't know if there is any genealogy magazines
 	
 	
 		oh no doubt there is i am sure i'm sure of it
 	
 	
 		really yeah well that is probably true i had not thought about that
 	
 	
 		their's i never knew all the specific things they had in magazines
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they are fun though i mean at least it kills time while you are at the doctor's office
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know really all the try do the word find in Highlight magazine
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah i was real surprised though my doctor carries tons of magazines i mean he has like Tennis World and i mean stuff that normally i mean a doctor's usually have US News or World Report and People magazine and that is about it
 	
 	
 		right my doctors have the worst magazines i
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		have to change doctors but then i might need to get that
 	
 	
 		you want my doctor's name  well i mean if you get that many at home you probably would not want them
 	
 	
 		i know um we're not at any loss for reading material here you you pretty much you can read like the table of contents before the next one comes and then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		i bet you are you're
 	
 	
 		that there is like a big pile these are the magazines we are going to read sometime and so it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah your mailman is probably not real happy with y'all huh
 	
 	
 		no i uh no  get we have the jumbo truck that comes by our house to drop off the mail
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		it's a mess but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's okay we keep the publishers  magazine publishers in business
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		in the midst of the recession we're
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		supporting America's publishing economy
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's what a friend of mine um was getting the Wall Street Journal and she wasn't taking the time to read it so she just had this huge pile and we were like what are you doing saving up for a puppy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		really
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		line a bunch of bird cages
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		with that
 		okay well i guess that's about all on magazines nice talking with you have a good evening sorry to interrupt your dinner  bye
