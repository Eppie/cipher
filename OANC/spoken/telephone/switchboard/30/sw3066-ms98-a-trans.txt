 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what kind of pets do you have
 	
 	
 		i have two miniature Schnauzers
 	
 	
 		oh how cute are they very old
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um one of them is just a year old and the other one is four
 	
 	
 		oh so get got one with a lot of puppies still in it
 	
 	
 		um-hum i am afraid so
 	
 	
 		do you train them did you train them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh somewhat
 	
 	
 		do can they do tricks and stuff
 	
 	
 		well a little bit i am mainly i just like them for companionship and you know they they they can retrieve and that sort of thing but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i don't teach them to do dancing or anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well my husband thinks he's married to Ellie May Clampitt
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yes we have four dogs and lots of fish and then uh where i live i have some wild rabbits that live outside so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i consider them my pets too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i go out and talk to them and give them you know things out of the refrigerator i do not know if they ever really eat any of it or not but uh my dogs are mainly just mutts they are they are all big though they are like half Lab and half Collie
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so i have big dogs and i had never had big dogs until i got married i had a little toy Poodle as i was growing up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and my dad had bird dogs but you know i normally i was used to having a little puppy that i could hold and snuggle and boy these big dogs are something else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		but you know what it surprises me my neighbor has um Dalmatians and they want to be in your lap just like puppies do
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah that's what one of my my male dog thinks he is a lap dog but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's real funny because we have a water bed and one of my dogs is afraid of the thunder and so when it thunders she hits the water bed and like catapults you up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's a real treat
 	
 	
 		yes i'm sure it is you just never know where you are going to be do you  oh
 	
 	
 		no but it's real funny cause she's just big and she's real ferocious but boy if it thunders she is just like a little baby
 	
 	
 		hum
 		that really tames her down quick doesn't it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's real funny i got a book on you know how to train you dog to keep from being afraid of thunder but golly i had to quit my job and stay home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		that's interesting i i had a a miniature Schnauzer um i've always had them well since the early seventies i really like the breed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um but my silver one i had to put to sleep a few years ago but now she she was afraid of thunder but she would go into the main bathroom which is surrounded by the house there's no outside windows or anything okay
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i guess she felt safest there but she'd crawl into the bath tub
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		um-hum whenever there was thunder and lightning and then i felt just bad for her because she would shake even thought she was in there but there was not much i could do
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but the other the the puppy i got after that which is the the four year old and then um i bought a mate for her to have company and uh the young one that's a year old
 		they do not even notice it when it thunders and lightning huh-uh it does not bother them a bit
 	
 	
 		really
 		that's good
 		do they play get along real well with each other
 	
 	
 		um-hum very well together yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's what my uh Dr Jim Humphrey's i watch his show sometimes and he said that dogs are pack animals and so they are a lot happier when they have a buddy to play with
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah and i always felt so guilty leaving the one by itself you know and of course with your four
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah they have they have a big time
 	
 	
 		yeah  oh that's great
 	
 	
 		but it's really funny cause i mean you know obviously nobody plans to have four dogs but uh my husband had the two and then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		shortly after we got married the couple behind us had a dog that they just were tired of and they were going to have her put to sleep and she was just gorgeous and we said no we will take her and find her a home and we did
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you kept her
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and then the little one that or the the last one i guess i should say um my husband saw her get hit by a car so he loaded her up and brought her home thinking we'd find her a home and we did
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because right now i am so attached to all of them i could not get rid of one if i had to
 	
 	
 		i know well they sound like they are real fortunate to have found you too you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah they are real fun we take them pretty much everywhere i mean we have to God it costs us a fortune to board them
 	
 	
 		oh well sure it would
 	
 	
 		but um we go camping and they go with us and we have the best time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well how do you maintain any decorum around your house
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's difficult
 		um they are all black and so i told my husband i said boy next time we are either going to get a black carpet or blonde dogs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i said
 		this is just too much and then people say when are you going to have children and we are like well when we start getting rid of dogs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my i have a neighbor we live on most of the lots out here are a half acre to an acre
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and they have five and what she's done is she sees them along side the road stray or something she will bring them home
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and her husband finally said that's enough you know we can't have any more
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it's amazing i have gone over there and the majority is they were two two large dogs and they're outdoors and the other three were in the house but you would never know that she had dogs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she must scrub the floors every day
 	
 	
 		well my husband vacuums a lot  especially when they are shedding
 	
 	
 		um you almost have to
 		that's why i had the miniature Schnauzers cause they do not shed yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well now my dad just got a Schnauzer but i do not know i guess it's not considered miniature because um it's what i consider normal size
 	
 	
 		they have the standard and the giant  and uh i understand i've been to dog shows and i have seen them i have not been around them but i understand that they are very gentle animals
 	
 	
 		oh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		even even so they are so big
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh the only thing that
 	
 	
 		well how big is big
 		i mean like the size of a Collie big
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i believe the the standard are the size of a collie and the giant gets bigger than that if i am not mistaken
 	
 	
 		wow
 		oh
 		well then what daddy has must be a miniature too because it's
 	
 	
 		the miniatures are usually about fifteen inches high yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's how my are and then you know even though they are miniature they can be large for their size or small for their size
 	
 	
 		huh well have you ever seen a Schnoodle
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i just love they were so cute
 	
 	
 		yes um a member of my family has one back home yeah they they are real cute
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well the first time i saw one i just fell in love and me and Kyle just said like no we can't have any more dogs  i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		come on now get serious right that's enough is enough uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it just kills me to go i can't even go into a pet store because i want a puppy so badly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so it's real funny all my girlfriends say yeah everybody else is saying i want a baby and Jackie is saying i want a puppy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i don't know if you if you have ever had a litter but it's a wonderful experience yeah um the older one that i've got she's had two litters and it is so much fun
 	
 	
 		no
 		really
 		oh wow
 		oh but i just couldn't bear to give those puppies away
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it oh listen i raised three of them i kept three until they were about four months old i just could not part with them and then you know i had to
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i didn't think i would be able to sell them when they were three months old but it was amazing i have a i have an enclosed patio and so that's where i kept the dogs and there's a doggie door they can go in and out into the backyard that's fenced so the mother trained the puppies
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really well that's neat
 	
 	
 		yeah to to go in and out and it's real interesting to watch how they they take care of one another and how she corrects them and and when they they fight like kids and she will break them up it was just really neat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it was it was quite an experience and i wanted to the other one that i have is black and silver and i wanted to have puppies with her but she had a medical problem and i had to have she had to have surgery so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		she is not able to have puppies but she's and don't don't you
