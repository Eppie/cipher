 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well we uh taxes
 		everyone thinks taxes are too high i'm sure but uh i think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases
 		what do you think
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i i think so i i
 		uh
 		i i think i'm i think i'm uh
 		a little out of the ordinary in that that i i uh
 		i think i'm more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than uh a lot of other people are and think that we need to we need to
 		either raise our taxes or or cutback on something and i don't know what to cutback on to to get to get that to get that settled and and uh
 	
 	
 		at this stage it's hard to tell
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i know i'm a real a real uh out of it in terms of taxes so i'm not i'm uh think that the we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh for Texas and and
 	
 	
 		well at this stage i think we've taxed property almost to the limit because like the the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		because of the cost of the taxes on them i know i live in Richardson and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but now we're getting public services the schools the hospitals and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there uh look what the schools could cost you
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah now i'm uh uh oh i we'd when we moved to Richardson Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the uh for the schools and and realizing that that
 		that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to uh to go for that because we supported the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		then again the the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent and the public colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh one of the uh i believe i don't know which one it is uh down there whether it's Hobby or uh
 		the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition well if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah that would provide uh
 		possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things see the so called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i pay eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even
 	
 	
 		i i don't i don't know about that i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah  well i quit ten years ago so
 	
 	
 		i i see okay no uh
 	
 	
 		i couldn't afford to start again
 	
 	
 		yeah well that that that would be true that would be true but
 	
 	
 		i know uh my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but all the various taxing authorities that come through i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime
 	
 	
 		yeah and and even if it is isn't going to uh uh
 		provide you with any any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know
 	
 	
 		well this this is a thing i think it's like uh back east you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities you can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it
 		if we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and uh construction costs were cheap you could afford it but now digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and
 		yeah and the other thing is that when it when it's the public transportation is established that early on then then the business uh
 		business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that whereas in in uh in Dallas here we've we've got uh
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		those patterns were well established before before we really tried to tried to do the DART and uh
 		
 
 		for instance all the all the the uh
 		office buildings and stuff that are out here in in uh north Dallas as opposed to downtown uh to try to to try to provide
 		efficient transportation from everywhere around the the metroplex to to
 		uh both those centers of of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there
 		as opposed to having a concentrated business area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know like New York does yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere new York and some people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		someone made the analogy uh with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street well most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm just as guilty as anyone else
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i drive to work every day by myself uh without even even any thought of car pooling
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		and uh most people are that way
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		because they're used to not having public transportation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but i here again i think the thing i resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so and doing all these studies and the things we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i felt that was a little uh wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying
 	
 	
 		a little bit much oh yeah yep
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yep we could
 	
 	
 		well that's about all i can say at this time
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i think so i think that will probably do it so
 	
 	
 		okay it's been real nice talking with you
 	
 	
 		good enough bye
 	
 	
 		bye
