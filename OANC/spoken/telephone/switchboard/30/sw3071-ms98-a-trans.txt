 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i guess we're supposed to talk about music
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh let me go ahead and push one here
 		
 
 		uh do you have are you a musician yourself
 	
 	
 		uh well i sing i don't play an instrument though
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh where do you sing in in a choir or a choral group
 	
 	
 		oh not right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what kind of singing do you like to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh pretty much anything
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh Um are you uh are are have you have you been singing a long time or have you studied uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah a long time out all through college and everything i was in the choirs
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i've had some classical vocal training um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh great did did you do that in uh Texas or somewhere else
 	
 	
 		no i was in Europe
 	
 	
 		oh whereabouts
 	
 	
 		in uh in Germany
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh that's wonderful um well i likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs and
 		then i didn't sing in a choral group um until after i was uh married and i sang in a couple of uh community choirs and then  um
 		waited for a while and now i've for about the last eight years i've sung in a church choir here in Texas and um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i i enjoy just the chorals singing a lot as well Um are you a soprano alto or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		soprano
 	
 	
 		a soprano yeah so am i do you and uh what kind of music do you like to sing um you were saying you had classical training do you have a particular composer that you like or a particular type
 	
 	
 		oh well as far as opera goes i'm i think most fond of Verdi
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i've been listening to um some um some advertisements for Madam Butterfly and i'm wondering if you if you have ever done anything like that have you ever done any uh if if you had done Madam Butterfly
 	
 	
 		no no i haven't done um
 		i'd love to but
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um that's uh Puccini i think right
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes uh-huh
 		um Madam Butterfly was um in Dallas it's been two or three years ago now and then i went to see that and it was really wonderful it was particularly well the acting was particularly nice i thought and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it was quite popular um you don't play um an instrument so ah
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh um have you ever wanted to like guitar or piano or
 	
 	
 		uh i think it would be nice if i played the piano
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that i think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does you know some other kind of instrument i think piano is always good background beginner Um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i played piano all through well i guess from the time i was five five until i graduated from college and uh then i was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school so um
 		that was the instrument both of my children started on but neither of them stayed with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		one of them um turned into a violinist and the other one is the boy is um guitar and and percussion so um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but the i i think that the piano background is very um useful and um i'm sure that it for you it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself just for practicing and so on
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you have any other kind of music that you like
 	
 	
 		um oh i like to listen to all different kinds of music
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i have a i used to work with a fellow who had um although this was a computer company he had his uh PhD in musical uh i guess it was in composition actually from University of North Texas and uh
 		when i would go into his his office every now and then you never knew what kind of music he'd be playing on the radio
 		It may be country it might be classical it might be rock you know it was just he said that that just about what you said that he just liked all kinds of music
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that was that was neat for for me to hear that somebody is
 	
 	
 		there's you know some of the really totally country stuff i don't really particularly like but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um do you have any plans to uh do anything with your music in the near future or
 	
 	
 		well i have i have like we i wish i could but i i don't really know how to go about it without having a degree or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i know that there are if you're interested in choral singing i'm not sure where you are in Texas but i do know that some communities have uh
 		uh community choruses and uh that's often a good way to get back into it again um it's not really terribly demanding you might have to audition but that probably wouldn't be a problem but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there usually you know that they take tours and things like that and you get to know you know people um socially as well as as in a musical setting so that's always fun i think that's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's one reason why i have enjoyed my choir so much is that not only do we sing wonderful music but we've gotten to know each other quite well um
 		in on a a social level and i think we sing better because of that i think you know i think we sing more like uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		people who trust each other  which is really nice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so whereabouts in Texas are you if i could ask
 	
 	
 		oh i'm in Flower Mound uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Flower Mound okay well i'm in Plano so um we're just not too far apart actually
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty close
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it was funny um  um it's you know i talk to people all over uh Texas um and only one person outside of the country uh of the state so i'm always asking where where in the state you know the person is from if they're in Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um are do you have a family
 	
 	
 		um i'm married
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i was wondering if your if your spouse or if you know if you had uh other musical people in your family
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		uh if you have other people in your family who are also musical
 	
 	
 		oh a little bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you come by it naturally was your were your parents that musical yeah yeah that often is the case um
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		the you know it's it sometimes it will skip like my husband is not musical at all but his mother is very musical and um and his children are very musical so  you never know where the talent is going to show up i guess sometimes
 		so um  well i'm not sure how long we've talked i haven't paid haven't been paying attention to the to the clock but uh
 	
 	
 		i think
 	
 	
 		i'll bet we've done we've done at least five minutes
 	
 	
 		probably
 	
 	
 		well i 've enjoyed talking with you uh Becky and um maybe we'll talk again uh-huh bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay
 		all right thanks
 		bye-bye
