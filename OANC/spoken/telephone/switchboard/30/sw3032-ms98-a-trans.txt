 
     		
 	
 		here we go Jay
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		uh can you give me your ideas on uh what you think about the budget
 	
 	
 		well on the budget i'm not for sure i wouldn't um
 		start off first of all by putting a limit on the
 		members of congress
 		and then maybe we could get some new people in there to work on it
 		but other than the budget i think they just have to uh
 		i don't know i think they have to just have uh maybe um
 		uh almost a like a constitutional convention and get sharp people from all over the country to come together
 		try to decide what we're going to cut i think we cut the wrong areas and
 		and just maybe start all over again
 		almost like family sometimes i have to do this call time out and then
 	
 	
 		yeah  i guess some of the states had had started started out like uh
 		California i think i think they had is it proposition two and a half they had out there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and Massachusetts had the same type of of uh legislation you know they only can raise taxes so much there there's a cap on it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		see down here in Texas they just they don't state they we don't have a state income tax and so they never want to raise taxes so they just raise the fees they just call them fees and there's a fee for everything
 	
 	
 		you don't have a state income tax
 	
 	
 		we don't have a state income tax and uh there's no uh the sales tax isn't on food
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		or anything like that so we
 	
 	
 		yeah our sales tax isn't either uh it's a
 	
 	
 		yeah so we're not taxed very much uh but the fees are pretty pretty ridiculous
 		but i think we just may need to have uh you know get sharp people from all over the country
 		into some sort of a like a constitutional convention and then to say what's working in one place why wouldn't it work someplace else i noticed Bridgeport Connecticut's declared bankruptcy
 	
 	
 		yeah isn't that something uh yeah it was just in the paper the last day or two
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so
 		yeah and it happened i think Michigan way back in the late sixties when Soapie Williams was governor they declared bankruptcy the whole state of Michigan
 		so it's
 	
 	
 		yeah it's just they're just running um
 		i i don't know about about Texas but i know up around here as soon as uh like Massachusetts well Rhode Island too it doesn't make any difference which state when things get tight they always
 		threaten they're going to cut uh police fire uh they're going to layoff teachers but they
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's the rank and file they never talk about cutting at the top you know the administrators and the assistant to the assistant to the assistant
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 		absolutely absolutely
 	
 	
 		and i think the federal government is the same way that it's it's just gotten so huge that i don't think anyone
 		has got a handle on it anymore
 	
 	
 		no by leaving
 	
 	
 		there's no
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah by leaving that particular group in there to make the decisions it's not going change
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so somebody has to get it to where that it's just a rank and file citizens around the country and and the and like a
 	
 	
 		that's right that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		like a huge convention you know if they'd send uh
 		so many people from each uh um they could do them they could do them in the state by state and then each state could pick representatives just like they do at uh political conventions
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		but you'd what what it would end up it would be the same old people going so
 	
 	
 		that's  probably there should be uh uh a mandatory limit on on how long you can serve like maybe only two terms
 	
 	
 		yeah that's i've always thought that
 	
 	
 		and that's if we you know because some of these old boys have been in there for a thousand years
 	
 	
 		get in get in there forever and then that seniority system and then the
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		some creep in there and uh so um
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah it's probably going to have to start there and get some new blood in there and then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um maybe they can look at it and they can you know each one of them that's in there now have got their own favorite projects and all you know they're they're cronies and
 		um but i don't think you can do anything i don't think they're i think the budget's out of hand until you can get in there and change the administration and i'm talking about right through from top to bottom
 	
 	
 		right i think uh well even at the beginning of the country Alexander Hamilton wanted to put a limit
 		on um
 		the the President was only supposed to serve seven years and they didn't uh they didn't follow through on that but i i've i've thought about a twelve year cap for  congressmen and senators
 		and maybe go back to a seven year term for the President
 		sort of you know
 	
 	
 		it so it would run
 	
 	
 		could you hold one second just a second Ray
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hello
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's all right my wife's a psychologist and i thought that might be somebody calling in for her
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		how are things in Massachusetts after Dukakis then
 	
 	
 		um Massachusetts Massachusetts is in is in terrible terrible shape
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they're uh uh they're still talking about uh
 		uh laying laying off a lot of people you know cutting cutting a lot of services um the state is not funding any of the any of the cities and towns so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so the cities and towns now are are forced to go out and uh raise capital uh it's it's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah this is Texas is trying
 	
 	
 		it's just a bad situation and it's not only there but Rhode Island is the same it's just isn't there you know it's in the same boat
 	
 	
 		oh that's crazy because Texas uh it looks like it's trying to bounce back a little bit but it's we've still got a ways to go
 		it's uh i teach in a college and i and i'm in a i'm in pretty good shape but some of these uh there's just a lot of people out of work lot of homeless
 		and the budget is just i don't we've got a new governor democratic democratic governor female and uh
 		she's trying to cutback but she has to be so careful and that's the problem is that you if you come in too fast
 		you can't get reelected
 	
 	
 		yeah you know um there's an awful lot of people uh in this country that are idle uh when you say like the homeless and there's the prison population is skyrocketing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		uh i think they should probably go back and borrow some of uh Roosevelt's ideas you know uh set up some of these CCC camps like they had way back
 	
 	
 		yes yes but
 	
 	
 		um that
 	
 	
 		you know give people a little uh dignity because i know a lot of these people would like to work they just don't know how uh to go out and get find a job or they're not skilled or or something and it  it doesn't take a lot of skill to rake leaves or
 		do some of those things like those
 	
 	
 		that's right they could they could uh they could build roads uh bridges uh uh canals uh there's there's a ton of things they can do we can take in uh they could stop start uh a rapid transit
 	
 	
 		right right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		movement like when they when they first broke into uh
 		uh the interstate highways
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh we don't have a rapid transit system in this country though worth a worth a damn
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no we don't we don't  the um we and you mentioned the prison prison population another thing you can do in the budget we've got a lot of people who don't need to be in prison
 		i mean there's some of the lesser crimes anymore probably you don't need to put them away put them in some work program
 	
 	
 		that's true right
 		yep
 	
 	
 		you know a minimum very minimum security and this they've got a job and you you work uh
 		you know work this long some of them may find that they they like it and want to take it permanently then you could just switch them over in another branch of that and pay them um
 		a decent wage you you'd whatever you'd pay them would be a lot better than having them in jail or having them out on the street
 	
 	
 		that's right because i don't know what what it costs per year per inmate
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a lot
 	
 	
 		but
 		if they just if they just like paid them a wage and let them perform something useful
 	
 	
 		yeah
