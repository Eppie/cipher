 
     		
 	
 		okay i'm back on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um you say you watch evenings mostly
 	
 	
 		i watch evenings because i work all day i used to watch daytimes um mainly like All My Children that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		oh so
 	
 	
 		and then sometimes Oprah and sometimes Donahue but now it's mainly evenings
 	
 	
 		do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		which ones
 	
 	
 		i tape Thirty Something and L A Law those are the two i like the best
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's a
 		oh two they're going to change well one they're taking off i don't know what's going to happen yeah we like L A Law we don't watch Thirty Something but that's kind of young for us my husband and i are grandparents so we don't watch uh
 	
 	
 		i know it's going to be history i know
 		uh-huh
 		oh well well
 	
 	
 		that type of show but we like L A Law we like that we're just i'm sorry they're breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i know i'm amazed
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure i like the new ones too much
 	
 	
 		huh-uh i'm surprised that i was surprised at the ending of you know with all the funny things happening and
 		different things
 	
 	
 		i just wonder if if uh they just want to go on to
 		other projects and not be
 		stuck in this show since it's gone on for so long it looks like it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show of course i guess that's not bad Alan Alda did it on MASH and
 	
 	
 		i know
 		i know isn't that funny
 	
 	
 		it hasn't hurt him at all so do you do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour
 	
 	
 		oh i don't usually like stuff that continues that's why i'm surprised i like those two shows because usually i like you know stuff that just ends sort of that you just you don't have to have watched you know
 	
 	
 		in one hour like Quantum Leap  that's one of our favorites
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean you don't have to
 		yeah you don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow so
 	
 	
 		right which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention
 	
 	
 		you know i usually don't like that
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's always a bummer too sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one
 	
 	
 		i know
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we we do that sometimes i i guess i'm i'm not into real heavy stuff L A Law is about the heaviest thing i watch i i'll mostly i'm into it for relaxation
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so i like things like Golden Girls or Cheers or uh Monday night is real good with me you know Major Dad and and uh uh Northern Exposure and and uh oh what's that one with Burt Reynolds
 		that type of show is what we what uh we watch we generally just stay on one channel all for all of Monday night just to watch those
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just uh some of the times they're continued but mostly they're just little vignettes a new one we found we really like is that Dinosaurs have you seen that that is it's it's really funny they use
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		like animated it's not like a cartoon but it's like dummies and things that are used and uh it's really um and robots probably but uh there's always a a moral to each story
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and what night is it on
 	
 	
 		well you we watched it the times we've seen it it's been like on Saturday or excuse me Friday night uh but it's we've only seen it a couple of times but it
 		it's real the first one we saw um uh they were uh it it involved a tradition
 		of when a person person reaches seventy five uh and i can't remember what day they call it but but uh
 		the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff  anyway
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		anyway it it goes on you know and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all and then when it comes time for him to throw her over well the the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and she said no you can't do you know he ran her out was running to hide in a wheelchair to hide her and she said you can't do that uh this is
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		tradition this is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the the cliff and uh he said i don't understand it's it's real funny that they give the teenagers
 		the as the one that questions um the what's going on and uh in the end of uh the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the the son the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says no you can't do it and then and then uh oh well we've got to do it it's tradition and the son was you know why and so in in the end he doesn't throw her over and of course the town thinks he's just terrible
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh he doesn't
 	
 	
 		because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and
 		he's broken it and then we saw one where this there was a teenage
 		when a boy teenage boy comes into his manhood they call it the night of the howling or something like that and they all go out and howl you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and the son refused to do it he he did he thought it was not no he wouldn't go howl so all the all the people that worked with the father ostracized him
 	
 	
 		so he didn't go howl
 		oh how funny
 	
 	
 		it is it it it's it's real interesting to watch the show and and what the relationship between the family is is really now the mother-in-law
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them so it's our our grandson our oldest grandson is the one that that got us to watching it but it really is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it moves real fast it's a real short and there's always like i say a moral to it and right half hour that that's all there is to it and and uh they
 	
 	
 		it's just a half hour or is it hour
 		oh
 		there's not many half hour shows it seems like that much
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it they they're trying to liken the the father in there of the teenage son to like Jackie Gleason Show uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth and i guess maybe there are some parts of that but i didn't really see that in there but what i've read about it they
 		talk about that but anyway we've we've enjoyed that and and uh i guess mostly i i like the news shows too and the news magazines like Sixty seconds Minutes or Twenty Twenty or
 	
 	
 		yeah no i watch those if i around
 	
 	
 		Prime Time Live or something like that you know all all of those shows if i if i can do it but my husband likes to watch uh
 		old movies especially war movies or or uh sports which i'm not
 	
 	
 		oh see i like sports
 	
 	
 		no i don't well i i do i like ice skating and i like uh gymnastics
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and some track and field but i i and i'll watch snippets of baseball games and i i just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i don't ever no matter what's on i don't ever just sit and watch TV i'm usually either doing dishes or i may be sewing or you know i always have or letter writing or i may be working around in the room somehow but i don't
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		i don't ever just sit and i that's something that comes from your old age you know idle hands are the devil's workshop no it's it's uh
 	
 	
 		no i don't sit
 		i know who has time i don't have time to sit i know
 		that's why i don't get to watch that much i mean i watch nine o'clock i do okay because the kids are all in bed but before that i really there's not much time or like at six thirty i'll watch Wheel of Fortune or something like that
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		right well our yeah if our grandchildren if our grandchildren are with us that's they have to watch that we don't watch it unless they're here  but they uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh no i like that no i'll watch game show kind of stuff but
 	
 	
 		it's it's um oh and you know the the kids will get you started on stuff like America's Funniest Home Videos  we've wound up sending in one that's something i didn't think that we'd ever do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		did you send one
 	
 	
 		yeah our oldest grandson pulling his tooth he's he's he wouldn't let us pull it and i mean it it got to the point he was eating a pear here and he bit into it and it was just hanging by a thread
 	
 	
 		how funny
 	
 	
 		and i and i'd tell him you know it's getting ready to fall out and he walked around the house with his face face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldn't let anybody pull it
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and he wound  he wound up pull
