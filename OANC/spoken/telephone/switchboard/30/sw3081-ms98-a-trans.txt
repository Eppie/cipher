 
     		
 	
 		okay well i i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess if i was having a dinner party i depending on the number of people i might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a chicken dish
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i guess i usually plan
 		probably a lettuce salad and a
 		a potato dish and we usually serve fresh fruit and uh then make a dessert
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		so that makes
 	
 	
 		um we're not uh real wealthy at the moment last time i had people over for dinner we had lasagna
 		and i used my mother's recipe i really like it it's got um you cook the noodles and
 		make and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it and
 		i'm not sure she even puts
 		must be some Italian spices in there i can't remember but um for the cheese part you mix uh sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese
 	
 	
 		well that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and uh layer all that and it's good and then then uh uh tossed salad and
 	
 	
 		that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and um  oh my goodness Diane get down from there  and uh
 		let's see what else did i  serve with that corn yeah i made French bread with that one too i have a recipe that's  pretty good for that
 	
 	
 		bread do you have bread to go with it
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		oh well lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've heard you know i've heard a lot of people say
 		uh it short cut on the cooking for lasagna they they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna
 	
 	
 		i've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		in in fact i think i had it at a  at a party once it was good yeah
 	
 	
 		did you well i i know people that have have served it and they say gosh if you have company coming
 	
 	
 		easy
 	
 	
 		where you don't want to be always in the kitchen it's easy and she said it's they said it's good so that that's always sounds good to me um i feel like i feel like i'm in the kitchen cooking a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i cook  guess i cook a seems seems like i cook a lot of dinners so uh not always for company just for just for family
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so feels like i'm often in the kitchen
 	
 	
 		not my favorite place but
 	
 	
 		but a time consuming place to be
 	
 	
 		a necessity
 	
 	
 		yeah right right so
 		what
 	
 	
 		let's see what else do we like to have for
 		trying to think what else i like to serve
 		my mother likes to serve taco grandes
 	
 	
 		no i don't know what that is no i don't know what that is
 	
 	
 		have you ever had that
 		you take a flour tortilla and you fry it like a taco shell and you uh for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some um
 	
 	
 		okay right
 	
 	
 		tomato sauce in it and and i like to just add Picante sauce to get the  Mexican flavor so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff  and then um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		let's see and then and you heat up refried beans and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese
 		and what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the beans on first then you put the meat then you put the grated cheese and then you put um
 		see what's next  then and i i usually put the cut up tomatoes next
 		and then the um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		lettuce and you can put uh like guacamole
 		and  Katy i'm on the phone well get a towel or go change i'm on the phone
 		um
 		oh a little sour cream is good and and chopped olives
 	
 	
 		right
 		right do you like to make your own guacamole
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we've
 		we don't make it very often i guess but uh
 	
 	
 		no no i don't very often usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain so it yeah i just cut slices off and i like an avocado sandwich too
 	
 	
 		oh do they gosh
 		oh gosh
 		oh that's good that's good or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh well we made i made guacamole that i would take to a pool party across the street the other day and and everyone there
 		said they never made guacamole salad
 	
 	
 		what you want  uh where do they get it
 	
 	
 		so
 		well i don't know i guess they don't have it at home
 	
 	
 		i can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to i guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe
 	
 	
 		they must they just said they never had it at home so i i was concerned that i oh taking this you know taking this
 		as a dip i thought gosh you know sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly so i just
 	
 	
 		yeah it helps if you it helps if you leave the pit in it
 	
 	
 		oh does that help
 	
 	
 		yeah if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing especially while you're waiting before you serve it
 	
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		that's supposed to help keep the
 		um keep it from turning brown so quick
 	
 	
 		well i'll have to remember that well i just i that day i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top and it really stayed longer than i ever thought it would so i thought maybe that was the trick
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's good
 		that probably helps too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so oh well i guess we bought  a lot of we've been buying turkey lately instead of beef so even though you know the ground turkey it's
 	
 	
 		do you want it
 		oh yeah we have too
 	
 	
 		the meat is softer and i everybody seems to like it  so
 	
 	
 		do you want scrambled
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we've
 		most sometimes it seems to be cheaper too so we often buy the we buy the
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah if you get it on sale
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so we bought that or we bought the the fillets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets and i don't think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them so or in
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i don't think mine know either in fact we've been getting lunch meat that's turkey too it costs less than the other and
 		i don't know there's supposed to be something more healthy about it  poultry instead of the beef and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		less cholesterol less cholesterol yeah right right well i guess that's probably all we need to do for today
 	
 	
 		pork yeah
 		yeah i i can't think of any other specific things i like to serve
 		um
 	
 	
 		i always like dessert
 	
 	
 		one sa lad that we always like
 		my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners is a
 		i don't know what you call it
 		uh you mix
 		um
 		cottage cheese and a package of JELL-O and a thing of uh like CoolWhip
 	
 	
 		right right that's always good probably probably the only family recipe that we
 	
 	
 		that's good and quick and easy
 	
 	
 		we make and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake and we take a  recipe from my grandmother and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's probably fairly typical  cream cheese and egg and sugar in the insides but the
