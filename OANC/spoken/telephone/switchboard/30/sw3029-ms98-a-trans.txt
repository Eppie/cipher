 
     		
 	
 		okay well i'll start off being controversial i'm in favor of it
 	
 	
 		that doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial
 	
 	
 		well it seems to be in the current situations but uh i still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now
 	
 	
 		well i think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence
 		need to be reevaluated i think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all crimes against children is one of them
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah i think that
 		oh definitely any any crimes against person
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i feel uh there should be more than a slap on the hand and being sent to prison and being released in uh two or three years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		actually i would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in Middle Eastern countries if you steal you lose a hand
 	
 	
 		ooh yes that's yeah
 	
 	
 		you know uh  if you kill you lose your life what's wrong with that
 	
 	
 		i don't see a thing wrong with that i believe that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		well it's just an an example i think there's uh someone that's on trial right now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		here in the Dallas area and they were interviewing the it's a a young lady was killed sometime back a a young girl
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a personal trial and the reporter was asking a sup stupid question of the people outside well how do you feel about this
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they you know i  thought that's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how do they feel about it i'm sure that uh
 		they want it over with and they want the person punished and punished properly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		deciding what that proper punishment is is one thing i think that there should be no way
 		i i realize that innocent people could go to uh what is it lethal injection now
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		innocent people could do that but for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty
 	
 	
 		yeah well i feel like the the cost of someone someone was quoting figures made the cost at like thirty thousand dollars a year
 	
 	
 		uh the
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum to maintain a prison inmate that's right that's stupid
 	
 	
 		to keep someone in prison
 		and well the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases there are more and more instances
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's right
 	
 	
 		being on the news where this individual was out on the streets on probation or parole and killed someone else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		or seriously injured someone
 	
 	
 		well i don't have solutions to the problems but you know you have these this would be nice if and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory but i think that if you
 		did something for example to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living i remember a man drove by
 		randomly shot a women in the head while she was driving blinded her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate i think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes indeed
 	
 	
 		or the family of an individual
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh who has been harmed you're you you know
 		people who kill policemen policemen who are killed in the line of duty they may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman but that family still has no provider
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well here again anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind
 	
 	
 		and i
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the opportunity exists for someone to get killed
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		now i'm not in favor of gun control
 		to the n-th degree or anything because uh
 		there are uses for guns which are non criminal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them uh aside from domestic disputes husband shooting wives or vice versa
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but these individuals if they have a gun with them i think that the the sentence should be even longer than if they don't
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't agree with the length of the sentence though i think expediency is the answer
 	
 	
 		well
 		well but here again uh if a matter of expediency part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years there should be some uh i know there's a law i believe that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i think that automatic appeal ought to take place
 		uh within a reasonable length of time say six months
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a decision be made and not drag out
 		in the courts
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for years because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities there might be
 	
 	
 		that's right technical i think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals
 	
 	
 		right there's there's got to be a there's got to be a time limit
 	
 	
 		you you you can appeal it once
 		i think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is if if it is contradictory
 	
 	
 		a a legitimate a legitimate appeal not a technicality of uh if
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they're not arguing that the guy
 		or woman committed the crime they're arguing over well were his civil rights violated because uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time those are the things that have caused them to drag out i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		that's right well one of the sad things is that so many of these
 		never actually come to trial because of
 		of the process in which the criminals were apprehended
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean uh you know the guy is guilty you know he's done what he's done you you may have stood there and seen it but because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know he he goes free uh-huh uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		he didn't see his lawyer as quickly as he should have or or some some
 		Mickey Mouse type thing like that
 	
 	
 		right and i realize that that is designed to protect the innocent it's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers and uh i
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		i just don't think that i think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had some statute of limitations on lawyers  i hope you're not a lawyer
 	
 	
 		yes
 		no i'm not a lawyer i it's i i i'm an accountant and i agree we practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers  to a degree
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		absolutely that's why you check books out from the library but i really believe that
 	
 	
 		there you go
 	
 	
 		our justice system is is the best around but it's not perfect and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact
 	
 	
 		well it's it's a case that we have a a legal system which the criminals have found a way to
 		use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		that's how we get caught in this uh sort of a catch twenty two
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but you have to continue uh
 		to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty
 	
 	
 		that's right and and it i don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that just that really does ruffle my feathers at times i mean i can just get so aggravated about it
 	
 	
 		yes  it does most people
 	
 	
 		but
 		you know it's it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem and and i hope not lawyers
 	
 	
 		but again one of our
 		one of our problems is that uh our legislature and the state and our national congress the majority of the members there of are lawyers
