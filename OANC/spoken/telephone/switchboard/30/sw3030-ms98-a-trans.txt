 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well hi i guess uh
 		i'll just start by saying that we entertain with uh a gourmet club here
 		um which means that we have like eight eight people four couples
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and most of the husbands this is really peculiar
 		most of the husbands cook
 	
 	
 		great
 	
 	
 		i mean the wives during the day you know get i guess so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day um you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff but it was the guys that got together and did all this and um like my husband just
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		he really really likes to cook in terms of um
 		oh
 		barbecue and i mean all guys i think like to barbecue i think it's caveman mentality but um he really does cook and it's a good thing because you know you can't you can't knock that but all these other guys do too
 	
 	
 		right right
 		no
 	
 	
 		and so we've gotten together and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals and it's really really kind of a neat thing to do you can
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how often do you meet
 	
 	
 		well we try i mean because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that it's like
 		you know if we can do it once every six months we are doing well yeah so i mean we originally started out you know when we were younger  and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um then we would
 		we tried to do it every other month but lately it's just been once every six months
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh well that's much more reasonable i was involved in a a club like that for um that you know where we tried to really do gourmet uh meals and uh we
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we were a little bit too frequent i think i don't remember if we were once a month or anyway it was
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it was difficult by the time we went around it was uh four couples so uh by the time we got around uh to each of us and it was time again we were almost tired you know
 	
 	
 		really really
 	
 	
 		um partly because um  gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining it's too rich
 	
 	
 		oh it is absolutely
 	
 	
 		and so i we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um so uh we we kind of and then one of the couples uh moved and so we sort of didn't didn't continue it but um and i must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time
 		then you you don't have as much time for uh regular entertaining but um
 		when when we entertain i usually try to find something that would be  um kind of good for everybody and that that sometimes means you can't do gourmet
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because depending on who your guests are
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well yeah that's true and we have a
 		gourmet friend that
 		can't stand fish so mean and she can get with in
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		uh so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese uh well i take that back uh she can't eat some cream cheese but that that really limits um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 		it sure did it makes you uh keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out for something like right so we we try to keep all that in mind but otherwise um i guess you know entertaining um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		i i guess i have recipes i
 		um but that's that's basically what we do is the gourmet so you know they would be pretty elaborate
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um but it's fun i mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff and you know you get all prepared but you're right it's very very rich and i'm glad we don't have it every
 	
 	
 		oh wow yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because it is it's a quite a treat it really is um
 	
 	
 		yeah sounds wonderful
 	
 	
 		right but so you like food and i just love the the community of food i just think it's neat i just love sharing meals and
 	
 	
 		oh sure i do too yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um and whatever you can do you know to do that i don't think you have to be you know more than hamburgers and hot dogs out in the backyard and the and the coleslaw and potato salad but but
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		sure well my um daughter is graduating uh Sunday and so we're having a uh few
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		people in Sunday afternoon and i did a cop out on to it i'm
 		buying cold cuts  well i have to make a cake and i have to make hors d'oeuvres and i have to make dessert so i figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but you providing
 		so right
 		right there you go
 	
 	
 		uh so oh i'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on but i can't do it you know working full-time and it's just too much
 	
 	
 		i know we're all not built like uh what what the
 		oh
 	
 	
 		those people that try to do everything
 	
 	
 		Martha Stewart you know we all aren't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and and time to you know shoot yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		wouldn't that be nice
 	
 	
 		shoot a video of the whole thing i don't know but it's it's really kind of a neat thing i get a kick out of it i i really do everything all parts of the food i mean i love to make things from scratch you know making breads and
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know people really pretty much appreciate it and
 	
 	
 		oh they do it it's very difficult to purchase um  items that are as good as what you can make yourself
 	
 	
 		oh i think so
 	
 	
 		um in spite of uh or if you if you do buy it it's extremely expensive in fact uh i just got back from a shopping trip to purchase purchase them
 		cold cuts and i i bought turkey and pastrami and and barbecued ham at a an Amish market near here and i've never been there before and i found that there's uh individual vendors and the foods are wonderful and one of the uh the um  vendors had
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		cakes all sorts of wonderful cakes uh they
 		fresh strawberry strawberry cheesecake now and and so on and it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um which is really not such a bad price i decided i i i just couldn't quite make myself um  buy it because i do make cheesecake and somehow
 	
 	
 		there you go
 	
 	
 		i didn't want to do that because it but i was very tempted because it looked wonderful and they they had black forest cherry cake and all those things that are but those are homemade they are not um
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		commercial bakery made and in that they are made in their homes um so it it's kind of interesting um it's out there if you want to pay the price but
 	
 	
 		oh it is i mean we have bakeries around here that you know you you just gain weight going by the door you know just like that really but i don't know i guess some of the best things i've ever had um
 	
 	
 		right just smelling the air yeah
 	
 	
 		i some of them were just hors d'oeuvres you know doing little hors d'oeuvre things that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i have a kick making that i mean you know  i get off on strange little details of food i guess but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		gee we have so much going on here because  you know this is
 		Dallas this is the southwest this is you know chips and Picante sauce and anything hot you know you can always make it hotter and and lots of stuff like that you know so that's um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		really good party time eating all that hot food and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they just love it you know down here it just just you know all the
 	
 	
 		we like hot food too so
 	
 	
 		stuff that goes with that so oh i'm not thank you for noticing  i'm from Chicago  and how i got really and well how i got to
 	
 	
 		right you don't sound like you're from Texas originally though
 		
 
 		i thought i thought that there was a slight difference in accent
 		right
 	
 	
 		Texas by way of Virginia i'm and everything is a long story but yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh that did um do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy or is it always complicated
 	
 	
 		well absolutely i in fact it just came to mind um and this
