 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so tell me about China Cry
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay China Cry was basically the the true story written by this this lady who had uh
 		was a native is native Chinese uh
 		uh who was raised by Christian parents and her her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty nine revolution
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i see
 	
 	
 		although she herself had never really
 		accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other uh Christian uh
 		portions of of the faith repentance baptisms et cetera et cetera she had always felt a very strong uh
 		leaning in this direction and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty nine occurred
 		and most churches were either banned or their all the clergy and so forth were ah killed or or imprisoned or and the property confiscated
 		she was safe because she had you know not officially joined the the Christian movement
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 		anyway she as she grew up towards maturity her parents well her dad was a doctor and and he was rather well you know rather well to do in the old regime
 		and the the China the communist the communist Chinese didn't like this at all
 		you know the bourgeoisie was was was definitely out of uh style then
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		everybody was back to a commonality of one
 		and so they kept picking at him picking at his at her mother
 		and uh finally
 		uh started picking on her
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and getting her to you know they were starting to uh
 		accuse her of of of uh
 		crimes and atrocities before the the revolution and and had her write her own story over and over and over
 		uh and the uh the major point of the movie was that that she had
 		uh married this this Chinese fellow
 		and was with child when they started this mass court now i think i'm leaving out a portion she graduated she went through college and graduated
 		very high up in her class and had uh gotten a job as as an instructor and they had her teaching or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when the they decided that that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre uh regime crimes as it were being a child you know so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they kept on and on at at her and in the meantime she and her husband uh were expecting expecting were expecting a child their own child
 		and uh the the people kept harassing her over you know over a period of months and finally
 		they uh carried her
 		uh out into the courtyard to to either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of of
 		shooting her uh with by firing or you know executing her by firing squad and uh the Lord just said no this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know she's she's one of mine she is not going to die and um
 		the the the soldiers were blinded when they shot
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and she her life was spared
 		and this this frightened the the uh
 		the commandant and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		and course here's this this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		well she she put in for
 		going in  going to uh and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong uh and then she put in to go see him
 		and over time she uh uh finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the the middle
 		uh bureaucracy bureaucracy that they finally let her go
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and of course she had to walk you know they they stripped her of everything practically besides the the clothes on her back and uh so she so she went across the border to her husband and another and other child that they'd already had
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh to freedom
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they knew that she wasn't going to come back but yeah she did years later when the uh liberalization you know in real life uh liberalization of China happened and uh she was not persecuted or anything else like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		huh interesting story
 	
 	
 		yes it was uh very moving too
 	
 	
 		i uh i don't even remember seeing that advertised and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly
 	
 	
 		well it was within oh
 		ninety days
 	
 	
 		oh that recent
 	
 	
 		yeah no i mean it's it was it was advertised over a period of about ninety days
 	
 	
 		oh i see what you mean
 	
 	
 		but it wasn't uh they didn't have it in uh
 		too awfully many movie houses but it was it was in the it had large uh uh
 		uh press release
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well uh i guess what i what i saw most recently and luckily i saw it only a week ago  so i'd remember remember it well was um sort of light by comparison uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my husband and i had this great desire to go see a comedy and
 		and uh we ended up going to see Green Card
 	
 	
 		Green Card
 	
 	
 		Green Card and and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he chose it and uh it's got this wonderful French actor who's
 		it was his like his and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years
 		but he's never made an American film this was his American film debut and he speaks very broken English
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and basically he played um a Frenchman who married an American girl
 		uh in a marriage of convenience
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh because she could claim she was married she could get uh an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive
 		building in New York that had a garden an an an outside garden which is very unusual there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because she was a horticulturist and that was sort of her dream of course you know they got married and they never saw each other again except except fate threw them together and the Immigration and national Naturalization Service
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um started investigating so they had to get back together and get their stories straight
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and she was a very sophisticated well sophisticated
 		urban New Yorker and he was a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he'd been working in a restaurant when they met
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		they had to learn all about each other basically in a in a weekend and uh it was you knew what was going to happen of course
 	
 	
 		just a minute
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that they would fall in love well they fell into like at any rate and
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when they went to the
 		query or inquisition or whatever
 		uh they did perfectly and then he said something because his English was so poor on for the most part he
 		he was so proud of himself for giving examples all the correct answers that
 		that on the last one he said oh i never remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers
 	
 	
 		uh oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um
