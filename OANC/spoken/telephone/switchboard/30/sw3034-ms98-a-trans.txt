 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		i hope you know more about the subject of baseball and where they're going than i do because
 	
 	
 		oh i know a little bit about it i'm not a die hard fan but i i enjoy the i like the Boston Red Sox myself
 	
 	
 		well i of all the sports that there are that there is
 		i like baseball the best however i haven't been to a baseball game in years but i have kept uh my eye on the Rangers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and i guess they were doing pretty good up to a point and then they kind of fell on their face
 	
 	
 		well with uh
 		their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately so
 	
 	
 		correct right they've got a one man show going there  which is interesting you know um
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh it's amazing
 	
 	
 		i guess he can i guess he can really call down a salary  they're so astronomical i can't even imagine  that kind of money you know it's just uh phenomenal
 	
 	
 		right
 		well fortunately the Red Sox last time i saw the paper earlier this week were in first place and doing quite well um i
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		been really busy at work this past week and normally on my way into work i'll pick up a newspaper and uh
 		it so every day i'll have a newspaper at work and when i take a break i'll look at the newspaper but this week i've been so busy i didn't even bother to stop
 	
 	
 		i understand i understand
 	
 	
 		but
 		hopefully hopefully next week i'll get back to my normal routine
 	
 	
 		okay uh you are involved with TI's uh speech um
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		recognition
 	
 	
 		well not really i um i
 	
 	
 		how did you find out about it
 	
 	
 		i work at  laboratory from uh i'm an officer in the Air Force and uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		i see interesting
 	
 	
 		they have a speech lab across the hall from us
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		and uh the speech laboratory does some work
 		with uh TI at uh not in my office but uh in my division they do
 	
 	
 		i see
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		quite a bit of speech work
 	
 	
 		well that's good well that's interesting and the topics are interesting uh they run a whole gamut of
 		of uh subjects and uh i think we can address every topic but the depth of knowledge is quite different
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		so uh when they chose baseball i mean i'm i'm i can understand baseball you know i don't understand football um you know uh it's such a rugged game that it uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh it seems to be too physical for my uh interest
 	
 	
 		oh i prefer to i i i like
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i never used to really like watching football that much but more and more these days i'm
 		i i'll like a football game but i've always liked baseball i i prefer to watch
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i guess i'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football and i i'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game
 	
 	
 		well i i can relate to baseball because i used to play baseball but i can't relate to football because i've never
 		played football and and don't and have have any interest and i said if i ever had a son he would not play football
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i had four daughters so that wasn't a question but now i have a grandson that is you know is gung ho for um
 		football
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh that doesn't please grandma too much
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i'm always afraid because the injuries are so uh can be very very devastating
 	
 	
 		well there's injuries in a lot of sport
 	
 	
 		i understand that but i think they they happen more in football i think the odds are cut down you know i i know they can get hurt in baseball too
 	
 	
 		i i
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the bat is a very heavy object can do a lot of damage but uh i think
 		that they have a a lower ratio of injuries ratio of injuries in baseball
 	
 	
 		oh
 		baseball that's true i i would say that baseball tends to be one of the less
 		troublesome sports but uh for some people it's just uh
 	
 	
 		because the yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		a love for them
 	
 	
 		well that that not so much that but uh even in baseball you can like when i played baseball when i was uh growing up i had trouble uh
 		uh just throwing the ball because my i was very
 		i was always very strong and i could throw when i was young i could throw
 		harder than my uh like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to and so i was always throwing my arm out and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i see
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		having trouble i and i was a catcher so i was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and and that kind of stuff so i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that was always a problem for me was just just the constant throwing
 		so
 	
 	
 		did you did you sustain any permanent uh injury with that
 	
 	
 		no i did that wrestling
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh oh okay
 	
 	
 		no i'd well i i uh i always been quite an athlete and doing different things and um
 		the other thing was i'd never really let injuries stop me but interestingly enough you mentioned football is like now i won't play football anymore because of the uh
 		because i separate a shoulder wrestling so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um but i stood the stood the injury wrestling but it
 		as long as i let it heal it never really bothered me then playing football this fall
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i it was just flag football too i separated it again and it seemed to be like the straw that broke the camels back so
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		um um-hum
 		well i have uh i have a broken arm that i had since i was three it was never set right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh uh i liked bowling as a as a kind of a relaxing sport
 		and uh one of the men that was in our league in on our league uh noticed uh you know uh my broken arm and the way my ball would do and he says let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage
 		and so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen i had my high game of two eighty seven
 	
 	
 		my God
 	
 	
 		so uh yeah  uh it was really funny you know that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and and how to uh keep uh
 		follow through with my uh addressing that to put the ball the uh pins
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that was interesting so i really um i got a lot of uh recognition from the uh
 		uh the bowling league i guess i'm not sure where all my pins came from but but it's but that was quite awhile ago but i and i never pursued it and a lot of people said well you should have turned pro and i thought nah not um hum-um i don't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my love wasn't there for the game i liked to as a as a method of uh entertainment and i uh fellowship but uh outside of that no i didn't and i and i still i like to bowl but uh
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i don't have um Jack standing behind me to tell me what to do
 	
 	
 		are you uh you on any leagues now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i'm not no no uh at TI they have a sponsor a junior league achievement and uh it's true bowling and i've never uh shared shared that with them i would have to brush up on my bowling before i ev en
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		tried to uh win a lot of money for the junior achievement uh organization but that's the only thing that i would you know be allowed to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		well my grandmother has been bowling for gosh maybe thirty forty years i don't know a long time and she still she's got to be
 	
 	
 		um-hum um um-hum
 		still carries a good league uh average
 	
 	
 		well no she doesn't
