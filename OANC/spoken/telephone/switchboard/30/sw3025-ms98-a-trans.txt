 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		yep
 	
 	
 		okay i i do a fair amount of cooking
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i love having guests to dinner
 		i probably do that at about once a month
 		and uh
 		i usually prepare something depending upon the guests you know if if i like to prepare chicken that seems to please please everybody pasta or a casserole how about you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah those are things i like the most i like fish and chicken the most
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and um  most i cooking i do just comes out of a can
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		unless unless it is unless it is i catch a fish and i prepare it
 		and then i just uh you know i just broil it and put lemon on it
 	
 	
 		um-hum well that's about the way i prepare most fish
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i made scallops the other night that was unusual and uh
 		basically uh i found a recipe to to make it in the microwave
 		and you sprinkled the you you swished around a little melted butter and do uh
 		oh i do not know microwave microwaved them for about
 		nine minutes no no four four and a half five minutes and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top very simple but very nice
 		so if you are looking for a fish recipe that was good
 	
 	
 		sesame seeds and bread crumbs
 	
 	
 		sesame seeds and bread crumbs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh my husband liked it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh no unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive
 		uh fish items
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you know i i look for them to go on sale at the grocery store
 		uh
 		one of the things i love to do eat out how about you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-hum
 	
 	
 		do you have any particular places you like going
 	
 	
 		oh there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i like that it's just it's just home cooking
 	
 	
 		yes i've been there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i kind of kind of like the black eyed pea but i don't think it's a chain
 	
 	
 		right exactly uh-huh and that's that's the other restaurant also think they got black eyed pea
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so
 		i don't really like uh  you know uh chili places or what is it Judge Roy Bean's or
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't like greasy places
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i i don't feel like they are very healthy and i always feel like the home cooking places are are the healthiest meals even though i tend to have chicken fried steak when i go go to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right and i and i got uh
 		chicken marinara the last two times you know
 	
 	
 		oh how was it
 	
 	
 		it was i was great because that's that's what i like i don't like it you know it's like a baked
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know a piece of chicken and then i get like
 		green beans and mashed potatoes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know
 		
 
 	
 	

 		yeah i i tend to uh i get teased by my family a lot because uh i like experimenting on
 		on food and sometimes i go for exotic fairly exotic
 		things and and my father teases me about gourmet cooking
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which is not always true but  and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else is that some of the experiments fail
 	
 	
 		no that's true
 	
 	
 		uh the last time we had some uh friends over for dinner i tried the dessert that sounded wonderful wonderful in the recipe and it was just total bust
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i was sorry i didn't have ice cream to fall back on
 	
 	
 		yeah my uh my brother tried to make a bunch of things uh way back he tried to make bagels one time
 	
 	
 		oh my that's ambitious
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh  we took some and and we had uh German shepherds at the time and we took some and gave it to the dogs
 		and the dog never you know he treated it like a milk bone and he never did finish it he barely made a dent in it
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and uh then he tried to make grapefruit citron one time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's uh supposed to be a candy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it it didn't turn out very well it was you know
 		it it like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into uh
 		into a kind of a candy stick so
 	
 	
 		huh
 		see i am not that's interesting one of the things i don't make is dessert
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert deprivation because you know we have ice cream  or something like that and that's why when i took did this
 		experiment for this company we had about three weeks ago it was just a total fiasco
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		everything else was fine but that was a fiasco
 	
 	
 		well you have to put eggs and everything don't you or
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah just about
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i also don't have much of a sweet tooth so i can live without live without desserts for the most part
 	
 	
 		uh-huh use about half the sugar or
 		make everything diet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh do you cook for yourself or do you cook for others
 	
 	
 		mostly i just cook for myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well when i was single i used to uh i think my favorite meal was a
 		a baked potato
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it's easy that's for sure
 	
 	
 		and
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and i mean i never put anything other than a little butter on it if i had or or if i had a little cheddar cheese sometimes i would grate that up
 	
 	
 		hum yeah i always put cheese on them
 	
 	
 		and uh amazingly satisfying
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		but you know there's hardly any i guess there's hardly any protein it's mostly starch
 		fills you up and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get
 	
 	
 		yeah i didn't i didn't say it was nourishing but it was satisfying
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it really is
 		then you have to make a salad or
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah
 		yeah that but you know um i i never really enjoyed cooking for myself so i ate very simply and i was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's why i think that's one reason i like having people over because i could try things i mean i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that cause cooking is a little bit like like being in a chemistry lab
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		except you get to taste the product instead of
 	
 	
 		instead of having an explosion
 	
 	
 		
 
 		foam up or blow up or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		sometimes it blows up anyway
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  you know
 	
 	
 		i i once had a an old boy friend over to to dinner when i was just briefly staying with my parents
 		and uh
 		i had this wonderful recipe and and you were supposed to make a a toffee like substance
 		for a pie by uh boiling evaporated milk
 		three hours and it does turn to toffee inside the can
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the only problem was when i opened the can
 		it just flew all over the place it was on the ceiling on the walls and me and and the boyfriend
 		saw that he was supposed to be there at six o'clock not seven o'clock so just at the time all this happened the door bell rang and there he was
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i had to have my my my my dad sort of entertain him for a for  for awhile while my mother and i scrambled to clean everything up
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		did you let the can cool off
 	
 	
 		uh i really don't remember that was about ten years ago i just remember
 		how embarrassing it was and i have made i have made it since i've i i and several times before and i never had that problem just that one time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh he he was a gourmet cook he was kind of person who
 		acted like he came from San Francisco and he had a very sophisticated taste i i really wanted to impress the heck out of him and and  well it was a memorable evening anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but i i do enjoy cooking so i was awfully glad i was given this
