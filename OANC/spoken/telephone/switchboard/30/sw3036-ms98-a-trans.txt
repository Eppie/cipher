 
     		
 	
 		well uh if you had to pick a a type of music that you like would you be able to
 	
 	
 		well i could pick country music
 	
 	
 		country music
 		i
 	
 	
 		as i've gotten older i've started listening more to the words of music and to the softer melodies
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh are you from Texas
 	
 	
 		not originally
 	
 	
 		not originally where you from
 	
 	
 		Georgia
 	
 	
 		Georgia okay well see i'm i'm from Chicago so
 		uh i'm kind of in a different category here uh
 	
 	
 		if you had to pick one what would you choose
 	
 	
 		uh i would probably go with it's tough uh
 		i think i would just stick with the classics only because uh
 		i like music just for music's sake and
 		uh you know i'm from the era where you know we had all the rock and roll i'm forty so i'm you know part of that whole deal and uh
 		that was a real interesting time and you know the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound uh
 		but i think i'd stick back with my Beethoven and my Bach and my Mozart
 		i mean because it's just it will always be there it's classic and i don't have to worry about you know what's current and what's not because i haven't been current with music for a long time but you know same
 		um and as far as country music is i've never really uh listened to it i mean because that's just it was it wasn't part of what i knew so
 		there you go
 	
 	
 		well i understand what you're saying i think if you would listen to it a little you would discover that it has a lot of roots
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		from the both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that that we both lived through
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		i it's it's a different perspective on everything too i i know well whenever they talk about uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		country music it's about it seems sad to me it's always about some guy losing some girl and then
 		you know playing the guitar and singing about it
 	
 	
 		well there's some joy in it also
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but mostly it it just tells a story about life
 	
 	
 		yeah well i must say though uh i listen to Amy Grant do you consider her country
 	
 	
 		i don't know i'm not all that familiar with her work
 	
 	
 		uh uh let's see well name some people that are country that i should listen to
 		that would be good
 	
 	
 		well i kind of like uh
 		i like
 		groups
 		like the Statler Brothers
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and
 		the Judds certainly
 	
 	
 		oh okay i i must admit that's yeah they're fantastic so
 		uh
 	
 	
 		Reba McIntire is a little
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		too country for me
 	
 	
 		she's something though she's got so much energy
 	
 	
 		the
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 		let's see well i guess i i have
 		listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that i do like some of that uh Dolly Parton she's kind of is she kind of country
 	
 	
 		oh yes that's certainly where her roots are
 	
 	
 		kind of
 		right down there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh how about the Oak Ridge Boys
 	
 	
 		very much so
 	
 	
 		very much okay well i like them too so i guess i've had a smattering and i just uh
 		you know picked i've picked up a little bit along the way that i probably wouldn't have if i'd stayed up north you know
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		you know so well i think there's music all around anyway i mean i think life is just music so you know you can hear it wherever you want and uh
 		and i've i've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because i just don't understand it but maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which i really like so
 	
 	
 		well it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a a record of the rap songs of the eighties
 	
 	
 		yeah the greatest hits right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so i mean it it it'll if it stands the test of time we'll see
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh then it'll if it survives then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of hey listen what we listened to can you believe this sort of thing but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you know i i think of i get real tickled when i listen to some of the old Beatle uh music you know the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still and
 		and uh you know all these rocks rock stations call it classic soft rock you know  but we used to listen to it full blast
 	
 	
 		right
 		of course
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff but i don't know well you got any more
 	
 	
 		well the big key is that i think you've already stated that all music is rooted in the classics and it has grown from there
 	
 	
 		well
 		that's
 	
 	
 		well listen i have to run i hate to cut this short
 	
 	
 		okeydoke well it was great yeah and we'll uh  listen to some more music and uh i'll look at some country
 	
 	
 		all right
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
