 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so uh what do you do with your lawn
 	
 	
 		oh i just i just mow the lawn that's about all i ever do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you put any fertilizer or anything like that
 	
 	
 		um
 		not really to speak of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		when i was little we used to use uh like uh chicken manure and
 		cover the whole lawn with it
 		and then uh plant uh Bermuda  mostly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and how about uh like landscaping or the you know bushes or flowers or anything
 	
 	
 		um we had monkey grass
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a wax leaf ligustrums
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and do you like take care of those in anyway as far as uh feeding them or
 	
 	
 		well the freeze it's really it's bad here because the last couple of years the freeze has been real bad
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i had to hack them off a little bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		and it left most of them dead in in a lot of places it they just killed them right off
 	
 	
 		oh did it
 		right right
 		well we have we just moved in and we're uh kind of our yard has been left untended mostly for about six years so there's a lot of clover growing in it and everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so we're trying to do is kill to to kill back all the weeds and the clover and let so the grass can grow
 		and a number of the bushes uh there's a lot of boxwood bushes and all that were overgrown so we had to trim those all back you know to to nice and round because they were kind of sticking out all over the sidewalk and everything
 		and there was some uh some juniper that was uh absolutely huge covering up half the driveway just about so we had to cut it all back so you can park the two cars in it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh mostly what we're doing since we got a yard service to our lawn service to help fertilize uh seed aerate the lawns uh so that uh you know we can get it back up to speed and to and and to get
 		get it all green again and i was gonna watch what i was gonna to do is watch them
 		throughout the year and see what kind of fertilizer they use and uh then i'd just repeat it from then on myself
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh we're also kind of looking at uh a little bit of landscaping as far as putting some uh azaleas in with uh you know different white azaleas and red azaleas and purple azaleas you know to give a little color into the
 		into the landscape there
 		and uh you know put a couple of plants around our deck in the back and a couple in the front with the existing plants uh to give a little color and everything
 		uh do you do anything like that or
 	
 	
 		um  not very much um just um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we had some hanging uh flowers in the on the porch and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a few plants on the inside
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that was about it
 	
 	
 		you know some of the things that i've seen around here too is that a lot of people uh there's kind of two ways to to that i've seen to cheaply fertilize your yard
 		and one was to uh i guess a big thing around is a called a composter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know where you have you heard of that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah whether you you know you put your whatever different grass clippings and all that in and and you let it sit there for a while and it kind of cooks or something as as it decomposes
 		and we sort of have one by guess by accident that's in our backyard and so we're thinking about using some of that to spread around you know the the the bush beds and flower beds and stuff
 		but another thing that uh one of my neighbors is doing and it it his yard looks really good is that he's not using any of the he's not collecting any of the um
 		uh the the uh grass that he mows up at all he just let's it sit right back into the grass you know doesn't collect it in a bag or anything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and by doing that i guess it sort of acts like it's own fertilizer
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh it just makes the grass real thick and and green and everything and it doesn't cost anything
 	
 	
 		yeah they have a they have a mulching blade now it cuts the cuts the grass up real fine and you don't have to you don't  you can't even see it when it falls into the grass it it just penetrates right through to the ground
 	
 	
 		oh you mean so that's a separate blade
 	
 	
 		well i don't know exactly what it does but it cuts the grass a lot finer than than uh the old mowers used to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh do you think that that's like uh a blade that you can put on any mower or is it a special lawn mower the whole thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh it's a special blade i mean they have mulching mowers but then they have a mulching uh mulching attachment too
 	
 	
 		oh really huh
 	
 	
 		that you can put on other mowers
 	
 	
 		oh i'll have to look for that i didn't know it was a separate blade
 	
 	
 		i think i think it's double-edged
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it cuts it back and forth
 	
 	
 		oh okay oh i'll have to look for that because that that would sure help us yeah i thought it was i thought it was just i don't know something special on the engine too as well or something
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		huh have to look for that well is there anything else you'd like to say
 	
 	
 		uh no that's about it
 	
 	
 		okay well it was very nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay take care bye-bye
 	
 	
 		good-bye
