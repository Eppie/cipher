 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		first how much television watching do you do
 	
 	
 		so
 		i do a little bit more than i think usual people do because i am here alone during the day and i like it just for the noise
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right but do you actually watch it and pay attention to it or is it more of a company
 	
 	
 		um
 		um it just depends on what it is i mean i have my favorite things that i do and that's a fun thing to do sometimes but um what about you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum okay
 		right
 		well actually i i work full time and when i'm not working i'm running and i don't watch a lot of television and i'm very selective in what i watch if there's something that i absolutely
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		want to watch i will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off i probably watch television four hours a week
 	
 	
 		well see that's great yeah
 	
 	
 		max and uh if if i don't find something that i really want or really want to watch well then i just do not turn it on i would rather listen to music
 	
 	
 		well
 		right
 	
 	
 		part of it is that uh i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis and i think that if we're doing other things and these programs come in
 		sometimes they influence us and we don't know where that influence came from
 	
 	
 		well i think that well part i think that's partially true i think you have to have the will and the and the um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway i think it you you could be susceptible to stuff and it has to be reinforced at another level too but anyway what would you watch if you had you know this week to watch i mean do you like specials
 	
 	
 		uh right right right of course i uh
 		that's right
 		i uh
 		well last night for example i really would've liked to have watched Unsolved Mysteries those are fascinating to me if i have the opportunity i watch it unfortunately i was with someone else who was flipping channels i hate that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor
 	
 	
 		oh right yeah
 	
 	
 		in our comedy programs although nobody can appreciate comedy any more than i can but i would prefer to find a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians
 	
 	
 		well we have cable also and and sometimes you can um get the uh HBO specials and sometimes those are really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right and some of those are fine programs uh-huh
 	
 	
 		pretty hysterical so i i like to watch comedy i mean you know that's something but i'm not real up to date on what's going on now i i guess i have my old favorites that i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i i enjoy comedy um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		hooked into i mean you know like Bob Newhart still on on one channel and uh you know something on that level i i also enjoy um i don't know its Sunday morning
 	
 	
 		um-hum i enjoy that um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's channel thirteen i watch a lot of thirteen uh The McLaughlin Group and i i just laugh i mean i think it's so hysterical these guys it's just so much fun it's just
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		that's right
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's just a lot of fun watching that i mean i don't agree with a whole lot of stuff they say  but it's fun you know so yeah i watch to be entertained i really do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right right
 		well
 		yeah i watch it for entertainment but i also watch it for uh cultural impact i do a lot of channel thirteen channel three some of the educational channels and i watch for special programs that have special
 		a special play a special concert uh i recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars
 	
 	
 		oh now that was fabulous and that you know yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and it was fabulous i just absolutely you just held you breath in some of those uh Patavani and uh  oh i was just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know so
 	
 	
 		makes chills all over you
 		so i i may or may not even look at the TV guide but if i have time i may flip through and say hey
 		this looks good if i finish this task i can watch that in an hour uh if the hour comes and i don't get a chance to watch it so what
 	
 	
 		you know well there's certain things i mean i've got um my TV in the kitchen here and um you know if there's something like cooking shows i love to watch cooking shows
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		i do too it makes me want to cook and then i eat and then i get fat so i just let other people watch when i eat what they cook
 	
 	
 		i i really do
 		i know  i i yeah and and there's some um in fact one of the watercolor shows on now has inspired me to take watercolor lessons you know so
 	
 	
 		oh i think that's marvelous yeah oh yeah i took a lot of my college courses i took some of my college courses on television so that it's very successful for some of those things but i think i really got stung very badly
 	
 	
 		you know things like that you you get a whole whole lot of exposure
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		about having influence in your life or at least i've i saw a very bad example of having television influence your life uh
 		my husband had an aunt who was addicted to the soaps and i want you to know that became the most suspicious cantankerous contrary old woman that ever was i mean she
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		she thought she was
 	
 	
 		absolutely i don't know who she thought she was but she just got to the point where you could might near you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice and that attitude being demonstrated
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and for her to miss a soap was was a big withdrawal and
 	
 	
 		oh well see that's you you you but she was probably depressed to begin with you know what i mean  yeah grumpy to begin with
 	
 	
 		well i don't know well she was grumpy to begin with there's no doubt about that but uh
 		but you could clearly see those influences and in my youngsters i know that one day uh my youngsters were watching the Three Stooges and i always thought that was just casual slap stick comedy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i hate that show
 	
 	
 		but when one tried to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench i decided that wasn't funny anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah i i good
 	
 	
 		and i really i really feel very strong about the Bart Simpson Show i think that is the kids watch that and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid that i ever saw and i just i do not like it uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		isn't that amazing how old are your kids
 	
 	
 		huh mine are grown but i have grandchildren and young children around and uh for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic
 	
 	
 		oh okay so that's yeah
 		i had forgotten about that see it's just my husband and i and so i don't have that you know i uh that constant influence of the kids shows and all that but um i don't know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum yeah yeah
 		well i was very careful even when my kids were kids were at home and when they were young i really did uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		watch what they watched i was cautious i sat down with them and i watched it and if i did not like it i changed the channel for them you know i i you know i distracted them changed their interest
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because i just couldn't tolerate that kind of influence on my kiddos it just would
 	
 	
 		and and you know they get it at school too anyway so you might as well not reinforce it you know i
 	
 	
 		sure that's right that's right gosh they got they're mouthy enough anyway
 	
 	
 		i know i remember going to school my parents were a lot like that too and of course we did not have any of the variety you know kids have but all the kids used to watch Rawhide and all those shows
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and my parents never let me watch anything like that i could watch Yogi Bear you know what kind of culture was that  and i remember going to school the next day and everybody would be asking oh did you see that did you see how he did that and did you see and i could never participate
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it always made me feel a little bit you know like a loner like i you know but um
 	
 	
 		sure i can understand how that would happen
 	
 	
 		but see then my parents i think then you have to replace it with other things you know to uh
 	
 	
 		absolutely well i did i ran my kids to death  i said hey i think that's enough television for awhile maybe we need to go outside
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really yeah
 	
 	
 		and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company so i'd go out with them now see there's the problem parents don't do that they say you go outside and play
 	
 	
 		that's true or you go rent a video up at the store and come home and sit down and watch it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i said but but we went on field trips and we did other things and i think that was
 	
 	
 		well that's you know that's something people don't do that well here we are talking on that subject but that's that's an interesting concept i've got to stick in my  um you know work with kids on but um
 	
 	
 		of course
