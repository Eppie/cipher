 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		all right what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over
 	
 	
 		well i have a really great one that i make in the summertime because it's cool and it's uh it's just really pretty easy it's pretty much dumping things in and stirring and i like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in in it and then i you're supposed to do chicken but i just use those little cans of chicken
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it makes it so much easier and so you dump the rice you dump the chicken and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off but i get my kids to do that so  i i don't have to do that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um and it really and you mix it all up with yeah there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up but it's so simple and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you serve it cold oh yeah that sounds good
 	
 	
 		yeah it has to sit in the fridge over night but but it's really good
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and i like that one
 	
 	
 		yeah usually when we entertain we do something really simple because i like to visit with my company and not be scurrying around in the kitchen so a lot of times we'll barbecue like that for Memorial Day we had some friends over and we
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's Meat Marinate and put it on the smoker and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		cooked it and that it was real good you can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way and then people think they're eating steak or something
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah
 		and these days that helps doesn't it yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it really does
 	
 	
 		i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		i don't usually i just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because i just know i'll never take the time to do it
 	
 	
 		now spaghetti's such an easy one um i do that a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i do spaghetti a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems like most people like spaghetti
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't like to do that if if it's hot real hot though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because um
 		i don't know i have a real thing about being hot in the in the summertime i guess
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in your whole house
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's right and um
 		we don't entertain that often but when we do i'm like you i like it to be fast and easy and something so that we can talk and not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time
 	
 	
 		most we don't entertain like people from work or stuff even often usually friends from church and stuff and it's usually kind of like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you want to come over and they say well what can we bring and so it's real easy because you just make one or two things and everybody else brings something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's exactly like us from our church we just do it yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah it's a lot more relaxing i don't know if i could take the pressure of having to make you know put on this really fancy dinner for someone
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well you see all that on TV  and i could never be that person
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		it just uh i'm just not well i'm so i'm pretty laid back
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and so i don't i know a lady in a my church and uh she
 		like does her own bread and does her own stuff and so when she um does food she really goes all out and i don't know how she can do it and be calm
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah do you work
 	
 	
 		i guess no i don't
 	
 	
 		do you stay home with kids
 	
 	
 		uh-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've been working we're going to have a baby this summer and i'm not going to work anymore yeah so hopefully i think i'll enjoy cooking more when i don't have to work all day i don't like to come home and
 	
 	
 		oh how exciting
 	
 	
 		stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night so
 	
 	
 		yeah well i usually start about six and an and cook and and then eat at seven i mean cook cook at five and eat at six rather
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		eat at six yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh my family and i we're a sit down together family
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i don't like the run in and out part and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me and and my husband about what's happened and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's neat
 	
 	
 		i think i that was ingrained in me during my family time at home and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know we could learn to talk about things and i think that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah that really is it keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other
 	
 	
 		yeah i think
 	
 	
 		right now we eat in front of the TV but since it's just the two of us it's
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well that happens to us sometimes too uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sometimes if something uh is on that they want to watch i leave it on but we eat in the kitchen and their heads are always poking past the door
 	
 	
 		uh-huh see what's happening
 	
 	
 		yeah anyway food is is uh a real lifestyle kind of thing and i some people don't like to do this but i like to cook uh cook with my kids
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and if they're going to have other kids over then then they help and we make real simple things you know those oh i don't i don't know if you've ever made them maybe not since you don't have kids yet but those JELL-O
 		uh gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers i can't think of what they call it
 	
 	
 		oh i've seen those in the magazines
 	
 	
 		yeah they're so simple
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the kids love to do that uh finger food is is a biggie with them and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and like  now one thing i wish i could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that and it's just really hard and if they have to work with a knife i don't like that so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's uh they like to eat it but it's a hard one to have to to prepare
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll bet
 	
 	
 		but they like that with the the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that so yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah we like that
 		that's good that that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too
 	
 	
 		yeah my son's getting to be a a real good cook so uh
 	
 	
 		oh neat
 	
 	
 		sometimes he fixes me breakfast
 	
 	
 		oh wow that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah i like it i like it a lot
 	
 	
 		how old he
 	
 	
 		he's eleven
 	
 	
 		eleven wow that's good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah so he's
 	
 	
 		do you cook breakfast like you cook a breakfast every morning or
 	
 	
 		uh not every morning uh
 		mostly during the summer it's hit and miss and we usually have like uh cold cereal or something like that um during the summer during
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wintertime when they're in school um then i try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a twice a week or something and then have like when it's really cold
 		i even cook oatmeal because i like oatmeal and the look they like it all right and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		then sometimes we do something it has to be fast because they're on their way to school we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that but
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i try to uh and sometimes we do eggs if i get up
 		early enough to do that i used to do them in the microwave but they don't like that
 	
 	
 		oh do they get rubbery or
 	
 	
 		uh um
 	
 	
 		i've never tried it
 	
 	
 		it depends it depends if you let them cook too long
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then they'll turn a little bit gray you can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray and they will be a little harder and i don't like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in if you have a microwave book but uh you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a
 		like a plate over the top and let it steam and then and then stir it up
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		yeah an and that turns out okay and it's funny because if i turn them out on to a dish i on to like a plate for them to take what they want
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they don't know i've ever done it in a microwave
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's really funny it's very deceiving you know because if they see it with their eyes they go uh i don't like want that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and yet if they don't ever see it then then it's like oh this tastes okay you know so anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we had my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash everybody would say we don't like squash we won't eat squash so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there you know and then we'd go oh this is really good
 	
 	
 		yeah
