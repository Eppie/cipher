 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		good morning my name is Jean
 	
 	
 		hi
 		i'm Tina
 	
 	
 		oh where you from Tina
 	
 	
 		i live in Garland Texas
 	
 	
 		oh Garland Texas i'm in Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		oh my lands  you're the farthest person i've ever talked to yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really
 		do you work for Texas Instruments
 	
 	
 		my husband does yeah probably most people you talk to do huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh huh
 		most of them do now i don't have anybody that works for TI but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		my son works for a computer company the National Institute of some something i don't know what
 	
 	
 		i see well that's neat
 	
 	
 		so i guess we're supposed to talk about foods today
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess you have to push one though okay yeah
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh you ready okay
 		
 
 		uh foods like you would plan for a a dinner party or something like that yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so it may be interesting because probably here in Texas we may eat a little differently than you do up there
 	
 	
 		well i don't know my brother lives down East of us down there and i don't think they ate all that much different
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		uh i think as long as you plan your basic foods course for a dinner party  you fancy things up a little bit more
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well uh the thing that i found interesting my husband and i lived up in Washington state for awhile
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		and up there of course they ate a lot of sea food and that kind of thing and down here sea food is pretty expensive because you have to ship it a long way to get it
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		right
 		yeah and it's not as good as if it's fresh it
 	
 	
 		right and and uh and but here we eat a lot of like Mexican foods and um up there there was no no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is that right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could but it just didn't taste right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they probably were trying to do the best they could yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh down here we eat a lot more fried foods i think like chicken fried steak is a real big thing and up there uh it was hardly ever heard of and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we drink ice tea with every meal and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		up there hardly anyone drank ice tea
 	
 	
 		yeah well they do in the summertime i think that tea big in the summertime mostly of course you have warmer weather most of the time
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah
 		right yeah it never gets real cold so
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		yeah so i
 	
 	
 		yeah but when when we have a dinner party around here i think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know that um i do a lot of planning with our church and a lot of the times when we get together well everybody will bring a Mexican dish or and Italian food is real big too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh more like covered dishes for those type of dinners
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah yeah how about you what is real popular up there
 	
 	
 		well i don't know just about anything
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah we we really uh use most anything i uh
 		i think are like parties and that though are well like we had a dinner party here here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party  but basically we tried you know included all the basic uh foods that you are supposed to have in a meal here
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		your uh
 		bread family and your or least what it used to be the regular menu followed and ham and bake potatoes and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		uh something from each each area that you're supposed to choose from
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh we we we ourselves are into the wok cooking you know they been advertising that and we've really been enjoying those uh meals
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		they have a lot of vegetable to them and uh they really are very good
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 		oh yes i i love that kind of cooking my uh unfortunately i am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things
 	
 	
 		is he a meat and potato person  well all our family is is gone they are out on their own and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		they
 		uh-huh
 		that probably makes it easier but
 	
 	
 		it it's much different and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah we find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese and uh  and of course
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh well my husband didn't like that so we as kids we had five children and we ate that when he he wasn't going to be home for supper that's what we had
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right yeah well that's pretty much what we do if dad's not coming home we have macaroni and cheese or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they like uh spaghetti you know that's one meal i can fix and the whole family eats but there are several things that well as a matter of fact i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time because
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		yeah yeah
 		oh those always go good
 	
 	
 		yeah the children love them and uh they are real easy to cook and that way whatever meat we have if they don't like it well and my girls don't like beef i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh really well maybe that's good the way way the things are going
 	
 	
 		i guess
 		well yeah it could be because they don't i think it's the texture of it but it takes more chewing  and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers and that and it is easier to chew
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		right so they're not too much into beef and my husband and i eat more beef than we should but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		we don't really have uh you know entertain too much
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know if you do or not but we we don't a whole lot we're more once in a while but mostly family activities
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well most of the entertaining we do is church associated we have a real tiny little house we don't have room really to have people here but we do get together for what fellowships at our church and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my husband and i do a lot of the planning in that and
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah it is and it's fun to uh i like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah we do a lot of that type thing at church and our homemakers meet at the church also and uh that's what we do mostly most of the time for that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you don't really include any certain food groups you just bring what you like
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		sometimes you have all desserts sometimes you have all vegetables
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's truth that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever you uh like best
 	
 	
 		yeah but it doesn't happen very often usually you get a pretty wide variety and you can you can have a pretty good meals from one of those
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah i remember one time we had a progressive dinner it's the only time that ever yeah they are
 	
 	
 		oh those are fun
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the it's the only time that i can remember that i can't remember what food it was i it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		several people were supposed to bring you know each like uh a an appetizer and a main dish and a dessert and we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers and
 	
 	
 		uh uh-huh uh
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but when we came to the main main dish plate there was only like two or three
 	
 	
 		oh
 		is there enough to go around
 	
 	
 		well not really you know we all took real tiny little portions and uh were kind of angry with whoever it was we weren't sure who didn't show up with the food
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		they were suppose to keep uh
 		yeah that's kind of irresponsible but that what upset you because they are grown adults usually and they know they know better even if they can't do it they can always need to get somebody else that could
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right
 		right either either go ahead and fix your dish or call someone that can i know it
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		well that sounds neat i can't uh believe you're so far away but you sound so close
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they said that we could share we share a recipe but i'm up at my daughter's i don't even have any of my recipes with me uh you know
 	
 	
 		it sounds like you're here in Dallas
 		oh
 		i don't know if i have anything handy we were just about we were getting ready to go swimming and we're waiting on my sister
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		Cara hold on just a second
 		as a matter of fact my little one is hollering
 	
 	
 		they're ready to go well i we probably have we talked long enough i'm i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i think it probably has been so i've enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay so i'll let you oh same here you have a good day
 	
 	
 		thank you thanks for calling bye-bye
 	
 	
 		uh-huh bye-bye
