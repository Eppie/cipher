 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what are your favorite things to watch
 	
 	
 		oh um
 		let's see
 		i uh
 		i have enjoyed uh Thirtysomething
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in the past uh now now that it has gone off
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		some comedy shows uh
 		i can't can't think of off hand of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what what are your what is
 	
 	
 		we do not watch a lot of TV we try to watch it on Thursday nights we usually watch LA Law i like that real well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and Cheers we like to watch that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		ah we like to watch that uh we sort of got hooked on LA Law um do you ever watch that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh yeah yeah we we we try to catch that most most nights
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i have watched Thirtysomething some in the last couple seasons i was sort of sorry to see it go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		too
 	
 	
 		it it was kind of interesting uh some people complained about uh
 		uh
 		the
 		kind of whining or whatever on it i i did i really did not think it was it was that way i think it had some some good uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		good situations that it uh presented
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought a lot of the like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff  i can relate to some of those things and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just the dynamics of it and everything
 	
 	
 		well i think i think a lot of people you know kind of felt that way but they had a lot of uh
 		uh uh counseling groups that used some of the episodes as as examples of of things that were going on and uh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		you you you know that the effect of interaction between people and sort of to use as uh as a way of getting people to talk about their problems that sort of thing uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we  kind of uh
 		uh our TV viewing has uh slowed down a little bit since our
 		our daughter came along so uh that that tends to
 		put a cramp in your viewing because by the time you get through
 		getting her ready for bed and everything uh
 		it's uh very little TV time left
 	
 	
 		yeah you are too tired  do anything yeah it's better to spend time with your kids i think though than glued in front of the TV anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		probably more worthwhile i just don't i don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be really
 	
 	
 		no i i i can't uh i don't think there were uh i i haven't
 		i haven't uh uh there are not as many good shows that i that i continuously like to watch as much as i used to
 		i uh
 		you know there uh i used to could be able to name ten shows or so you know that i felt were worth my time to watch but uh i i
 		i very seldom like to watch there there's there's a there's a couple now that i tend to want to watch i like uh home improvement shows like Bob Vela's uh
 		Home Home Again on Saturday morning it's enough it's like it's like This Old House but it's uh it's on instead of being on public PBS it's on regular TV but uh it's kind of interesting because i
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they renovate an old house and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i've seen parts of that before it is interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so uh i i like to watch that
 		uh some some things on PBS i like to watch but uh
 	
 	
 		do you watch sports much on TV
 	
 	
 		yeah if it's somebody if it's a team or something that i am really interested in i i am not one to just watch
 		a football game just to be just to be watching it or i am not a big basketball or baseball fan if it unless it's baseball if it's some if it's a team i really like i may watch but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		its uh baseball to me is a little hard to watch on TV for an extended period yeah its so slow that you just get bored i'll i'll switch between
 	
 	
 		yeah it's slow
 	
 	
 		something else and and and a baseball game going back and forth you know watching it but i usually if if if it's a football team i really like a college team or or
 		pro team that i'm fond of i usually will will sit and watch that but uh that's the
 	
 	
 		yeah we are like that and occasionally we'll like on if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something we'll watch a little bit of a golf tournament but uh you can not take a whole lot of that either it's pretty slow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's kind of like football like baseball
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh do you watch we rent movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home because there's just nothing on Friday and Saturday nights there's nothing good on
 	
 	
 		right i think that that that's
 		um what more people are doing and i think that's
 		you know as as TV i think that less good shows being on TV has caused a lot of people to do
 		to do that uh
 		you know to get more movies and watch i know we've we've done that too in the past uh we don't do it quite as much now because huh our baby won't let us watch them but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you know we usually will we used to rent uh two or three movies on a weekend and and and try to watch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you have cable TV
 	
 	
 		no uh we live in
 	
 	
 		we don't either
 		i thought we were the only ones  who didn't have it
 	
 	
 		no no we uh the uh development we moved into
 		was they have it on on side like right across the street from us but when they built our section they didn't didn't put it in and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we've been there about two years now and they're still still do not have it so i'm hoping that
 	
 	
 		gosh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that soon they'll they'll they'll i have contacted them about this and they say that well it's it's
 		they look  they every year they look at different areas and try to determine where where uh the most houses will be and so they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they look and they when they when we reach a certain number of people in that area they'll put one in put some in or they'll at least consider it so
 	
 	
 		huh yeah
 		yeah well we had it for awhile and it just seemed like we never watched any it we didn't have the movie channels we just had all the
 		normal ones that come and we just never watched any of them we kept a log for a month of every time we watched it and it seemed like we didn't watch even half an hour so we decided to just cancel it it does improve the reception a little bit though that's the only thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 		yeah
 		yeah i've uh i've i've uh i have i put some put in some uh an antenna a really good antenna and uh it's really helped you know ours and it's not been too bad i have not really missed it
 		that much there are certain things that i've that i want to see you know occasionally like like a football football game a college game or something that happens to be on cable or some old movie
 		you know i i haven't been bothered by it by it too much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well i can't  uh think of too much else to say  since we are not big watchers  well it was nice talking to you um bye
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		okay
 		all right bye
