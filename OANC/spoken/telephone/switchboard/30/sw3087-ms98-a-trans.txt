 		oh really i don't know a lot of the um
 		uh musicians' names or the singers' names but i know a lot of the old songs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh we just got a disk the other day that was a um disk of Nat Nat King Cole's greatest hits and it is excellent it it's about twenty of his greatest hits on it it's really an excellent

 		really
 		at at the same time or
 	
 	
 		no i played the accordion until i got into about sixth or seventh grade and then in fourth grade i started the clarinet and i played that all through high school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh Like so you're in the marching band and stuff in high school yeah i i played the baritone horn in high school band and in college so and my wife played flute in high school
 	
 	
 		i was yes
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and then in concert band i played the bass clarinet
 	
 	
 		really really actually that's exactly the same thing my ex-wife did  she played the clarinet and then she played bass clarinet during concert band
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yes yeah so
 	
 	
 		i like the low notes better than the high notes so
 		we didn't have any bass clarinet players so i asked him if i could play it because i was first clarinet and they end up playing a lot of the high notes and i don't
 		i don't care for the sound of the high notes so i asked him if i could play the bass clarinet and he said sure you know he didn't have anyone to play it so i played it and i really enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		um well i like it i i like the low instruments better too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um do you go to do you go to listen to much live music
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		do you listen to much live music like concerts or things there
 	
 	
 		no i really don't go to very many concerts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we're we're going to one here in a couple of weeks the um
 		um i don't know if you follow Broadway much but uh Michael Crawford was in Phantom of the Opera on Broadway you know you know whom i'm talking about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and he's coming to Dallas on the twenty ninth and we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of uh Andrew Lloyd Webber's music so that'll be good
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		my sons are kind of into Broadway they they my my older son is at Columbia in New York City and he's been to see Phantom and Les Miserables and bunch of other things up there so
 	
 	
 		i would love to be able to go see Les Miserables
 	
 	
 		and he does it he can go if they get sixteen dollar tickets to that thing yeah yeah and one of the uh the last time they went up a friend of his wanted to go and Chris didn't want to go so the friend David went and
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets and they they gave him the seat that normally belongs to John Bell John it's his house seat that's under his control and he said it was a great seat
 	
 	
 		holy smoke
 	
 	
 		so he he's been to they've been to see it several times
 	
 	
 		oh i would love to go see that and Cats
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Chorus Line
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i would love to be able to go see those
 	
 	
 		would they do don't any of those ever come to Pittsburgh
 	
 	
 		they do but i work and i went to i go to college i had just gotten i just graduated from college in May and so i really didn't have the chance or the money to go see them
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well we're kind of you know they well i saw two two road shows of Les Miserables and they were both excellent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so if it comes to Pittsburgh in the road shows and i think they have three different companies that tour the US um you should go see it because it's really it's really outstanding
 	
 	
 		yeah my brother doesn't even like that kind of stuff and he went to New York a bunch of there was like twenty students from high school that went and he went to New York with them and he saw it and he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and he doesn't even like that type of stuff
 	
 	
 		well i think it's just incredible i and then you know those um two guys who wrote Les Miserables wrote a new show call Miss Saigon
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah it just opened in New York this spring and my son and his friend were in a lottery to get tickets to it and they got tickets for the opening night
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they went to it and they said it was it was great it was great
 	
 	
 		oh see now i like that type of stuff but my fiancee doesn't really like it he's more into the New Wave music
 	
 	
 		yeah like depressed mode and
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess i don't know either you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't too much but my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know uh really weird names like The Dead Milkman or sure i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh it's you know really weird stuff he likes and i thought oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		so he listens to New Wave and you listen to the oldies that's kind
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's kind of different well that's good though you know it's good to cover all the bases there
 	
 	
 		well
 		i pretty i'll listen to anything basically except i don't like the real hard metal rock
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i just refuse to listen to that at all i'll even listen to country i don't i like some country
 	
 	
 		well we don't now we don't listen to much country but we just at the same night we bought that Nat King Cole album we bought Garth Brooks' album No Fences
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that is excellent
 	
 	
 		do you like Randy Travis
 	
 	
 		we well we i've never never listened i mean i've i've probably heard him but i've never bought any of his music
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Garth Brooks is probably the only country album we have or no wait my wife bought an album of Hank Williams' greatest hits
 	
 	
 		oh Hank Williams Junior
 	
 	
 		nope this is Hank Williams senior so these are a bunch of old recordings
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she bought that the same night we bought the Nat King Cole and the Garth Brooks
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well those should be good albums
 	
 	
 		it is pretty good she likes it it's a little it's a little too country for me it's a
 	
 	
 		if you have the chance
 	
 	
 		little too uh
 		honky-tonk or something
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i like i like the Garth Brooks album a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's pretty good it's pretty good
 	
 	
 		um i don't know maybe you wouldn't like Randy Travis he's really country himself but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i you know i i really enjoy listening to his music
 	
 	
 		which album which of his albums do you think is the best
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know If i were you i would get the Greatest Hits album
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		if he had one because you know that would have a mixture of all his you know top songs on it
 		but um we have i think four records of his i can't you know name the names of them off hand but we have i think all his records so far and all my brothers and sisters listen to them even the ones that like the heavy metal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they really enjoy listening to him so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know maybe if you did like Hank Williams and Garth you know maybe you would enjoy Travis uh Randy Travis
 	
 	
 		well i i think we'll probably get one one of his albums because we do kind of like it but you know it's kind of different
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so so it's good
 	
 	
 		um do you know any oh i was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would you know
 		i mean the women do you like the Judds
 	
 	
 		yeah we do like the Juds in fact we have a Juds album
