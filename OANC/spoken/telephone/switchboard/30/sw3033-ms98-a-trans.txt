 		right
 		well right now the main thing that i've been doing craft wise anyway is uh i make earrings out of paper and buttons and i do sweatshirts and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really
 	
 	
 		yes how about you
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds fascinating um well i'm i'm pretty traditional i've i've been doing um a little bit of quilting and uh made my first quilt ever i mean it's wonderful it's beautiful
 		i don't know if there'll be a second one but the first one is you know hand pieced and hand sewn and it took months upon months to do this anyway um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there's that and then uh now i i've developed an interest in watercolor so i'm taking some classes over at Michael's
 		and i'm trying to uh make it look good
 	
 	
 		that sounds really interesting my husband does uh painting he's been doing in acrylics and he wanted to do some things in watercolor i hear that's one of the hardest mediums to work in however
 	
 	
 		i don't know that i just someone gave me some paints for Christmas one year and i said okay i'll try this
 	
 	
 		are you pretty artistic
 	
 	
 		i guess i am i'm i've i've been sort of painting stuff and people say why don't you let me hang that in my room you know
 		so i've got stuff hanging in people's houses that i look at now and i go oh i can do so much better than that so i guess i've you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		developed somewhere along the line but um you know it's it's an interesting thing and i really do like it it's real peaceful it's real quiet you know
 	
 	
 		well to me the quilting sounds like the thing that would be
 		the hardest to stick with because it is so time consuming
 	
 	
 		it is it's amazing the results are incredible
 	
 	
 		have you thought about selling them
 	
 	
 		um no because i can't get beyond making this first quilt i'm afraid  if i make another one i'm keeping it  the watercolor i can dash off in twenty minutes and that's you know it's finished but um yeah the quilting forget it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um i would even join a quilting group maybe to help somebody else finish their quilt sort of thing
 	
 	
 		well you know what i've kind of been looking for i sew not as much as i used to but uh i have scraps of fabric
 		and i thought it'd be nice if i could find you know maybe uh in senior citizens home or something to give the pieces to maybe these people could use a little bits of uh you know leftover fabric
 	
 	
 		you're right yeah they love that that would be good really and uh
 	
 	
 		all you have to do is figure out how to get hold of some of these people
 	
 	
 		yeah i yeah i'm finding out that um there there are an awful lot of quilters out there and and it's not just traditional quilting either people you know are using it for making clothes
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they have of they make they call them crazy quilts
 	
 	
 		like the vests or something
 	
 	
 		the vests and things like that and they make whole outfits out of you know scraps of this and that and it's getting to be a real art form
 		what you wear on your back  you know  maybe you'd like to try it  um but i think it's great that we have the availability here to you know um like Michael's
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and be able to be trained and and do some things like that so that's a lot of fun i
 	
 	
 		well i was looking into uh i wanted to take a flower arranging class class and i called i think i called Michael's and Zak's both and as it turned out the month that i called they didn't have anything and then i didn't call back
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i think it'd be nice to learn how to arrange silk flowers and uh save yourself some money on some of the flower arrangements
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		oh absolutely and i just i love flowers i you know i got to have flowers around me you know kind of thing um but the button thing now that sounds really interesting you make earrings
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		some of them i'll just uh well years ago when i was sewing quite a bit i found a place that you could buy bags of buttons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know assorted buttons and oh sometimes you got ten of a kind sometimes you got one of a kind but anyway i decided when i started making paper earrings maybe i'd branch out a little bit
 		and i got out my button collection and there were a lot of things in there that i could make particularly the metal ones you know i could just put backs on them
 	
 	
 		oh right
 	
 	
 		um i'd have to clip off the uh shanks and all but then some of them after i ran out of that i just started painting them with my uh sweatshirt paints
 		and you know making things to match my outfits
 	
 	
 		oh how clever
 	
 	
 		so i've been having a good time with that
 	
 	
 		right my my sister-in-law up uh in Illinois she was well
 		in a real rural area and she's starting to collect antique buttons and she makes big huge pins out of them
 		and these big wooden buttons are just  um you know they're all sort of layered and put together and glued and back and everything but they are just incredible they're so pretty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well a friend of mine said uh had a pin that was made out of antique buttons and the thing was just gorgeous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and it's they're all wooden buttons it's really neat and she says everybody up there wears buttons on their socks
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah they just you know um do some artistic thing with the buttons and i don't know if they hot glue them on or whatever but
 	
 	
 		i guess that hasn't hit in Dallas yet i haven't seen any of that
 	
 	
 		yeah i know well this is this is mid state Illinois i don't know how long it will take if it ever gets here you know but that's what they're doing with buttons down or up there but it's really neat i i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and you do the painting on the T-shirts too the sweatshirts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that's what we did for Christmas as a matter of fact for all our friends and family we gave them the hand painted sweatshirts and thank goodness my husband helped me with it because i think i had about fourteen to do
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh there you are
 	
 	
 		and uh i thought i'll i'll either be working on this constantly or i'm never going to have these finished by Christmas but they really did turn out pretty i was really pleased with them
 	
 	
 		what kind of medium do you use on them or do you like glitter and painting scenes and
 	
 	
 		uh i usually use a transfer we've done some southwest things and uh i've done some flowers but i haven't gotten so far as to do oh you know some of the little pin on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh bows and everything it's strictly been painting so far but i'll use um i did use some glitter paint on a Christmas one and some in some of the metallic paints
 	
 	
 		oh well still
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you know each time i do one i try something a little bit different
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh well see that's that's really neat that's a great outlet
 	
 	
 		the only problem is i've done so many i don't know when i want to touch another sweatshirt again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well Christmas is only six months away now  really i  the year goes so fast it's  an incredible thing well i'm sure we enjoyed talking to you today
 	
 	
 		oh i know i better get started right
 		
 
 		well thanks for calling
 	
 	
 		and uh i think this is great and keep on with those sweatshirts
 	
 	
 		well it's fun you get other people's ideas on things too
 	
 	
 		really that's true well you too bye-bye now
 	
 	
 		have a good weekend bye-bye
