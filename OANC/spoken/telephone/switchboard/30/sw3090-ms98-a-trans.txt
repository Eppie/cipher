 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um well do you uh keep a family budget or or do you have some
 	
 	
 		no i don't use a family budget my father who's very old has kept one his entire life and i probably rebelled rebelled against it and probably should have kept one he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh interesting
 	
 	
 		on a very strict percentage
 	
 	
 		yes well um we sort of started doing it years and years ago and my husband started graduate school when we were first married and i sort of just got in the habit i guess and you know and never have gotten out of it
 		i can't really say that it's a formal budget it's more just a a pretty um a fairly uh accurate accurate um recording of what i spend and what i think i'm going to have to spend and
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		i think it makes much more sense and i've recently uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		gotten out of debt and everything and i'll probably keeping start keeping a little better track of it i just uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		spent whatever came in and and uh didn't never knew what came in what went out but uh just you know like about like the government runs
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah  sounds real similar
 	
 	
 		huh
 		so i think it's probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record but my dad's was so precise that i mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent and
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh my yeah
 	
 	
 		that was put over there and i mean uh of course he's from the depression and uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so uh you know it's his life but uh i i would i think it'd be smart if somebody would keep uh
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		some sort of a plan that works for them
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you're right um well it it what's been sort of interesting to us is to um it because since i have uh pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years i guess
 		i can go back and look and it's real fun to just see what how things have changed over the years uh for instance
 	
 	
 		yeah it is  i'm a historian and my father had kept them i think since nineteen twenty seven and
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		but he burned the ones from twenty seven to fifty i couldn't believe he did that but then so i took the ones from fifty two on to the present but
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		yes
 	
 	
 		to look to have looked back into the twenties and thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that but uh
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		well as a matter of fact uh my mother was going through some things uh not long long ago i guess it's been a couple of years ago  in an old trunk that she had
 		and she came upon a budget a budget book that she'd had back in the thirties uh when they it was the late well i guess it would have been i take that back it must have been the forties because they had been married uh probably fifteen years at the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it was just fascinating uh fascinating to see how little things cost i mean it was it was just almost laughable in some instances that you know of course it's all relative of course but
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i know right right
 	
 	
 		uh never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know for a price pair of shoes was uh like five dollars and
 	
 	
 		i know well even in nineteen sixty three i found a a record that i had  had traveled in Europe a lot and i what i'd paid for hotels
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now and i paid uh oh between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty and that's really crazy because that's about thirty years ago
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh isn't that something
 		really oh that is that is really really something
 	
 	
 		oh but but of course it's just what the market'll bear and if people if people will pay two hundred then why charge ten you know yeah
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		yeah that's good that's right that's exactly that's just good old economics working
 	
 	
 		right right that
 	
 	
 		well uh we've tried to uh instill some sense some sense of uh of budgeting in our kids but our two children are just uh as um unlike as night night and day and our son could care less about a budget and our daughter watches her pennies so closely that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		she almost she almost just sounds like your father i mean she has everything planned so closely closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah well then you never know how they'll one they they may switch flip flop when they get to be uh older well older the other one may be very careful and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		she may marry somebody and of course it'd be good because if you marry somebody a little loose then she'll have that stability of watching uh you should have one in the in the in the house and i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think that's true i and and it's
 		i kind of think that's sort of what happened in our house because i think my husband was not quite as uh good at saving and so on before we got married and i was i was really diligent about that i always putting money aside and when before i was married you know when i was working in and out of college and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh that really paid off because when it time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in in in fairly good good shape financially as far as not having many major debts and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's about the way it is here if it hadn't been for my wife i would have probably been in debtor's prison if we had one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 		but uh what does you husband do now
 	
 	
 		well
 		uh he is an engineer he's uh an electrical engineer and in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his PhD so we had a a lot of lot of years of budgeting
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um
 		oh yeah you have to do it when you're in school my wife's still in school getting her doctorate and so i it it and i've got
 	
 	
 		and you know yeah when you
 		uh yes
 		well i'm working i'm working on my masters degree now so in fact this last year we had three two both of the children were in college our son has a year left our daughter graduated this year and i'm uh just about ready to finish my masters degree so
 	
 	
 		um um
 	
 	
 		we've had uh once again you know some really a real lean year for us
 	
 	
 		oh i i know we had three in college plus my wife so that was four so we're both in the same
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yep yeah you know exactly what it's what it's like then and it's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		which you learn i guess you figure that that's an investment that is um really a invaluable invaluable um-hum yeah and
 	
 	
 		that's the best one yeah with education you can't take that away from you
 	
 	
 		that's right so it's it's one that you can live through and i think that that's way we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school is that there was a light at the end of that tunnel you know that
 	
 	
 		right
 		sure
 	
 	
 		that it was worth it to save and then not have uh something and uh in return know that something  better was going to be at the end of it so uh it really makes it easier but uh well i've enjoyed talking with you Jay
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true yeah
 		i have enjoyed talking wit h you Kathy
 	
 	
 		and i i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me i'm interested in that
 	
 	
 		well if i had your address i'd send you i am also in the travel business i do tours and i can take some real great tours to Europe so uh if you
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh wow well my my husband and i just were there last year um actually we didn't take a tour we we were in England and and uh went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and and did it on our own but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i uh that sounds interesting do is your business in Dallas then
 	
 	
 		yeah it's in Dallas it's here in the Quorum so i'm i'm Jerry Hammond and i'm out at Brookhaven College so you could just holler at me out there yeah
