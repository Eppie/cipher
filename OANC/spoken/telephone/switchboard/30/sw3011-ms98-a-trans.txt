 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right so uh you live in Dallas
 	
 	
 		yes i live in Dallas
 	
 	
 		now i understand that um the the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down
 	
 	
 		yeah i think right now it's it's kind of bad uh i don't live in a house i live in an apartment
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		are are you in a house okay
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh yeah we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington
 	
 	
 		well i guess the best i can do is is uh compare apartments  if i can compare the one that i have now with the one that i had the last time the one that i have now uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		has a lot more amenities i guess is the right word than the one that i moved out of uh this one
 		you know gave us free cable and uh ceiling fans and uh
 		it was practically new when i moved in here and the carpet was new and
 	
 	
 		huh do you live in the high-rise
 	
 	
 		no it's not a high-rise it's just a a two story building
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but there's you know there there are a lot of buildings but it's just two stories
 		uh on the second floor they have they don't have a patio but they have a sunroom instead of the patio on the first floor um where i am there's a patio
 	
 	
 		oh okay so so you just you have one floor all to yourself oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah the rooms are nice and large and
 		let's see i have i have two bedrooms
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice do you get your own washer dryer
 	
 	
 		well i i i have a washer and dryer area and i i did buy the washer and dryer but they didn't provide it the one that i moved from didn't didn't have a place to put put them and that's one of the reasons that i did move
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah that is nice
 	
 	
 		yeah get tired of dragging clothes to the Laundromat
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so tell me about
 	
 	
 		yeah i've always uh been pretty lucky the real estate out here's been pretty good its uh the the prices of well the prices came down last year we've we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome  the past uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia it just never happened before so it's really surprising everybody  all the developers don't know what to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh just
 		it's real good
 		yeah it's a good time to buy if you're in the market
 	
 	
 		yeah unfortunately we're uh we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids and we have a three bedroom house and it's pretty much filled up right now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh so you want a bigger one
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum get an extra bedroom or a basement right now it's just a a single level rambler
 	
 	
 		uh-huh one thing about the houses in uh in Dallas they don't uh utilize basements the way they did in New York
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my parents in New York had uh
 		a uh three family house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		actual actually it was a two family house where the the um
 		the downstairs and the second floor they had and then they rented the third floor with the whole
 		apartment
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		they had a basement and they
 		you know they finished the basement and they were able to rent that out also
 		but uh in Dallas i i just i i just haven't seen basements in houses
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i've looked at a lot of them
 	
 	
 		yeah a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there and that's what he said was that you know it just wasn't something that people had down there they put pools and garages on but uh no basements
 	
 	
 		no it's not
 		right
 		i haven't i haven't i have yet to see a basement in a house
 	
 	
 		hum maybe it's all the sand is there a lot of sand in i always think it's like a desert i don't know   when i think of Dallas always
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well no  no no no you know i don't see that kind of sand here
 		um
 		there are some areas though where where they have a problem with uh the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to the uh or the foundation sinking or something you know just a just a little bit some more than others
 		but you you have to know the right spot to to pick where that doesn't happen and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well out here we um we live in what used to be uh like a prairie or whatever a natural you know
 		natural grasslands and uh they it's just you go down four inches and you get to sandstone well fourteen inches you get to sandstone
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast  it's just solid sandstone
 	
 	
 		i see
 		huh where did you say you're at Colorado
 	
 	
 		no Virginia yeah it's sort of unusual really most of Virginia is clay
 	
 	
 		Virginia Virginia that's right uh-huh anywhere near uh Virginia Beach huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh  yeah my uh my folks used to live there back before i was born they lived there
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		well different areas in Dallas have different kind in uh in Texas i'll say because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in the in the Dallas you know Fort Worth city areas you don't see that
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh Texas is a big state so i imagine the the type of houses and uh things like that are truly different from area to area  but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		that's the same way out here because um well we for example and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and anything inside that beltway the highway the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you know you really can't afford i i i could never afford a house inside the beltway that's why we came out here this is called the the the country you know with only you know maybe twenty miles total from DC twenty five
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		from the city but um it's considered the country since it's uh you know that far out
 		but um yeah we live out by Dulles Airport
 	
 	
 		well
 		i see
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh  that's one of the few places still in northern Virginia they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here and you know it's it's still pretty rural
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore land has gotten so expensive they just can't afford to have low income housing like that
 	
 	
 		so is your house in an area by itself i mean
 	
 	
 		no we're in a development there's uh yeah there's another one half an acre away or a quarter acre away rather
 	
 	
 		not connected to another one
 		oh
 		but it's not they're not connected are they uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh no huh-uh yeah its uh a stand alone single family home i sort of got spoiled with that when i was growing up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh my folks um had an apartment for a while when we were kids but um
 		for the most part i they they always had you know and Pennsylvania always had a single family home and so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know as soon as we could we we got a single family home and that's all i ever knew growing up so i stayed in a townhouse for uh two years and then uh saved up enough money to to get a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
