 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay have you participated in anything like that
 	
 	
 		well a little bit we mostly do our newspapers we keep our newspapers and stuff like that and we take them to be recycled
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh we we have a pretty nice recycling center uh in our city now and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass
 		up there they're open like two days a week and you can just take it up there and drop it off it's kind of fun and everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		help the earth i guess
 	
 	
 		and a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah my husband was complaining the other day because he says every time i turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling like yesterday i was telling him you have to you're supposed to squish the plastic jugs before you take them up there
 	
 	
 		you're supposed to what
 	
 	
 		every time he turns around i'm giving him some new rule that we're you're supposed to squish up the you know like collapse the plastic jugs instead of taking them up there solid
 	
 	
 		but what are you supposed to do with them
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and i wish that our recycling center took paper bags they won't take those
 		we like to put our just put our newspapers in a paper bag you know and then carry them up there that way and we have to bring the paper bags back every time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they won't take them do you um take your papers somewhere or does someone pick them up
 	
 	
 		we we usually collect a you know collect a quite a bit and then we take them take them in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		we um we don't take our cans up to that center though our aluminum cans we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them
 	
 	
 		yeah we don't we don't um use aluminum cans so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we generally don't have those to do
 	
 	
 		yeah it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth
 		yeah worth bothering to go in and do
 		do you um have any ideas on anything that would make
 	
 	
 		you know they they charge you you know it's like a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		i know a lot of people it would would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup and some communities are trying to do that now and i think that maybe if they only charged
 		for
 		the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they they charged you by by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a landfill
 	
 	
 		yeah that'd be a good idea
 	
 	
 		that that might be a better way to do it and then people would would know that it was gonna cost them money to not sort their trash
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah that would be a real good motivation for people
 	
 	
 		you know because then it would then it would make monetary sense to them you know to say hey you know if i just spend the time to to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don't have to pay for them hauling it off
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags
 		like you buy your garbage bag from the city and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything so however many bags of garbage you throw away that's how many you have to pay for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah that's about the same kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that would be a real good idea
 		i'm trying to think if there's anything else i could think of they're talking about going to curbside pickup in our in our city  Rowlett Texas do you know do you where that is
 	
 	
 		where do you live
 		oh okay yes
 	
 	
 		and i don't know if they decided to do or not but i think they said it was gonna add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill
 		to have them do that although i think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even
 		break even point without charging people yeah
 	
 	
 		it seems like they would be able to
 	
 	
 		i don't know um
 		i guess it just depends on how they manage it i don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff the center that their got now where you take your stuff in i think i think that should be making some money
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they sell i guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i wish that uh
 		uh more of the cans you know like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable i don't a lot of that's that recyclable steel and i don't know anybody that takes that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true this
 	
 	
 		the my husband likes Pepsi and those cans are steel instead of aluminum so we can't can't ever recycle those i think it's a good reason to quit buying it
 	
 	
 		hm nah i didn't know that because we just usually if we're gonna um buy sodas they're in the the two liter bottles
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what we buy the most of unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to put the cans in a cooler
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		well that's all i can really think about  for recycling it was good talking to you um bye
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay all right bye-bye
