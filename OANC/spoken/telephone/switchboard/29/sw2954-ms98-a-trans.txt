 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		have you ever uh organized a family reunion
 	
 	
 		uh no i never organized one but we're we have one uh we're going to have one on Memorial Day i guess they've had one the last two years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we go out to the my dad's farm and uh
 		and you know it is just a picnic and
 		spend the night
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		go fishing and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		how many people usually show up
 	
 	
 		oh about ten
 	
 	
 		oh it is not that big
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		because
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		um
 		we've had sort of
 		weekends like that too but i never thought of it really as a reunion
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i sort of think of a reunion with my uh
 		all the extended family
 	
 	
 		everybody yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be hard for us because most of the family is out in California and some is in New York and North Carolina and it gets
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kind of hard to get everybody get everybody organized
 		uh is there someone do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there or
 	
 	
 		uh yes yeah my my uh dad has a house out there anyway and there is there is uh he keep us
 		uh food down there
 		year-round so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so he doesn't live there though
 	
 	
 		uh no it's it's it's like a country country home
 	
 	
 		vacation home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah it sounds nice
 		um are there kids that are there too or mostly adults
 	
 	
 		yeah the grandchildren
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just a few it just depends uh
 		uh uh all my grandparents are dead so uh there is there are not you know  none of them are there and and uh then an uncle is dead so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be
 	
 	
 		um-hum are you all located in Texas
 	
 	
 		uh yeah we're in we are all uh
 		like they live up in Sherman it is near Lake Texoma
 	
 	
 		um-hum but
 	
 	
 		and uh all of his children live in the Dallas area too so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do it that to me is you know
 		Dallas i know of Houston i know of and that is about it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in Texas the rest of it is sort of a big void to me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		you know we have uh
 		well we all got together it was about two years ago for i was i'd graduated from college and um
 		i was going to live in France for a year and so my parents invited it wasn't just family it was friends too
 		but um we all got together for just a party
 		and that was kind of fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		nice to have everybody be together at once and things like that
 	
 	
 		French reunion
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		not quite French but uh
 		it was sort of a reunion before leaving it was fun it was on um
 		New Year's Day so it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that was kind of fun
 		but um
 		who was it a friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago and you know everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend and it really sounded like it was fun
 		but
 		i am not quite sure what i would do i think it'd be fun to like rent a big
 		mansion or house someplace
 		and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and have different areas to explore and things like that so that'd be kind of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		meet in the middle
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where nobody lives
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but at least that way it is at nobody's house so nobody one no one person is responsible for everything
 	
 	
 		yeah and they don't have to clean up afterwards yeah
 	
 	
 		yep
 		that's for sure the cleaning up can be a mess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		does your does your dad have horses there
 	
 	
 		uh no he doesn't really have any any uh uh domestic livestock anyway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the he leased uh to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on
 	
 	
 		i see so it's so he really does use it as a vacation home it is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty much he has a garden and uh a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that sounds nice do people actually pick the fruit and things
 	
 	
 		um-hum and then there is wild blackberries there too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 		he gets
 	
 	
 		yeah i used
 		we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property but we never got enough i used to make jam but i never had enough to really make you know more than a jar or something
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so it wasn't so worth it
 	
 	
 		yeah it is kind of they're kind of off and on it seems like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		depends on the rain
 	
 	
 		that sounds is does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there
 	
 	
 		um it is uh it is uh eighty acres
 	
 	
 		well that is pretty big
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i do not know how they do scale down there you know here it would be a huge amount of land
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah because the person's house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres as opposed to
 		tens of acres
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 		and uh and most of it you know you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh because that's where the ponds are and
 		where everybody fishes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we kind of have a an infor mal contest
 		my uncle uh put some bass in uh his pond a few years ago well he put some crappie too but the bass we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they're in there but
 		they're real spooky
 	
 	
 		yeah i think my dad put some we have a little pond at ours at his vacation ho me too
 		and yeah i mean really little and they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in and there were too many little goldfish and so the big ones never got bigger
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh somebody suggested to get a bass
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again
 	
 	
 		never saw the bass
 	
 	
 		no so we do not know if it is living or
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh it is probably in there just burping goldfish
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we still have lots of little goldfish they propagate pretty well those little fish
 	
 	
 		yeah they really do
 	
 	
 		this
 		yeah because we started we have got hundreds in there now and we started with i think ten or twenty little feeder fish that i picked up for a dollar you know many no matter how many it was for a dollar
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		and some of them are probably
 		eight inches long but he wants your really big ones you know the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		they have there's a uh
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		you might put some like some yellow catfish in there i do not know if they'd live very well up in New York but
 		they get huge
 		and uh they routinely use them for bait for uh goldfish for bait for yellow catfish
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		well we we'd want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys the goldfish too  but yeah we could see i do not know if yellow catfish live up this way but catfish do i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah they live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so that you mean well we could try it that is a good idea
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he's he was trying to catch them you know using little uh
 		i forget there's little uh nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that minnow nets or something my father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish and it was really funny because uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh
 	
 	
 		one time he left the net in the pond and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh he left it in the middle of the pond and that night he came out and the trap was gone and it was a raccoon that had taken it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		so it was really funny and you could see that you know you could see where the trap the trap was dragged and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what happens
 	
 	
 		but do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there
 	
 	
 		yeah  and uh
 		we feed the catfish they feed the catfish like uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		every couple of weeks
 		and uh and sometimes that's the best time to catch them
 	
 	
 		when they're feeding
 	
 	
 		yeah because they'll just they will just come after anything then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you could catch a couple anyway during that time
 	
 	
 		what do you feed them
 	
 	
 		uh mixed Purina uh it is uh cat food uh catfish food
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah but
 	
 	
 		i mean it's especially made for catfish
 	
 	
 		yeah well i do not know how much different it is from dog food but you know it's um it looks like Purina High Pro
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's funny
 	
 	
 		but they come up to the top and it is the best time to take pictures because they come up to the top and you can see their whiskers come through the water and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're the catfish the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i have never seen catfish you know except in
 		filleted  filleted on a plate i think maybe i think i have seen once or twice in like the museum
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i've never seen them just alive someplace that would be fun to see
 	
 	
 		well they are really funny fish when you catch them they make a kind of a a burping growling sound at you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they try to hit you with their tails
 	
 	
 		how big do they get
 	
 	
 		oh well the channel catfish get up to uh i think the world record is fifty something pounds
 	
 	
 		okay but how long in feet
 	
 	
 		um that that is only about three and a half feet long
 	
 	
 		do you know
 		that's pretty big though
 	
 	
 		yeah they get real fat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		from the time they they stay slender until they get to be uh eighteen inches long and then they start to widen out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh my daughter we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing and i think that was when she was three and she caught a catfish by accident she was fishing for sunfish and she said here and she handed me her rod and reel
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and uh you know
 		it it was just pulling drag out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it swimmed wherever it wanted to
 	
 	
 		yeah that sounds amazing i'll have to see them sometime
 		but all righty
 	
 	
 		okay it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		nice talking to you too uh enjoy your uh weekend
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
 		yeah have a nice Memorial weekend
