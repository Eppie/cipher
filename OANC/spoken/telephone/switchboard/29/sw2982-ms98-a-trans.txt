 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay now you can tell me what you do
 	
 	
 		uh well i work with computers just like your son
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i actually do research in speech recognition
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		and so as part of the reason i'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i was working well actually i haven't worked for any large companies per se
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh recently but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well the one John works for seems to have a lot you know
 		good benefits and the pay is decent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah the uh
 		well actually where
 		i was working with the company
 		one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important because health care is so ridiculously expensive because we're we're paying our own insurance right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		for it um and i'm we actually had a little baby so i'm taking a little bit of a  time off from work ah congratulations
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		great i had i had a granddaughter
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and um so one thing that i'm very concerned with now is
 		first of all health benefits because it's more important with a family and you know our doctor's visits routine doctor's visits covered my health insurance only covers um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		your emergency care and so
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you have major medical benefits
 	
 	
 		right yeah but i don't
 	
 	
 		that that helps some if it depends on what your deductible is how high it is
 	
 	
 		right well my our deductible is five hundred but it's for each
 	
 	
 		each person yeah that's pretty hard that's pretty high
 	
 	
 		event yeah
 		right but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick it doesn't cover
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right that's that's right that's
 	
 	
 		doctor's visits things like that
 	
 	
 		and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it certainly is
 	
 	
 		yeah i know where my daughter works now she she course we live in a a rural sort of setting and where she works she has no benefits at all and her her wage is not
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 		wow
 	
 	
 		not very good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it's a it's a type of area we live in of course living expenses aren't as bad either though which makes a difference
 	
 	
 		and probably the medical care care is less expensive too
 	
 	
 		well she has to pay for it herself you know they have to pay for their own insurance but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so i think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there and so the insurance would cost lower
 	
 	
 		uh well
 		from what i've seen from my aunt and uncle really from Florida up to here they're not that much different
 	
 	
 		well i know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and they were at one of the better hospitals and you know good doctors in Boston
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's a big difference
 	
 	
 		and i was at one of the big hospitals in New York but that's a huge difference just between
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable
 	
 	
 		oh yeah should be
 	
 	
 		so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that i'm really concerned about and most companies don't have some are starting to have is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know someone that could watch my daughter at work and i'd go to work and if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever it is
 	
 	
 		and it'd be much more convenient yeah it would be more convenient too um-hum oh yeah yeah my my other daughter works and has they have to take their two children to day care you know
 	
 	
 		and i
 		it would be more convenient more productive
 		i think
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it it's it's i don't know how they do it i really don't you know getting them there and then and going to work and then picking them up and  all the preparations
 	
 	
 		and your and your and your hours are much more constrained and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that to me well that you know those three things the health care vacation and day care are probably the most important benefits i should suppose i should be concerned with
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		life insurance and uh retirement plans but
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i don't know i think those benefits you mentioned mentioned sometimes they're even more important than you the wage itself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if you can get those benefits even uh they they come out to much a much better benefit than than an increase in your wage a lot of times
 	
 	
 		right because you're you know certainly something like day care at the work place would like make life so much simpler that it's worth paying you know having a lower salary i would certainly accept a lower salary for that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum um-hum
 		oh yeah oh yeah it make it a lot better
 	
 	
 		you know everything else being equal because your life would be so much easier and there's a question of quality of life also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh well and if it was there you would really have a little more uh knowledge on what's going on probably you know with your child
 	
 	
 		yep
 		right and you you you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		and you're less preoccupied with it i think
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		so but unfortunately there aren't i think IBM has started having that in certain locations
 	
 	
 		i don't know my daughter one daughter works for MCI and they don't they where she works they don't have anything like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh is that locally
 	
 	
 		uh Pittsburgh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		yeah because Pittsburgh's a big enough city too but you know i wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones
 	
 	
 		um-hum  um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		things like that because many times small companies offer
 		better benefits
 		in terms of quality of life than larger companies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like uh one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby um any where between ten and forty hours a week
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um you know call call my own days call my own hours and
 	
 	
 		oh so they were very flexible and that that would be great yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and and
 		you know which many times at a large company it's almost impossible
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		to do things like that
 	
 	
 		they say you're going to do it this way and that's the way it's going to be yeah
 	
 	
 		right and if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and so it all depends on what your position is there too
 	
 	
 		true well that's true in any any company i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i've i've never well i can't say i've never i've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the home you know out of the home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh the rest of the time i've been an Avon lady and a  lady
 	
 	
 		was that when you were um well those have its pluses and minuses too i've been a consultant recently and so i don't have any benefits at all and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself yeah
 	
 	
 		right and the same thing my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is and um they they they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		usually consultants make very good income
 	
 	
 		right and they they refuse to give him more salary
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		because they say they can't pay more than this and that and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that and you know times are rough now so it's new it's harder to get
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		your increases and things but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		a consultant consultant consultant really is should be more knowledgeable than everybody else  you know so it stands to reason they should really have have more benefits
 	
 	
 		yeah well the
 		right well he's been doing a long term he's being called a consultant and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits he doesn't get well we don't care about retirement benefits he doesn't get um vacation benefits and he does a lot of things that
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		get factored into somebody else's salary so really his salary should be you know twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that you know it's a less long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah and they'll do it
