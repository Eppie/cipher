 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what kind of garden do you have
 	
 	
 		well we've tried having let me turn the TV off we've tried having uh
 		vegetable garden and i'm from Chicago and the way that uh bug bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from Chicago
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and we have tried several years in a row and we've given up between the fire ants the pill bugs the weeds the drought and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer and we just kind of uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought who'd want to eat that stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here and uh if you really water a lot you can do it but you know when you have to pay for water it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you have a lawn
 	
 	
 		so right now we're just yeah we we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now and the trees  we have a peach tree that's the extent of our um contributing to our food supply
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but that's nice to have but yeah yeah so what do you do up there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well um actually  it we've sort of had an ideal Spring
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and um the the peonies have been out for now about three weeks and the roses have been blooming for two weeks and the grass is uh this lush green and of course i've got lots of weeds in mine because i don't use any poison either
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um you know i just keep looking at and i say jeez you know this is the first year it's been so perfect
 	
 	
 		really gosh
 	
 	
 		but and my garden you know  my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		the plants and
 	
 	
 		that sounds wonderful
 	
 	
 		you know i'm going i'm going gee this can't you know we'll have a freeze
 	
 	
 		if you don't have a frost you'll be all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's what i remember from living up north is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost and half the stuff would get frostbitten and you'd have to
 	
 	
 		well that's it last year i think it was you know my peonies were were budding in January and you know there was no way that was going to make it and sure enough you know we did had really mild weather until
 	
 	
 		wow uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think it was May or something and then you know everything just got hit hard
 	
 	
 		oh boy that's frustrating
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so but yeah it it's interesting and i enjoy gardening my son does the mowing of the grass
 	
 	
 		oh yeah my husband does that thank goodness because i that's not a pleasure for me
 	
 	
 		i don't think that's a pleasure for anybody the mowing the mowing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		i love gardens that are well tended and i just there's been a few different places i've lived where i've just
 		i don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what but you could just tell that they had a love uh a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers and just i love the host of colors that just keep coming all you know year long
 		and uh i i was in England once and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it you know it could be three feet by four feet or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i do admire that but i haven't really put uh too much energy into it course we have two little kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are two and three years old so
 	
 	
 		oh they help you
 	
 	
 		so that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry i'll tell you
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh but that's nice you know i mean the peach tree is is a start and
 	
 	
 		that yeah that's really lovely i would love to have different fruit trees
 		it's it's been wonderful to have the peaches they're just delicious and we we have we have still have to spray some but we don't have to just asphyxiate asphyxiate ourself with the poison which is good because i just i can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards
 	
 	
 		right what about tomatoes aren't they pretty hardy
 	
 	
 		um we've tried them but again it's just like the sun scorch we've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the sun i mean it's just
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		see you really really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and installed that and um that's really what makes the most sense because you don't have to use so much water and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it really does the job but it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and if you're not really committed to it i mean me i'm you know i'm real committed to it for about a week and then i forget about it for a week and then i go oh yeah i need to do something and by then it's burned up you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives so maybe when i get older i'll find uh some joy in that
 	
 	
 		well i would assume assume too i mean you've got three or four months you're talking about of
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of bad weather
 	
 	
 		yeah it just gets so hot so fast here we don't have really a Spring or a Fall and it just um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		immediately heats up so that's one thing i miss about living up north as i remember
 		um you know the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather you know it was really nice
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we always had gardens when i was uh living in Chicago in fact my mother once tore up our entire back yard
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and redid it i'll never forget got my stepfather to put in uh a waterfall and a little pond in one corner i mean that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever knew him
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they remodeled the entire back yard then they sold the house and got divorced so i don't know what that says about it all
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh but she used to love to do stuff like that
 	
 	
 		sounds like it would have been pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah it really was i enjoyed it there
 		but maybe when the boys get a little older we'll do some more planting because they like to see things grow they've done a couple of little seed projects and
 		so i think it will be fun for them
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well it sounds like you you've got your hands full
 	
 	
 		oh yes  they're both running around now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and you know gardening isn't isn't high on the list but it's not off the list
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's very therapeutic i think really to get out there and dig in the dirt you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they certainly enjoy that part of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's just trying to keep anything i planted bulbs last uh Fall on the side guard and when i went out there in the Spring
 		and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		he thought what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we use to didn't eat them i mean i guess i could be thankful for that
 	
 	
 		right maybe next year they'll do better
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah really if they survive this year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		oh well good luck to you nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay well thanks it was nice talking to you too bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
