 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		okay are you currently active in any type of exercise program
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		you're not
 	
 	
 		no i get enough without having to do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if i exercised i'd be too thin
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i just have one of those metabolisms that um
 	
 	
 		doesn't require exercise
 	
 	
 		doesn't require it really if i if yeah
 	
 	
 		i i wish i had such luck
 	
 	
 		well i think you kind of are born with those type of genes
 	
 	
 		my wife is that way i uh
 		course i've always uh i've always been in fairly good condition but and i do exercise uh lately i've been off of it because i've had shoulder problems but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that seems to be on the mend and i think i'm pretty close to getting back on a program again
 	
 	
 		well i did have a program of walking because i enjoyed doing it in the evening and i had a dog at that time and i walked him
 		and i kind of lost like ten pounds and i said whoa  better stop
 	
 	
 		i do notice as i get older i i tend to i you know i don't exercise like i like i used to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's much much harder for me to control you know the few pounds here and there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so whenever i do have to lose five or ten pounds whatever it's a major effort
 		whereas i could used to just lay off two or three meals uh
 		you know for a day or so and then you know i could lose you know five pounds
 		now i'd have to do that for two solid weeks before i'd lose five pounds so
 	
 	
 		well my daughter really uh is into uh fitness uh of course she's in uh the nursing profession and she knows how beneficial it is even though she says mom you
 		you know you really need to exercise because it does a lot for your body other than maintain your wealthy your weight
 	
 	
 		um i think it's important when they when they talk about you know getting your heart rate up and
 	
 	
 		yes and and she has a very strenuous um
 		exercise mode that she keeps herself in plus she has um a family that she takes care of and a forty hour work week so i'm really amazed at her stamina
 		but she um has inherited uh a little problem from her father's side because he did have a weight problem
 		but he maintains his weight now because he jogs like uh nine miles a day
 	
 	
 		nine
 	
 	
 		yeah and he gets that adrenalin high and i guess that really i've never reached it  um
 	
 	
 		i used to run uh you know quite heavy i used to i used to run like three and maybe four miles
 		three or four times a week
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh over the years of the pounding and everything else my knees just don't support it any more
 		so i've i do walk and i do ride my bike and we do have a workout facility here at work and i do i used to be on a fairly rigorous uh weight lifting program and and uh riding the bike the stationary bike
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but uh then i started i think it was just from
 		trying to lift too much
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i started getting the shoulder problems and uh so i've been off now for about four months
 	
 	
 		well i think the old adage is quite true in this case with exercise that moderation is the key
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		if you know your limits and you stay within those limits i think that you and you're happy with the exercise that you do because i think it's um very imperative that you have a happy
 		um attitude about exercise otherwise it becomes a chore and a task and and you you think of it as work and um
 		it doesn't
 		really uh do a lot for you but if you think of it as a uh
 		a source of uh well being and health and uh uh have a positive attitude i think you you go a long way with that
 	
 	
 		the one thing's i mean i enjoy doing it i i enjoy any kind of any any kind of outdoor uh activity exercise whatever and in fact i used i do it during lunch i i really look forward to it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i did overdo it and i know it and i keep trying to tell myself that i'm not twenty years old any more i can't i just can't keep up and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i and i've got to learn just you know when i get to a certain point i use use it to maintain i'm not i'm not after
 		uh you know the uh twenty year old body any more i'm not uh
 		i'm just not geared that way
 	
 	
 		you're just uh focused then on on maintaining your health because if you do the exercise naturally you're going to feel a lot healthier
 	
 	
 		yeah on just staying in condition and uh
 		but i had my uh cholesterol was down to
 		it was
 		i think around a hundred and twenty two
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah very good my my blood pressure was real good
 	
 	
 		that's very good
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh my uh percent body fat was less than eighteen percent
 	
 	
 		well that's marvelous
 	
 	
 		so i mean overall i was in very good shape now after four months of being off exercise i've put on probably fifteen pounds
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and taking on you know taking on quite some bad habits of snacking and everything else so i know i've got a major event
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh once i get back i think probably within a couple of weeks i'll be able to get back to it again
 	
 	
 		well i think the way you're talking now that you're already motivated for that goal
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know it's got to happen uh i'm i'm slowly growing out of my wardrobe so i have no choice i can't afford a new one so
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		but it's
 		it's something i've done pretty much all my life i uh i played college ball and and i've i've always liked
 		staying in shape and it just really bothers me when i'm not
 		so uh
 		and and and plus it's just important
 	
 	
 		i think it does a lot for your mental um exercise too uh keeping um a clear mind i think your mind is clearer when you exercise
 	
 	
 		well i sleep better at night i think clearly you know i'm
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		doing something
 		uh
 		i just
 		i have real poor self-esteem if i know that i haven't done something
 		i just feel lazy and i feel like i've cheated myself
 		and and i've gone through four months of that and i'm kind of like you know it's time to get back on
 	
 	
 		yeah and you'd have yeah
 		you've
 		you've beat your head yourself over the head long enough
 	
 	
 		yeah i i hate it i really do i hate it
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 		yeah and it has an effect on your family life too
 	
 	
 		that too and  like i said my wife is one of those you know she could sit down and eat a whole choco late cake
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh  not show
 	
 	
 		and and never never show a an ounce of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she's got one of those fast metabolisms my daughter does too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i see them eat
 		and then i'm of course i'm impelled also
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		that just that that seems to be the worst the worst thing i have a problem with is i tend to like food way too much
 		and uh back when back when i was working out when i got home i didn't tend to want to eat this much i was i came home i felt satisfied i'd get out and work a little bit in the yard i'd come in i'm hot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm a little bit tired and i'd just and i'd just grab a a salad or a snack or something like that and then
 		that would be the end of it
 	
 	
 		well uh one of uh eating is one of the joys of life you know and uh
 	
 	
 		it is for me
 	
 	
 		yeah well it is for a lot of people and uh you you surely should get satisfaction out of eating you know because you socialize and you're maintaining your your body uh you're you're maintaining all of your
 		uh faculties that run the body your brain and your flesh and your bones and all of that and eating is a pleasure
 		that is one of the basic uh motivators in life is eating
 	
 	
 		yep that's for sure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh
 		i've got to get on the wagon and i know it but i like i said i mean i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i have probably three people in my neighborhood who enjoy running and walking and riding the bikes and stuff like that so i mean there's there's plenty of opportunities
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure and they've got these
 	
 	
 		i just have to do it
 	
 	
 		marvelous health clubs too that you know you can use their facilities
 	
 	
 		yeah we in fact we've got several of them uh you know within just a couple of miles
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		in fact uh you know TI has a real good one right there in in Lewisville
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh-huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		not too far from where i live so that that
 		that's something i can use
 	
 	
 		oh sure certainly
 	
 	
 		so well
 		i guess that's about all i can say about exercising
 	
 	
 		well that's fine i think we covered quite a bit
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well it was a joy
 	
 	
 		it was nice talking with you
 	
 	
 		same here take care bye-bye
 	
 	
 		take care bye-bye
