 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay can you uh give me your thoughts on what
 		women's roles are or how they've changed
 	
 	
 		well um
 		i'm in my i i i've seen the changes i think in my generation most of all because i'm a early baby boomer
 		and uh i was brought up
 		uh to sort of get married and raise children and uh be very domestic
 		and uh when i went to college or went to high school i did very well i was urged to become a secretary or a teacher because those are typical roles
 		and uh things have changed and
 		i i've ventured off in all sorts of areas and so have most of the other women in my generation
 		and we're all in business or
 		the professions and uh and uh heavens we're  we're uh
 		astronauts and things like that who know who would wouldn't have been imagined in nineteen sixty eight or something
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		yeah well i was kind of same thing it's you know i was i was brought up in a small town and and women tended to just get married and take care of the house
 		um but as as times changed
 		um the price of things i guess started rising and it took more than one income
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so more um more and more
 		of young women were staying in school they were getting a better education and they were going out into the work force
 	
 	
 		yes
 		another thing that happened that i found is that you know when i got married i didn't know anybody who had ever been divorced or or when i was younger i didn't know anybody who had ever been divorced
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in this day and age people are as likely to get divorced as to stay married
 		and very often the woman has to be able to earn a decent living
 		and uh so there's an additional reason for her to be capable of holding down a good job
 	
 	
 		yeah i think perhaps uh um years ago it was a stigma
 		on a family to have a divorce in it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and whether it was warranted or not people just stayed together because of what the family thought uh
 		people little bit smarter today than that they uh uh yes there's a family unit and it's and it's very difficult if there uh are children especially young children
 		but in a lot of cases it's probably it would probably more difficult if they stayed together
 		but uh i think women are taking a uh a more active role in politics i i think that uh
 		within the next ten or fifteen years you'll probably see a woman vice president or a woman president
 		and you'll also see a lot more uh congressmen and senators uh women
 	
 	
 		i i agree with that and i also think that they're taking a lead in in the arts and in business too
 		and uh
 		as as the years go by they run surveys to see how many women are CEOs or on the boards of major companies and the number is creeping up very
 		slowly but it's definitely increasing so that probably ten years from now
 	
 	
 		is that right you think they you think that's the case
 	
 	
 		yes it is i mean ten fifteen ten fifteen years ago there were no women
 		on the boards or or or CEO's of major corporations unless they inherited the firm from their father you know that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah if it was if it was a family owned business you mean
 	
 	
 		but right if it was a family owned business but now they're they're in the board room and they're trying to get ahead
 		and make it in the business world of course to some extent the laws are helping them
 		but uh uh you know there's no no no holding back their ambition on the other hand what it does to the fabric of society and the family remains to be seen
 	
 	
 		yeah i still i still think it's it's uh it's a two tiered system i uh
 		i know of of uh women engineers and and
 		uh supervisors that are
 		uh they have to work twice as hard it seems like to achieve the same levels that a male does
 		uh i don't know if that's just my imagination or not but it seems to be that's uh
 		the ones that are up there
 		seem to have a little bit more intelligence than their counterparts
 	
 	
 		i i i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		if there was if it was up to me i think i would have uh more females because it seems like they try harder
 	
 	
 		well i think that in a way they're they're being tested right now we're going through a testing period
 		where capability is is everything and if
 		they succeed then the the the generation of girls that are growing up now will have it much easier
 		because there will be a precedent they'll have had role models whereas you know the generation that grew up in the sixties and seventies
 	
 	
 		right they'll have role models they'll have protectors
 	
 	
 		sorry
 	
 	
 		they'll have protectors
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh there'll be more and more women that are up higher and higher
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um
 		and also they say that the bulk of the wealth
 		is controlled by women now
 		uh just through i guess uh uh
 		the men dying off and just leaving their uh fortunes to women
 		so that's going to have a big impact uh
 		if you've got money and brains you can you can wield a lot of power
 	
 	
 		um i guess just by virtue of living longer in a way you're right because they do it does does come to them but they've got to be young enough to enjoy it i mean if they're just
 		old ladies sitting around waiting for the end to come it doesn't do them much good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it must be the culture's different uh down there than up here also
 		um they're kind of uh
 		the old Yankees
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know it it takes uh uh it takes a stick of dynamite to get them moving off center in a lot of cases
 		where uh
 		the Midwest i think is a little bit more aggressive because they're closer to the west coast
 		where they're uh highly aggressive
 		you know uh ideas and or it seems like new ideas start out there and then kind of work their way east i don't know if you've found that to be true
 	
 	
 		well i'm in the middle of the country and and it seems to me they could they start their from start from both coasts and work their ways inward
 		uh one of the one of the things that that i'm finding is that i've lived
 		in Texas i've lived in New York and uh i
 		have i've done a lot of visiting out in California and i know that we're lagging behind here and yet i really do see
 		uh women's roles have increased and they're gaining new respect in fact
 		i believe that the mayor of the top five major Texas cities
 		are all women
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and that goes back to your original point about politics
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh uh you know it's going to get to a point i some men are going to wonder if they're falling behind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		the uh
 		i think the only problem there is the men that themselves that feel threatened by by a woman
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh by her intelligence probably
 		uh those are the ones that you're going to have problems with i think uh
 		a lot of the at least my kids they seem to have a a more open mind
 		today than uh like when i was growing up
 	
 	
 		i think the young people today do have an open mind it's just not as much
 		uh
 		typecasting by sex by gender
 		uh
 		you know uh a little girl can say i want to be an astronaut or i want to be a fireman or a policeman or
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		or a Rhodes scholar which was impossible when i was going to college uh Rhodes
