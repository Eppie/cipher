 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you in the market for a car recently
 	
 	
 		yeah i just bought a car
 	
 	
 		oh what'd you get
 	
 	
 		i got a nineteen eighty three Cavalier station wagon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what what convinced you to get that one
 	
 	
 		well a a friend of my father's and he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh incredible how many miles on it
 	
 	
 		it's like it has a hundred and fifty three thousand
 	
 	
 		and it's still running real well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh great yeah we have um right now we have two cars um i have my husband and myself we have two sons who are drivers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and one of which is a um an eighty eight Plymouth Voyager Van and then we have um about a year ago we picked up a second hand uh uh Audi
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and uh that was a car you know a car a sedan and uh we got that i don't i'll
 		the major things the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova and a well my son was driving and someone came into his lane and hit
 		him and fortunately he was able to his i mean he was checked out of the hospital was out of the hospital by that night but the car was completely totaled
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and Mike and they had been my sons two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that which was hit by another car
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i mean i got i was getting really nervous so i finally said we i want a really solid car
 		so we found the Audi second hand i guess right now my criteria for cars is uh uh solid being solid able to take an impact
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh so uh i we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but the the things that i would want would be a solid car another thing i'd definitely want would be antilock brakes
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh our our van which is a a delight to drive does not have i i think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just are terrible
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um if the road is at all wet and i'm and i don't go all that fast but the uh it it just doesn't hold it doesn't hold well at all
 		so uh i i definitely would want to get antilock brakes so i don't know uh do you have any particular things that
 		that are priorities on your list
 	
 	
 		well it's i didn't really need power windows but it has power you know windows and steering and air conditioning and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess down there air conditioning's a must isn't it
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh yeah it it has a stereo and a cassette player and um it he's told me it gets forty two miles to gallon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's incredible that is incredible
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh we we get about our the uh van gets on highways can get about twenty eight the Audi does not have good mileage that's the one drawback it's a powerful car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		but it does not uh i mean i if i'm on a highway and i can get twenty twenty one miles in per gallon
 		i consider that lucky i'm lucky maybe maybe sometimes i've gotten twenty two it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and that's a to me is a real drawback i wish i would you know i could settle for twenty eight or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh the um the frills on that car are nice but they're not necessary for me except air conditioning in this area uh in Washington DC area it gets hot and humid
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		really um-hum it's really humid
 	
 	
 		yeah uh so air conditioning is definitely uh definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer um but i um
 		i i don't need uh you know power windows are nice but i don't need them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		although i must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads come into a toll road push that button down it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up instead of having to crank it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		crank yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah but or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to open if you're alone in the car just to press buttons and but you know i've lived all these years without them i probably could have lived a little longer
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		you don't have to stretch
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh one of the things that we have uh we've liked when we've gotten a new car and this this used car has it is a sun roof
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and those are really nice in in good weather
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so uh so i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have antilock antilock brakes i'd love to get uh an air bag
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a sun roof
 		and uh just so it'd be a good solid car i guess that's those are my my major criteria everything else is you know a luxury and they make the car more expensive but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		so uh but if you were to buy a new car now a brand new car what would you look for
 	
 	
 		um yeah like you said antilock brakes and air bag and uh i'd i'd really like to have a car that's dependable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that that you drive you know like a
 		
 
 		American made car that's as dependable as Mercedes or something you know that's
 	
 	
 		isn't that true it's it's funny um
 		uh that you use uh the Audi's German and i have to say it has been pretty dependable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah sometimes one advantage of an American made car is if you get stuck anywhere most local garages can fix you up
 	
 	
 		yeah they have parts uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but once you get if you start once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really and the parts i know the Audi parts are terribly expensive
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i mean it just i shudder i would not get the Audi again just for that reason
 		but i would love i wish an American an American that you know engineering would make something as solid as a German car
 		you know we certainly have the technology but it's amazing when we bought this Audi i mean everything is more solid in it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh it you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i know and i i and i'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a for a solid car i don't think i have to give up as much as i'm giving up
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh do you need air conditioning down there
 	
 	
 		yes we really do because even today it's it's supposed to get up into the nineties so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh we've had eleven days in a row over ninety
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well listen i enjoyed talking with you
 	
 	
 		it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay and enjoy enjoy your car
 	
 	
 		yeah have a nice summer
 	
 	
 		
 
 		thank you you too it's going to be a hot one okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		yeah bye
