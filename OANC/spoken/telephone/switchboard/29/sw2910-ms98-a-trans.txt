 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think i get most of my news uh in headlines from the radio and then i follow up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention
 	
 	
 		well i i do about the same i guess but in a different fashion i i i'm from New York originally and now that i live in Florida i live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the in the summertime
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i i feel that the the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the New York Times i've always read the New York Times when i was younger and i try to find now that it has a national edition i read that i also read uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i i guess i do watch uh McNeil Lehrer on P B S because i i lean to that coverage and and i've guess i'm
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i like them but they take so long i don't always have time
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah that's a whole hour show actually it's an hour show each evening and and uh we we turn it on when we start dinner we seem to start dinner around six and finish it up
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i find that i'm leaning on uh i travel a great deal uh even overseas and i find that i lean on uh C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff and i'm
 		i'm i i'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out i mean i i don't believe everything they say but it's it's coverage you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i think C N N does a pretty good job i had not watched them very much except when i was abroad until the Gulf War
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they seemed to have the best coverage they had more information sooner than most of the other networks
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well yeah i i i uh Peter Arnett was reporting direct from uh Iraq i think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him i i think that what he he reported what he saw and if you didn't like it that was just too bad you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well uh i know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted but i think they said that frequently enough that  you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective uh
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah i mean i
 		no
 		that that's right i think so and and i guess if it comes to um to magazines i don't read i used to when i was younger i subscribed to Time and U S News and World Report i i have seemed to
 		slide away from that and rely more on the local paper or
 		i i i also subscribe to something called World Press which is uh a magazine that only talks about other uh excerpts from the world press which sort of gives you a different slant than it's not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		as slanted as the New York Times or as biased perhaps as a local paper
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh that i guess and the radio uh i listen to P B S radio a lot and i also listen to uh these twenty four hour news stations when i'm driving i
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a C B S twenty four hour station that i listen to on the way to and from work and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you read uh are you from southern or northern California
 	
 	
 		northern i'm from uh the peninsula Palo Alto
 	
 	
 		so so well
 		yeah is that what is that the San Francisco paper out there is uh the major paper
 	
 	
 		well it's horrible The San Francisco paper is just wretched
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a terrible paper
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i subscribe to the San Jose Mercury News um uh Palo Alto is about midway between well it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco paper and
 	
 	
 		is that pretty good
 		oh the what is that the Chronicle isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah there's the Chronicle and the Examiner but they're uh both run by the same people
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah they just they really are probably the worse papers i've ever read i
 	
 	
 		they're just horrid so we read the
 	
 	
 		yeah well can you get the L A paper up there that's a pretty decent paper isn't it or
 	
 	
 		uh we can but i don't like it so we subscribe to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and the Mercury News
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah well that's another one i read i forgot that i read the Wall Street Journal not as in depth as i used to because they their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer but
 	
 	
 		yes well again i read that uh  two columns on the front
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah uh i think i i agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff i feel pretty well versed in in what i'm doing because i i do spend more time on that than i do say on sports or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		although i watch that i spend a lot of time reading about these things i'm quite interested i find it very exciting to for the coverage we have now today
 	
 	
 		yes and i think we do get pretty good coverage i don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the uh the news coverage
 	
 	
 		the
 		if anything they i think they listen
 	
 	
 		we almost have too much
 	
 	
 		well i don't know i i hear a lot of criticism about listening to these the Dan Rathers of the world and and listening and taking their word for it or their comment actually they i think they slant things but
 	
 	
 		well i cannot stand Dan Rather i remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston and i hated him then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no kidding oh well i didn't know that yeah
 	
 	
 		and i would not watch that man for money and  he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah was was  he
 	
 	
 		uh i watch Peter Jennings and uh and Tom Brokaw sort of alternate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well how do you feel about it i guess i i got to say if that's the subject if the subject is do i feel that we're well enough equipped to i don't know if if it said that i feel i'm well enough equipped
 	
 	
 		do we get enough news or something like that do we get uh the do we get the news that we want and i do i really think
 	
 	
 		yeah to yeah
 		yeah i think i do too i think you have to let uh you yous got to segregate some of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's about all i have to say
 	
 	
 		okay well nice to talk to you bye bye
 	
 	
 		nice talking to you bye bye
