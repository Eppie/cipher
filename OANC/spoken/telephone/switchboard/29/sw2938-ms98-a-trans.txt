 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there
 	
 	
 		um we've got
 		quite a few actually what we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city uh we've actually had some warnings in uh Raleigh uh on air pollution
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		oh you mean
 		for like smog and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh because of there're so many cars and we have a belt line along around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and um you know it's it's still it's just surrounding the city and you can actually see it there's a couple of uh tall buildings in Raleigh and and you can actually you know they're blurred they're even dark and what it is is the pollution
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 		what do you think of that uh the
 		greenhouse effect that's going on
 	
 	
 		well i guess that's fluorocarbons the fluorocarbons and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's causing the hole in the ozone
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's very serious i mean we can we're even feeling the effects of the weather from uh uh the shift in the jet stream
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it it is scary though isn't it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i mean uh the last two uh years our winters have been absolutely nothing i mean maybe one snow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		well all right North Carolina that's up there by Kentucky isn't it
 	
 	
 		Kentucky uh North Carolina is all the way on the east coast it's further west than Georgia it's uh right below Virginia
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 		okay well Kentucky's next to Virginia i'm pretty sure well i'm from Kentucky i should know but i don't i'm sorry but Kentucky we use to have severe i mean just real cold cold winters and we'd have three and four feet of snow course here in Texas
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they don't have snow they don't know what snow is they freak out when there's snow on the ground  oh Amarillo well that's close to here how long have you been in Raleigh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  originally i'm from Texas so i mean Amarillo so uh uh-huh
 		yeah real close
 		um i've been out of Texas about ten years
 	
 	
 		well how old are you
 	
 	
 		oh twenty uh seven  i almost forgot my age oh really
 	
 	
 		okay well we're the same age  yeah i forget my age all the time so that's okay it's i think it's just something that goes with the territory  but to me Texas see and Kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school okay
 	
 	
 		hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in Texas i'm serious if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain i i swear they close everything down i just laugh i mean i do they get i mean and traffic slows down to nothing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		actually they've been doing the same thing here it's you know it's kind of funny they um i guess northerners are different but even uh North Carolinians they don't know how to handle cold weather
 	
 	
 		oh well no northern i'm from the north that's why i said we in Kentucky we i don't know you just get used to weather and of course the people down in south they don't they're not used to cold weather and stuff and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it just i don't know i just laugh everytime they have a
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		everytime they have snow on the ground everything's closed up and you know you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		do you all have much pollution there
 	
 	
 		no not really i mean not to see it now of course there's you know TI is here Oscar Mayer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there is a few factories but i don't see much pollution going on
 	
 	
 		well you know what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well see they have that um uh what is it a vet test or something like that they call it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh that's supposed to cut down on it
 	
 	
 		well supposedly that's supposed to catch it but i'll tell you what and even these buses oh lord it's real bad these buses in Raleigh
 	
 	
 		yeah school buses and the commercial buses yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		i mean school buses are notorious
 	
 	
 		well they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		it it gets bad
 	
 	
 		well you know what they've started doing is is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that way it gets above um other cars on the road
 	
 	
 		well that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		and uh it really does make a difference although it it settles you know even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road that's that's even more miserable i would i'd have to go out to the country to jog
 	
 	
 		well uh the you know pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway
 	
 	
 		no i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		because of that smoke fumes when i was pregnant with my first little boy i had read it because back then i was walking back and forth to Kentucky from well not back and forth i was walking home from uh
 		the college i was going to in Kentucky and i was having to walk along the highway it was just one day a week but it was in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i have no sense of smell so i couldn't smell this but
 		it would make me sick and i'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway
 	
 	
 		hum
 		uh-huh
 		golly that's
 	
 	
 		but yeah it's yeah it's all the exhaust uh well that was four years ago too it's probably a lot worse now yeah
 	
 	
 		that's bad
 		oh i'm sure well they um you can really feel it you know in your breathing even normal people and if you're older um i mean you can really
 		deplete your oxygen and it'll you know pass out and it's you know it's killed several people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you uh
 		smoke
 	
 	
 		um actually i'm a very i just smoke one in the evening if that so i'm a very very light smoker
 	
 	
 		well yeah it's kind of like
 	
 	
 		it was kind of funny  they were doing some uh ozone testing and uh the the EPA and they were just screening some candidates
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i don't think i'd ever you know do that but they uh asked me if i was a smoker and i didn't fit into the smoker's category and i didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category um it was you know i was just one of those
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah because you do smoke one a day
 	
 	
 		yeah in between people so that kind of threw them off
 	
 	
 		hum uh
 	
 	
 		but they're doing a lot of research here uh the EPA
 	
 	
 		for the air pollution
 	
 	
 		for ozone and oh yeah all that they're they're real big into it they've got Research Triangle Park here
 		and they're you know they're just doing a lot of uh lot of stuff
 	
 	
 		huh
 		but they i don't hear much about it down here course Texas we don't have a bunch of  pollution but too we've got that air coming in off the coast and you know it'd blow it up north
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 		oh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but no it'd seem like it would be the same way in on the California coastline wouldn't it
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i think i would hate to live in California the smog there i mean i can't believe they have warnings here which it it's mainly just when it gets real real hot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		but they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially
 	
 	
 		really well well that's kind of good to know because i thought Lord i thought i lived in a halfway decent area
 	
 	
 		i think they do that for most everybody it's especially it's usually for the young children and the older
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		the old people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		older old people
 	
 	
 		well you ought to come to North Carolina it's a big change  yeah
 	
 	
 		it is
 	
 	
 		there's no trees where i was from in Amarillo and here they've got the mountains the beach the trees you know it's they've got streams rivers ponds it's really pretty here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		oh well this is pretty wooded area down here so in in a lot of parts yeah i know Texas is supposed to be flat but they've got you know down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of uh
 	
 	
 		is it
 		um-hum
 		Sherman and Denison do you know my grandparents live in Durant
 	
 	
 		they do  they live close then in Durant Oklahoma
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah real close i go there yeah
 	
 	
 		you go where
 		uh you go to visit them
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah we used to go fishing in Lake Texoma
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah well down by Lake Texoma there's a bunch of wooded area this but Kentucky's beautiful they've got trees and trees are supposed to you know purify you know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff it's a philodendron
 	
 	
 		huh huh-uh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		it's supposed to filter the air for you in your home i had one my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months ago four months ago yeah i do  yeah i do
 	
 	
 		well i'm going to have to get some
 		um-hum do you smoke
 		do you
 		did you smoke when you when you were pregnant
 	
 	
 		yeah i did i couldn't make myself quit i did cut down a lot  i got i've i've got one vice and smoke is smoking is it i don't i don't drink and i try not to cuss and i don't i do
 	
 	
 		well i mean i can understand that actually
 		well
 		
 
 	
 	
 		very little and smoking i just i got in the habit of it when i was about thirteen
 	
 	
 		yeah well one thing i miss is uh is the people from Texas are are you know i miss their morals their values and everything it's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah we're down here at the Bible belt aren't we uh i wasn't saved until i got down here and people down here are just there's so many Christians and it's so
 		different from Kentucky but
 	
 	
 		um-hum how'd you get involved in this research
 	
 	
 		um i worked at TI for a while but then my brother-in-law works there and he got me into it
 	
 	
 		oh i see huh
 	
 	
 		how'd you get into it
 	
 	
 		um i i was taking a voice IO class
 		and um and actually doing some research and so they told me about this project
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well it's fun i like talking to new people and i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		half the time well a couple of times i've been interrupted by my little girl i've had to hang up and stuff but i enjoy it i talked people from well Carolina well Carolina now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		up in uh Boston and New York well Boston is New York isn't it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh no Boston's above uh-huh
 	
 	
 		no Boston Massachusetts  but i've talked to people in New York but i've talked to a lot of people in Texas
 		because i guess it's because of TI's down here
 	
 	
 		yeah i've talked to a lot of people in Texas i had one call from actually from Charlotte North Carolina and Virginia and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i can't remember where all
 		um up north like you said i think one was from Boston
 	
 	
 		well
 		with Boston i love their accent  i do i love a Boston accent accent i met a girl from Boston one time my husband was in the service so we went from
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and his family's down here we're out of the service now but yeah he got out of it his unit right after Panama we went to Panama he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh i bet you're glad
 		uh-huh
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		and uh he
