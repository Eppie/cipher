 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well uh it seems to me that uh that i don't know whether the jury system uh i i shouldn't say i don't know i don't feel very
 		uh stronger that the jury system should be changed it seems to have worked uh uh time immemorial and when uh difficult decisions uh are made uh uh uh they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on
 		uh i know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh a unanimous verdict isn't required and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people they're down to as little small as six people in i think in petty in in uh in uh minor felonies
 		and uh and misdemeanor trials
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		i think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because
 		uh there's always uh there's there's always a jury that might be swayed uh by the moment uh to either be too lenient or too vengeful i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah on the other hand uh attorney uh uh justices are more apt to uh understand you know the crime the prison crowding problems and things like that and have that sway their decisions one way or the other
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i mean isn't that uh is that a reflection then of what's really happening in the real world if if if they keep giving everybody
 	
 	
 		you know
 		uh
 	
 	
 		hundred year sentences and the people in various states it doesn't seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons or even in for that matter
 		uh repair the uh the lack of judges and and and other uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's what's happening i think uh the judges
 		are trying to save the people from having to the cost of new prisons they're
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah you know that might be it i mean they they certainly
 	
 	
 		there saying oh well you know the the people can't afford it
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't know how it is in Virginia but in Florida now uh uh uh at eighteen years someone was just sentenced to eighteen years i heard on Today
 		uh without any specific recommendation for uh uh uh uh uh uh
 		uh waving the normal uh procedures and the eighteen years will uh translate into something like uh four point seven if every if the if the prisoner is a model prisoner and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		prevail plus i guess there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		so uh yeah you might be right about that i i i do not know it just seems to me that only about uh from what i read only about ninety percent of the cases only about ten percent of the  cases come for trial anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh only about uh four four four or five percent of uh in the in the very end or less than
 		less than half the trials that go to uh uh less than half the cases that go to trial uh end up with with uh with the jury actually making the verdict
 	
 	
 		with a conviction
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		that most of it's plea bargained uh half way through or or uh most of the cases are plea bargained anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh uh how do you feel about the about the jury system itself do you you think that should be changed or do do you know in Virginia whether it's if they have smaller juries or
 	
 	
 		um i don't know exactly what the size of the juries i know one of my friends was uh uh brought up for jury duty for and he only heard very you know piddly type cases
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		most of it was uh
 		robberies or things like that you know it wasn't any serious crimes so apparently even for the smallest crimes they give the person the you know any felony anyways they they give the person the option for a jury
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess we do
 		yeah i guess we always focus on criminal trials with with the jury but
 		i know you have a right to ask for a jury in in any sort of a case that even where damages are
 		are are uh are are the results of some sort of a uh an action that you're bringing against someone else you can ask for that to be heard before a jury takes a heck of a long time i guess to get there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in some states i i i don't know uh i should imagine Virginia from what i read uh uh is like every other state it it's faced with uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system because i guess everywhere i read that there's a shortage of judges
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		not that they won't appoint them but there's no budget for them i guess or
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk uh or clerks
 	
 	
 		yeah whatever
 	
 	
 		so it seems uh no i i i don't think i'd change it the more i verbalize it i i don't think i'd want to change the system
 	
 	
 		right uh i don't think i would either
 	
 	
 		i don't know what we'd replace it with
 	
 	
 		yeah i know it uh does seem like the the
 		the the purpose of getting people in jail so that you know the the i can't think of the word i'm looking for anyways the deterrent
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		for people to to commit the crime uh to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away people have i don't know they just don't care any more the benefit i guess of crime outweighs what the deterrent is you know people that
 	
 	
 		uh and yet there are there are so many there are so many people in prison i mean the prison population uh as far as i i uh you know my impression of it is that it's that it's doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		i mean it so so i guess our population has grown some too but there there definitely is uh uh you know to me the one of the worst things that could ever happen uh from what i read and see and understand i mean i don't think i could handle prison
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'd be interested in finding out what the uh
 	
 	
 		i mean it was very difficult
 	
 	
 		percentage of drug related type things are and uh
 	
 	
 		well there must be a a  a a a very great degree of that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but there again i i don't know if the the jury system itself uh comes in to play there i would think that one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability of course that it's a constitutional right that the press
 		must have here is the the interviewing of jurors after the trial i mean that it seems to me that
 		that that when a jury makes a decision they shouldn't be asked uh before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision i mean i don't
 	
 	
 		huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		i imagine there's a certain certain right of the press to have
 		the ability to ask that but i i would think i if i did anything i'd protect the juror from
 		from any sort of an inquisition after
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i know uh on the other hand though when uh after the Barry trial up here you know that was a big local trial as well as national
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh yeah yeah well i do a lot of business up in Washington i was there during the during the trial actually yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and the opposite was true of me uh after the case was over i was like somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they did you know it was like well pictures isn't good enough we want to see i don't know what they wanted i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		they want the guy to i don't know i mean just because you feel like he was being kicked on which he certainly was
 		you know i think uh no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted
 	
 	
 		oh i felt that way i felt i felt
 	
 	
 		but it doesn't matter the guy was obviously guilty
 	
 	
 		no but
 		yeah i always balanced in the in the situation i remember the jurors uh
 		i thought to myself how did how did they only i think they only found uh found him guilty on one count which was uh not even which was a class something felony which was not even punishable
 	
 	
 		one one count
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh uh to the degree that they thought it but i don't know maybe when you're there in the room in the courtroom yourself and you're sitting there and you've got to make a judgment on somebody
 		and the prosecutors do a lousy job or maybe the evidence was as sensational as the media presented it i mean i i'm not making excuses for
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that might be it
 	
 	
 		well yeah i think we're getting
 	
 	
 		but i think i'm getting a call coming in
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right nice talking with you thank you
 	
 	
 		well it's been nice talking to you um-hum bye-bye
