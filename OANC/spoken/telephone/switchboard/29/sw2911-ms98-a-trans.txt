 		yes they do very good uh comparable i used to work for TI and i used to work for Martin Marietta and they are comparable to them um as good or better
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what do do you work
 	
 	
 		no i don't
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh i said my husband works on the railroad they've got
 		a lot of benefits but it's expensive
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		this uh the insurance is a kick in the tail every month
 		
 
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i uh my insurance is is very reasonable where i work and course the
 	
 	
 		it would
 		well the insurance is good we only have to pay like a hundred dollar deductible per year it's just it's uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's like a hundred dollars a month
 	
 	
 		oh is it really
 	
 	
 		yeah well i mean well that's just
 	
 	
 		well i i chose an HMO and mine only runs five dollars a uh five dollars a month
 	
 	
 		well this is uh like retirement benefits and it's a bunch of different benefits in one it's not just
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		it's not just medical insurance
 	
 	
 		okay well i pay five dollars a month for my medical and then we have a retirement uh
 		benefits package a profit sharing type of thing they match our uh we can put in up to fifteen percent and they'll match uh sixteen six percent one hundred percent you know so that is that's better than most companies do
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		yeah that's good
 	
 	
 		plus plus they you know we have bonds we have a credit union it's a fairly it's not a real large company well it is it's part of a large company it's a subsidiary of a large company and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		whoops i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		we have three different that's my call's waiting they'll just have to call back uh we have uh
 		uh we're part of a
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		company in  we have a company in California and a company in Canada and this company here and uh so we have about five hundred employees at each place
 	
 	
 		they do
 	
 	
 		uh so it's that's about fifteen hundred all together then we but we're a a subsidiary of a of a larger company so we have all the benefits that all the big large companies have
 		i don't know any that we don't have
 	
 	
 		i don't know a lot about benefits most of the jobs that i've had you know were
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't have a degree i quit college when i first got pregnant with my little boy
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i plan on going back  just i want to wait for my kids to grow up now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh i'm sorry  so all i've had was mainly fast food jobs and i worked at a toy store and i worked at TI for a while but it was for Manpower so
 	
 	
 		that's all right
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i liked working at TI
 	
 	
 		i worked for TI for seventeen years and then i moved to Florida and worked at Martin Marietta in Orlando for four years and then i got
 	
 	
 		oh you're in Florida
 	
 	
 		i was no i'm in Texas uh i left Martin Marietta for this company here in Fort Worth it's i'm in Grapevine right now but
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i work in Fort Worth and they just offered me such a fantastic deal i i just couldn't turn it down there wasn't any way i could turn it down they
 		they moved me and they paid for every i mean they paid for everything my license my driver's license my all my utilities at my home plus you know paying to move my furniture and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my license tags everything i just you know and plus a huge salary increase and i thought God i'd be stupid if i don't take this and i wanted to come back to Texas anyway so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		and like i say they have all those same benefits that Martin Marietta and TI had so um
 		i've
 	
 	
 		what did you say you did again a computer a data
 	
 	
 		i'm a data manager
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it
 	
 	
 		well i took data processing in college
 	
 	
 		oh did no this is a lot of people think that it has something to do with computers and it really doesn't i mean i do have a computer but it it really doesn't have anything to do with computers it's
 		data that uh is generated like reports test reports financial reports all kinds of reports that
 		that uh a project would generate uh now it's my job to see that
 		contractually contractually these people you know deliver them on time and i have to make sure that they they do get delivered and that's that's what my job is and it's that's that kind of data instead of
 	
 	
 		instead of computer data well that sounds great though what did you do at TI
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		i was a a configuration manager at at TI which was
 		similar well it was uh similar but wasn't i mean i it was uh
 		doing uh it was a little bit more technical configuration management management it's a little bit more technical than what i'm doing now
 		and i liked it but it was a
 		it was a job that i always felt like i didn't have control of you know what i mean i never felt like i'd mastered that job and when i moved to Florida i moved down there as a configuration manager
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and stayed there from uh stayed at that job for quite a while until i
 		got an opportunity to go into data management which i and i've been in that ever since and love it i mean that's just my cup of tea the configuration manager was
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh i hate to feel out of control of anything
 	
 	
 		oh i do too and i really did i'd sit there and you know when people asked me what i did i never could really tell them what i did because i didn't know because i you know  i was doing the job
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you played it by ear
 	
 	
 		and i was getting good raises and my boss even goes you even got non periodic raises but i really just felt so control out of control
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so but anyway i'm
 		and i like i say i've always been with a company that's had a lot of benefits so uh and and when you get older now i know when you're younger my daughter just doesn't realize it but
 		i wish i had when i was younger thought about retirement but you know you think oh that's twenty years away from now who's going to worry about it well i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well me and my husband are we've talked about it we're having six dollars a day taken out of his check for retirement
 	
 	
 		that's good that's smart i wish i could talk my daughter into realizing that she works at TI also
 	
 	
 		well that's
 	
 	
 		and she needs yeah
 	
 	
 		at the TI in Sherman or
 	
 	
 		no she works at the Expressway site uh SC Building
 	
 	
 		okay well uh
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh
 	
 	
 		um that's about the only thing we're doing for retirement now when i worked i wanted to go to TI i was wanting to become a TIer that way i could get some benefits because most the jobs around here you can't get benefits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		i know isn't that a shame
 	
 	
 		especially if you well if you don't have a
 		degree or something
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i'll go back to school one of these days and i will get me a
 	
 	
 		see well i was uh
 		forty five before i got my degree i uh started back when i was it took me nine years i was about thirty something before i even went back to school or even started college
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i was forty five when i finally graduated
 	
 	
 		well i was eighteen and i went and got my GED i quit the high school i just couldn't stand it and then course i hated it two years after i quit i wish i'd never done it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but then i i went and got my GED and i went to school and then i i loved college i was making a three point oh average i wasn't having hardly any problems except for with my computer class i did have problems there but uh
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now i was then i was old enough to know you know well i'm paying for it i've got to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know do something with it but then i wanted to stay home with the babies so
 	
 	
 		yeah i stayed home with my kid i think i guess the longest i ever stayed home was eight years i stayed home with my kids and uh my son went ahead and graduated from college and my daughter has quite a few hours but she
 		bless her she and her husband are you know kind of struggling he's a policeman
 		they're both having and she works a second job too so she really doesn't have time i guess if she wanted to make time she could but and eventually i think she'll go back when it really means something to her but right now that's not foremost and her she likes being with her little girl
 	
 	
 		well we're having a hard time right now too but it's just who if the kid if kids don't have direction if their mother ain't home directing them through the day kids are growing up wild nowadays
 	
 	
 		oh i know it i know it
 	
 	
 		my mom had to work and i i can feel the difference um a lot of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well my husband had somebody to push him his mother was able to stay home with him more and you know he got his life straight at an early age which i'm not a i never i never went wild or anything but
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i still don't know what i want to be when i grow up and i'm twenty seven years old
 	
 	
 		i know it that's me i here am i in my fifties and i still don't know what i want to do but my my mother didn't work she was always home so and it  didn't i guess really looking back
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		knowing that she was always there when we got home from school my mother was there and now what i did when my kids were growing up since i had to work i worked nights i was home i was sleepy but i was home when they got home from school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's what's important isn't it you have to while i'm when they start going to school now my baby's just three months old and i'm not having any more so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm going to be there for them at least until they're in the second well until the baby starts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		school
 	
 	
 		preschool uh kindergarten not preschool
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which it don't take long it seems like just yesterday that my little boy was born and he's fixing to go to school next year
 	
 	
 		oh is he
 	
 	
 		yeah they're all growing up
 	
 	
 		your your husband works for the railroad you say
 	
 	
 		yeah he sure does

 	
 	
 		oh now do do they have pretty good benefits there besides uh
 	
 	
 		yeah their medical and dental is real good and uh like i said they do make it easy for you to that's where a lot of our money is going is toward his retirement but i want we'll like that once you know we get older
 	
 	
 		is it
 		sure oh yeah absolutely
 	
 	
 		and we'll need it and like i said that's six dollars a day and oh i haven't really sat down and figured it out but i guess it'd be pretty easy three times six is what eighteen
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's a hundred and eighty a month
 	
 	
 		oh once i did
 		well yeah that'll add up fast fast fast absolutely yeah you're smart in doing that i would never quit that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no well it's it's like this we don't see it so we don't really miss it
 	
 	
 		well i've started uh
 		that's right that i went the other day and had them start taking some money out of my uh
 		savings my checking at work to in to put into savings account plus i buy a two hundred dollar a month a bond a month so they'll and they'll stack up faster than you realize
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah now i wish they had that bond here i know that they had that at TI for the TI
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
