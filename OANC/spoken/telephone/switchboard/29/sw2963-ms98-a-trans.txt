 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you y'all do you get together with family reunions or
 	
 	
 		yes we try to uh we have not in some years now and i think we are going to try to have one this summer
 	
 	
 		oh that will be fun if you haven't done it in a while
 	
 	
 		my aunt is planning it
 	
 	
 		oh where is your family from
 	
 	
 		uh Missouri
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		southwest part of Missouri
 	
 	
 		so you are going to have to go there
 	
 	
 		that will will be where it is uh if if she gets it planned i have been out of town so i do not know what she has been doing but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they are all getting very very old all my aunts and uncles so we need to see them soon
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		my family is from Kentucky most of them is down there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i have got an uncle in Louisiana and another sister here in Texas
 	
 	
 		right do you all get together often or
 	
 	
 		we did when i was growing up it was every summer we got together now my grandmother just passed away this last year so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know she was the
 	
 	
 		i think as we get older it is difficult more difficult to uh
 		when all my aunts and uncles are in their eighties now so it is uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i have to uh i will probably have to take charge and do it one of these uh one of these
 		days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well it
 	
 	
 		i still have elderly parents alive so uh it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date you know that
 	
 	
 		it sure does
 	
 	
 		and if they are
 	
 	
 		well we in Kentucky it wasn't hard because everybody lives so close together we just did it word by mouth you know by word of mouth
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know
 		my uncle in Louisiana he is the only one that
 		you know had to travel
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and now i have got a sister in Germany and
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		we are just scattered all over the place so it is going to be hard this time but we have got a huge family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so the
 		yeah and we need to have more and more of them i hope i think i hope that is not a lost art that people getting together as they do spread out all over the world
 	
 	
 		yeah because it is so fun i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we my mother has got like thirteen brothers and sisters
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		yeah she has got a huge family and every one of them have five or six kids and most of them you know have got kids
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure that makes a big crowd
 	
 	
 		yeah it we just we had two baseball bleachers full of people and there are still about eight or six eight or ten people taking pictures
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		is that
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yes and it was just the last time we had one it was so fun
 	
 	
 		that is wonderful i hope
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well we need to have another one i hope my aunt is successful as uh later well it is probably not going to be done because i have not heard from them i it was supposed to be this June so i don't imagine there is anything coming this is hardly almost June
 	
 	
 		yeah well i
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		we have always had ours in a park or something but it has away been the same park and there is nothing really special there only thing is it is big and it is open
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's
 		we have it usually at this uh at this one park because there is a pavilion there in case it rains and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh you have to have it uh fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh in Missouri
 	
 	
 		in Missouri yeah it is too muggy it is not it is just uh very humid and the old people cannot take it anymore
 	
 	
 		well that was part of the problem with
 		well that was part of the problem with the ones we have now the kids would sneak off and we were just being kids and we found what we thought was just an old water hole so we was going swimming
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and like i said we was just stupid kids we was like eight and ten years old
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and our parents came and caught us we had been  playing in the  sump it was
 		part of the sewage cleaning system
 	
 	
 		
 
 		isn't that great
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Kyle don't  i have got a four year old
 	
 	
 		yeah well that keeps you busy yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah but if we could have gotten it by a lake or something i thought that would have been much better
 	
 	
 		yeah it would have been something for the young people to to do but
 	
 	
 		yeah well they there was uh i am sorry there was uh i remember now there was like uh a baby pool just  about a foot deep
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yes i remember my little brother riding a bicycle through it we were all kids anyway
 		
  
 	
 	
 		every family has all that going on i am sure
 		so
 	
 	
 		oh but i love it all the different foods because that yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i do too that is the best part of it
 	
 	
 		that's the yeah
 	
 	
 		everybody bringing something for a potluck picnic and
 		oh grand yeah
 	
 	
 		so how long did you say it has been since you all had one
 	
 	
 		i do not know i think it has been uh four three or four years or five even uh since they have had it tried to get everybody together they are just spread out so much and
 		and we really need to uh no matter how what kind of crowd they get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i hope
 	
 	
 		well i have been married almost five
 		so i guess it has been seven years since we have had one and since then we've lost
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh well just our grandmother that is surprising
 	
 	
 		yeah well time flies so fast it may have been that that long since we have one it is hard to remember but i think it has been about four or five years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		anyway i i hope both our families get to have one soon
 	
 	
 		oh if i can ever get down to Kentucky it has been like four years since i have been home
 	
 	
 		yeah it is difficult with little ones i know when we had had our
 	
 	
 		yeah that is the reason that is the reason i don't i would get on a bus any day by myself but i won't do it with the babies
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because uh i have got uh a four month old and a four year old
 	
 	
 		sure
 		oh Lord
 	
 	
 		so i am just starting
 		and i just quit too
 	
 	
 		oh i am telling you
 		that's uh
 	
 	
 		uh i won't be adding any more to the family reunion
 	
 	
 		no i hope
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it i know it takes a lot of effort right with with that with two little ones like that
 	
 	
 		yeah they are good kids though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i am not too upset
 		anyways i've enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		enjoyed talking to you good luck in everything
 	
 	
 		all right all right you too bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
