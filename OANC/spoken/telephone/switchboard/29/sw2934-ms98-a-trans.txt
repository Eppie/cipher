 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay how's the weather been out there
 	
 	
 		well the last three days it's been pretty rainy we went to the beach and uh it started uh let's see around four o'clock
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it had thunder and lightning it was and then you know it was just overcast and rainy for uh the next two two or three days straight how about yours
 	
 	
 		it's been pretty normal for this year you know uh they have tornadoes about once a week and it rains about every three days the last two years before they've had record rainfall
 		by this time of the year they'd had enough rainfall for the whole year but this time we're only um i think maybe five inches ahead of of uh normal so it's not been bad at all
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you're from Virginia
 	
 	
 		i'm from Texas
 	
 	
 		oh from Texas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i heard they had some flooding down there
 	
 	
 		um they had some flooding in Houston the other day real real bad over i think it was over the weekend
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hum
 	
 	
 		the radar just looked nasty with a bunch of red splotches all across it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well the last couple of years we're um we're over as far as our rainfall goes before that it was really dry and uh everybody was you know talking about rationing water and doing this and doing that
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		not really rationing water but just cutting down and uh it seems like uh you know the weather pattern is just shifting and uh that uh jet stream is moving uh into our area North Carolina
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's right
 	
 	
 		and across but it's uh changing latitude
 	
 	
 		there you
 		um-hum so you get a lot more rain that way
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		brings in that cold air and mixes it with the with the warm air coming off the Atlantic Ocean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's what
 	
 	
 		it's finally cleared up it's just now still still a little overcast but the sun but the sun has finally started popping out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		is the temperature like sixty sixty to eighties there too or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well right now as a matter of fact i'm fixing to go play tennis it's um i'd say it's at least seventy nine eighty well about seventy eight seventy nine degrees
 	
 	
 		um do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean or
 	
 	
 		um actually the uh the wind normally blows let's see let me think about this south southwest
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah uh but actually but actually our i guess our weather pattern comes from the uh
 		blows north east yeah you're right it blows north east
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's the way it does here most of the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh sometimes it just comes straight from the north and then it and then it doesn't veer off to the east until you get down to Houston or or uh maybe mid mid Texas depends on how strong the cold fronts are
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		how far how far are you from Houston
 	
 	
 		um well uh Richardson's a suburb of Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh i see so you so you don't have you don't get anything off the Gulf uh immediately from from the ocean
 	
 	
 		hardly ever unless there's a hurricane or something like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well uh it's kind of early for for i was going to say the weather man on on uh one of our stations was
 		talking about the way that the weather's doing now is like tropical weather and he was afraid if it kept doing that that they'd have early hurricanes early hurricanes this year
 	
 	
 		hm well we've had some you know pretty pretty rough winds oh uh Bangladesh Bangladesh boy they they caught it bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		kind of wiped them out
 	
 	
 		but we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes i know uh Hurricane Hugo you probably heard about that uh last year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		wiped everything out
 	
 	
 		yeah and they're still uh  rebuilding from that storm
 		so the the beaches here just get really beat up uh
 		and it usually comes this way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it comes up from uh Miami uh down around or you know around the Bahamas and it usually travels uh northwest
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits
 	
 	
 		do you do you get many tornadoes this time of year or
 	
 	
 		um let's see two years ago we had one as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house and uh it was real odd the um barometric pressure drops during a tornado and our uh fire alarm went off
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so of course that woke everybody up and we knew what was going on to uh you know go downstairs or go into the bedroom bathroom and uh take cover but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we get uh yeah we're we're uh we get our share of tornadoes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and uh the uh
 		uh you you aren't in the mountains or anything like that are you there's just hills there's just hills
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh we're about two hours from the beach so uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it's uh barometric pressure i believe is higher in the mountains and we catch we catch some winds you know a few winds coming off of them i think but uh let's see y'all just had a tornado
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh over close to Oklahoma and Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah they they had a lot of them they had a a huge one that was on um Inside Edition the other night in uh the southern part of Kansas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um they took a bunch of film of it it it uh
 		kind of chased them it was a few hundred yards away and it chased them under an underpass and it was tossing around the car right before it got there and it tore up the people inside the car
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		oh did it
 	
 	
 		and the the camera man on the news crew held the camera out they were hiding underneath the underpass and he held the camera out as the tornado went by
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and you the the wind you know it had a mike on it and the wind and everything was incredible
 	
 	
 		um boy i would have like to have heard that that could would have been something
 	
 	
 		i i'm surprised they didn't they because we saw it on the news a couple of days in a row and that and you know and that was way up in Kansas but over here it's a lot it's a big thing about tornados and people that get pictures of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh i used to live in Amarillo originally so i'm
 	
 	
 		yeah you can really see them well there yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  we used to sit out uh especially in Borger we use to sit out on our back uh picnic table
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh
 	
 	
 		and watch them come out of the sky through the funnel clouds and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground but otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's really strange the way it does that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		especially the wa y it starts it starts you know just like a little swirl in the clouds and
 		and uh then it just grows from there
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and it and and usually it's not even raining when it starts it's just
 	
 	
 		yeah you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was but the clouds are just really uh uh rolling kind of just real pillowy i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right and they're black and sometimes they're even green colored
 	
 	
 		oh well i was in that uh big tornado went through Wichita Falls
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the sky i mean we were right in the middle of it when i mean signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a whole roof of a restaurant came off  and uh it was a eerie uh a real eerie blue green color
 	
 	
 		gosh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the lightning was almost continuous just uh you know as if you put your hand on one of those electric uh things that causes lightning uh i think it was called the storm
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		yeah that's it
 	
 	
 		but um the sky the whole sky was full of that eerie blue green uh lightning
 	
 	
 		wow
 		and that's about that's what we get this time of year just all the way sometimes all the way through June the last especially the last two years it's rained
 		um what i think it rained nine inches in in one one of the Junes the last two years and this year usually we usually get about five inches in May and it's it's over that so
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 		we haven't got that much rain but uh when it rains it's it's been down pouring
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		all right well i hope you have good weather the rest of the summer
 	
 	
 		you too
 	
 	
 		have fun playing tennis
 	
 	
 		okay thanks bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
