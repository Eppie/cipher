 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay Pat can you tell me uh
 		what actually they want what everyday occurrences are
 	
 	
 		define everyday occurrences
 	
 	
 		right or do you have
 	
 	
 		every time you use a credit card every time you log in to a computer terminal particularly where you have access to a network to a network
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anybody can with the right kind of skill and tools
 		get very much involved in those things which are on your system that you don't particularly want exposed that's why we have such security measures for our corporate information
 		yeah if you absolutely
 	
 	
 		that's a point um
 		um actually um
 		uh using credit cards the information that the person that you give it to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		has of uh  available to them is very limited that's to just your name i guess um you don't have to tell where you live
 		you don't have to put your phone number down
 		some people uh ask you for it but you're not required to give that information
 	
 	
 		that's right when was the last time that you used a credit card that they didn't ask for your driver's license as well
 	
 	
 		oh very very few up here yeah yeah they just don't they don't ask for a driver's license um
 	
 	
 		really um
 		well most of our checks are even printed with our address our social even our driver's license numbers are printed on there
 	
 	
 		yeah see my
 	
 	
 		because they require that
 	
 	
 		yeah my checks are it's just my wife
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and my name no address
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it's just names on the check so no one can you know i mean they can i suppose with a little leg work if they wanted to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but the average person's not going to do that anyhow
 	
 	
 		right but we're talking about people who are interested in invading your privacy people who have a reason to do that
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		people who are interested in building data bases of information about your financial background your educational background
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh one of the biggest fraud scams that i've heard of recently is people who have access to such information and they find out who's a widow and what she's worth and then they present themselves to her as a uh a rich suitor
 	
 	
 		oh okay that's yeah i
 	
 	
 		and bilk her out of anything that she has those are
 	
 	
 		i've read articles about that but people have to be pretty gullible um either that or or especially widows um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		there are very vulnerable people though older people are very vulnerable to such things and they tend to to
 	
 	
 		old people
 		right
 		right and and some people some of the older people today uh their husband's handled all the finances so now they find themselves left out in the cold and they're really really not savvy as far as it comes to finances to handling their own personal affairs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh
 		well on the other hand how can you be savvy with so much out there today there are so many clever scams
 		and and many of them are computer based and they're based on information that's available
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in the public realm
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm still not convinced that
 		they can get you if you're if you're aware first of all you never should give your your uh credit card numbers over the phone to anyone
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		which is which is kind of basic
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		they people may generate lists are if you subscribe to a magazine i guess they sell lists of names to other people but they'll send you junk mail usually
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		that's right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um and you can stop that easy enough just go to the post office and just have your name taken off
 	
 	
 		um-hum did you have you registered for a conference recently
 	
 	
 		uh yes i have
 	
 	
 		okay did they ask for your fax number
 	
 	
 		no they did not
 	
 	
 		okay i registered my people for several conferences in the past six months and they'll ask for your telephone number and they'll also ask for a fax number you would think on the surface that that is for
 		rapidly sending you confirmation of your registration or your hotel or something like that not at all those fax phone number lists are being sold in exactly the same way your street address numbers are sold and you now get solicitations brought over your fax
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you don't expect it from that source therefore you're not as uh
 	
 	
 		yeah but that's uh
 	
 	
 		you know you're not as leery
 	
 	
 		isn't doesn't corporate have a didn't they put a stop on that
 	
 	
 		uh some some cases
 		but that it it exists is what i'm saying those avenues exist
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		yes they do exist and if someone wants to really find out about you i suppose if they wanted to go to all that trouble they could
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i heard a story not long ago this guy saw a really attractive young woman and he said hey i'd like to know this girl more so he wrote down her license plate number
 		and he called a friend in motor vehicles and got her address and her telephone number and then he called a friend that he had in the credit bureau and he got her financial standing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay
 		from that he also got her social security number and certain social security information is
 		uh a matter of is it is accessible if you know somebody in the government so before it was over with he knew that she was divorced she had two children what school they went to what her average income was he knew that she'd gotten a boat in the divorce because he was able to get those public records
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		he knew all about her
 	
 	
 		yeah you could do that if you really wanted to
 	
 	
 		and he introduced yeah he introduced himself to her he said i think our kids went to school together at such and such school she i don't really remember that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i mean you know he was relying on her not remembering or
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		or not being willing to admit that she didn't remember him and just moved right in on her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		that's and you can do that anyone can do anything that's public record whether it's divorce or anything like that um whether you purchase a home that's all that's all public record
 	
 	
 		sure
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum that's right
 	
 	
 		um what they do with that information people are really
 		um go out and do it i suppose somebody does the leg work and they generate a list
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh it's uh  i think lists are generated from lists now
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's true i'm still getting lists from many many years ago
 	
 	
 		and
 		right
 	
 	
 		or getting junk mail from a list that had to have been made years ago
 	
 	
 		yeah we had uh we've got a an account at Sears Roebuck
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we had moved from one town to another town and they've got our address listed now with with double towns in it and i've trie d and tried and tried to get it off but you just can't get it so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		since then we've gotten solicitations from other people listing both towns so i know damn well that Sears has sold their list of names out to somebody else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		of course
 	
 	
 		but there isn't anything you can do about that
 	
 	
 		no you can't stop them from selling your lists although some of them really are honorable organizations and they will say if you prefer us not to put your name on a mailing list then we will not
 	
 	
 		right some of the some of the charities now will will do that if you chose choose not to have your your name
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		put on a list and i i do that you know we have our charities that we give to and then we say yes no just don't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because you do it and then you're on everybody's charity list
 	
 	
 		um-hum and you have to really do some research or you do not find out who is legitimate and who is not and sometimes finding out who is legitimate and who is not is more difficult than finding out public information about people
 	
 	
 		that's right that's exactly right uh most of the funds that a lot of these organizations collect
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		go to fund the organization i mean very very
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		little of the funds get out to do uh anything worthwhile
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		um
 		it all started with the government
 		the government started keeping tabs on you and whether they
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		those list that Internal Revenue has whether they leak out to the public or not i'm really not sure maybe in some cases they have in the past
 		uh once a list is out it's out forever
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you bet you bet and with computer technology now look how spooky it is for how accessible these things are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but the bulk of it probably
 		ninety seven to ninety eight percent of all those lists are going just for solicitations um some people maybe are using them for ulterior motives i'm not really sure
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but the bulk of them is and it's junk mail and you can you can you can get off those junk mail lists you just tell the post office
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that will limit that amount of stuff
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i read uh i read and article where this this man
 		uh sent sent to everything they could possibly get and he was getting
 		reams and reams of paper all kinds of periodicals and magazines and letters and notifications and what he was doing with them he was storing them up and he was using them for fuel
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		way to go neat
 	
 	
 		
 
 		during the winter time
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		what i do is on all the credit card solicitations
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if they have a return envelope with it i write across the face of it no thank you your rates are too high and i mail it back to them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because now they have to pay the postage so now it's costing them something to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't put as many of those prepaid envelopes in there anymore
 	
 	
 		they don't
 	
 	
 		not as many as i've seen in the past
 	
 	
 		oh up here they do well they're still doing it well it's just like up here we don't there's very very few times i've had to show my driver's license for to use a credit card
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and i'm not sure why
 		you know why it's so prevalent down there and
 		maybe it will catch up up here
 	
 	
 		um that's possible i really don't understand that either but my stars some of it sometimes it's very difficult now the gasoline credit cards require your license plate number as opposed to your drivers license
 	
 	
 		yeah we've got the
 	
 	
 		although some of them have a blank on there for it they don't generally enforce using it
 	
 	
 		we've got the ones you just stick your card in the pump
 	
 	
 		um i've not seen one of those
 	
 	
 		yeah so whatever you whatever brand that you buy you just drive up to the pump you put your credit card in it and then it says you know please commence pumping and then when you pump then when you're through
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you put the nozzle back and it says do you want a receipt and if you can push yes if you want one and if you don't want one you push no
