 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		where are you from Tina
 	
 	
 		um i'm from Maryland and um i have one son who's
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		months almost sixteen months old are are you married or
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh i have i have two children i have a seven year old and a three year old
 	
 	
 		you are
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh so i try to spend as much time as possible with them
 	
 	
 		that's good uh what kind of things do you do
 	
 	
 		well um
 		we
 		we do a lot of things with them you know Taylor Taylor my youngest is or my oldest is in school and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		how was it a big change in your life to uh  have a child
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um yeah it's really nice uh my husband uh um is is working most you know most of the time he's working long hours but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm staying home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i'm just working a couple days a month and um
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh what do you do during those those days
 	
 	
 		um we we spend a lot of time at the playground and we go to the zoo and we go and we watch
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well you said you said you worked a couple days a month though what do what do you do
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i'm a nurse
 	
 	
 		oh are you
 	
 	
 		so yeah so it's it's it's real easy to work out my schedule you know to uh get in to to still
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		stay in with that an and to have enough time to spend with Matthew he
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he's uh just now really starting to to get interested in a lot of things  so um
 	
 	
 		yeah i understand that yeah
 		they really grow up quick especially at that early age
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but my my wife was uh she worked part time when my oldest was was little and now she's staying home all the time but uh that worked out really well because it's a big transition i think to have children
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know to go from you know nothing you know if you want to do something every night that's fine but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore so
 	
 	
 		that's right and i think a lot of people are um are turning to
 		well i think i think a lot of people are realizing that but still there are so many people that are you know have their careers first and it's uh i think it's really hurting the
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah i agree with you i
 	
 	
 		the kids you know but
 	
 	
 		i i think that
 		my wife leaned that way and i'm really glad she did and you know i'm glad she's staying home but you know i know there are some days when she wishes she wishes she was back at work
 	
 	
 		i know
 		that's why i like to  to work to work a couple days i think it's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it gives me a break
 	
 	
 		yeah well see that's that's why i'm glad my wife did too because she worked either two to three three days a week and that got her out of the house and yet she'd get to spend you know
 		three or four days with yeah yeah and so
 	
 	
 		most of the time at home yeah
 		uh we had started out like that and um i think that was
 		really ideal uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i do to i agree but then when you start having two of them it's you know a little bit tougher
 	
 	
 		it's
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because you've got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		it's difficult but
 	
 	
 		are are you from the Maryland area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i'm i've i've lived here forever so
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm in i live in Germantown and uh are you where are you from
 	
 	
 		um uh i'm in Dallas Texas
 	
 	
 		in Dallas oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so uh i'm i've lived here like eight years or so my wife's from Fort Worth
 	
 	
 		oh uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah i work for Texas Instruments
 	
 	
 		okay oh  so that explains  well um i don't know i uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that explains it doesn't it
 	
 	
 		we we do a lot of things on the weekends together the family but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but as far as during the week it's it's usually uh you know just my son and i and we're
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what's your husband do
 	
 	
 		uh he he works for Coca-Cola
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so he uh
 		he manages a plant out here an and it takes a lot of time
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah i'm sure it does
 	
 	
 		but um
 		it you know we take walks and  go to the library and try to fill our day with things like that but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah what uh my wife did some teaching at like uh
 		like a private tutoring place
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		a Sylvan Learning Center this year and so that that got me to spend to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because normally if if they need something they just go to mom
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no matter what it is i mean i could i'm perfectly capable of doing it for them but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's so much easier to go to mom i guess they get used to it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so but you know we'd go to the library and do things like that yeah but
 	
 	
 		that's good
 		that's good i know my husband was real uh in the beginning when he uh he was transferred to a a larger plant and he um
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		he works about an hour and a half away from here from our home and uh so it takes him a little bit of time and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not able to work during the week uh because of that he was i was working in the evening and he was coming home and i i could go to work but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		their relationship uh when i was able to work in the evenings uh really grew he you know just the time that they were spending together
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it it really it really helped to have that time together
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it really does because i think you you know you grow closer was your uh was your husband i mean naturally a child i mean had had he been around children
 	
 	
 		uh oh yeah he has uh he has seven other brothers and sisters and they have
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we have thirteen grand well his parents have thirteen grandchildren
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's uh
 		you know there's a lot of kids in the family and and he really enjoys it but uh right now it's kind of a difficult time but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and the cost of living here is just so tremendously you know outrageous  um
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's difficult uh to do it any other way
 	
 	
 		yeah i understand
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um you know it's it's hard because then
 		you're not getting to spend as much time with at home i mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so yeah that that's a tough situation but then then again you know some you got to do what you got to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know to get along too so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah at least i i just consider myself blessed that i can stay home  it uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well well like i said my wife normally feels that way there are days when uh i come home and she says here take these kids i'm getting out
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		so she's she's had about enough during those days
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		but but for the most part i you know i've really feel like that's led the way that you know what just like what you said with the cost of living and everything i think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and won't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so i think that's led tended to lead to a decline in in families and family values especially
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it has
 	
 	
 		and i really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that you know we need to do something about but i don't know what
 	
 	
 		i believe that too and i think uh
 		the kids are where they need to you know they need to really focus on the children in the world in this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		country
 	
 	
 		yeah would would you have said that a couple of years ago
 		do you think
 	
 	
 		no i didn't i didn't even really think about it that much i mean you know i knew i was aware vaguely aware of it but um i didn't it wasn't really that important to me and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child
 	
 	
 		oh it it really does i  just the whole uh
 		you know seeing how you really are creating are are forming this you know the mind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		well you know in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where you know he'll mimic something that you've done and you see you know everything i'm doing he's learning from
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and and you think if i wasn't here he'd be learning that from a babysitter or from a day care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they that's how they're developing their patterns and i think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it you know that's
 	
 	
 		or or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've seen a lot of people just say well you know he'll learn everything when he gets into
 	
 	
 		yeah eventually
 	
 	
 		uh you know
 	
 	
 		yeah it's true
 	
 	
 		but it um
 		i i know even just this first year that i've been with uh my son here here um he's i can just see how much
 		of of a difference it makes staying home with him instead of uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah plus plus i think it becomes part of you part of you too i mean you get to stay home i mean it's not just for him but it's also for you because you're both kind of bonding together there too i think so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well it's been nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		well it's nice talking to you too
 	
 	
 		okay good luck okay good bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye bye
