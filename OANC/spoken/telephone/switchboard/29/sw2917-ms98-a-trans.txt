 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		hi what do you do with your credit cards
 	
 	
 		oh  well my husband and i have gotten into some some problems with credit cards we don't handle them very well
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		they they're they're really bad for us um matter of fact we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa
 		then and we pretty much keep those maxed out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i was going to say that that sounds like like pretty many but i see what you meant you had them for each of the individual stores
 	
 	
 		yeah we had credit i had probably twenty credit cards
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um for i had i had an American Express American Express Gold an Optima all the different department stores um
 		two Visas two MasterCards
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		i mean i had any time anybody would
 		you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever i went i took it and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		um
 		because see the more the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um and the more you use them the more the more they send them to you
 	
 	
 		but each of these had an annual fee also right
 	
 	
 		exactly and the American Express was probably the worst the worst
 		um because the with the Gold card i can't remember how much it was because i didn't even have it very long before i gave it up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i know the Green card was like thirty five forty five dollars a year
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm forty five
 		right i  i
 	
 	
 		um
 		which was a lot because i mean you had to pay it in full every month
 	
 	
 		exactly you know i that's it i really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards so i sent back all of mine except the ones that were free
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um then then i also limited it to one of each
 		one MasterCard and one one Visa and here most of the stores will accept those and actually i then got a Discover card since they pay you back
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i had a Discover and that was one of the ones in the group that i ended up um closing
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		it really wasn't my choice though i mean i ended up having i ended up actually losing my credit cards um i ended up going through a credit counseling service
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um because my husband and i just don't handle credit very well
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and um when when you do that they automatically once you start with their service they close your accounts out
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		so i'm still paying on all these accounts but  my accounts are closed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so and i would prefer to keep it that way once we once we're paid off
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		i would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa and that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah actually i pay off my cards every month only once in my life have i not paid
 	
 	
 		i think that's a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well
 		how much do i have to pay these guys you know this month you know this you buy what you can afford i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right and
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um it's a lot easier to keep it in check
 	
 	
 		well and also in a sense they're giving you a loan for a month so that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if i were smarter i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which i don't do but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but yeah the
 		the thought of adding you know X percent to to the price of what i buy i just i can't accept
 	
 	
 		yeah and i and i think at this at this point in time with the economy the way it is
 		um
 		i think that um it's going to get even worse
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		i'm i'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off off now
 		um
 		you know we started we started i mean we started this last year
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i think this they way the whole economy's is going right now it's just not good to be in debt
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		yeah yeah that i would that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was you know juggling payments to different people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess because i never experienced it and it's not because you know i'm rich or anything it's just uh a mental concept that i have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that i just
 	
 	
 		well when when it's you when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set
 		i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul and i and i it was scary because i was so good at it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i thought this this is not right i mean this has got to stop because eventually it'd end up catching up at and catching up with me and it hit me in the face
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but it sounds like you know you you learned from it and you're coming out of it all right
 	
 	
 		i yeah i have i've learned a lot from it um i've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and my husband's too because he's he's the same way i am
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't think that
 		well when we when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		until the bill comes in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and all then all of a sudden you look at the bill and you go oh my gosh i spent this much
 	
 	
 		um-hum but now the fact that you still have two cards are you do you use them more judiciously
 	
 	
 		yeah we pretty much use them for for emergency type things like um
 		transmission fell out on our car
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		and that paid for a new transmission
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um and and things like that um
 		and we try we try not to use them for you know
 	
 	
 		purchases
 	
 	
 		inc idental type things like you know gas and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		clothing sales sales i find are a pain
 	
 	

 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i've i've gotten i've gotten a lot more away from from credit cards and i i pay by check a lot more now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well it sounds good you know like i said it sounds like you're you've really got it under control
 	
 	
 		i i admire you for for having that um
 		uh mind set for not not even getting you know past that thirty days i i would that's ideally the where where i would like to be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah and like i said once once it it happened i couldn't because my son's tuition came due and i guess i had you know not really counted on it quite
 		at that point but um yeah i didn't like it at all i was very uncomfortable  so you know and and i mean it was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i can imagine
 	
 	
 		i thought a lot sixty dollars interest or something for for just a couple of months and i'm going jeez that's outrageous  but in in you know retrospect it wasn't all that much i mean a lot of people pay a lot more and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know but still i mean i figured i didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you think about what you can buy for sixty dollars
 	
 	
 		exactly  groceries for a week  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i i think about all all the money that that we've spent on interest
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		on all of our credit cards and it's just incredible
 	
 	
 		but now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax
 	
 	
 		we've never been able to take it off our income tax i'm i'm fairly newly married i've only been married um less than two years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and before that
 		i never owned a home or anything so i never had any deductions
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so really it was always just money
 	
 	
 		thrown away yeah jeez
 	
 	
 		thrown away
 		and i never really thought about it because
 	
 	
 		you were good at it
 	
 	
 		yeah i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem
 	
 	
 		yeah i suspect that you know thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and you know the amount that i know they buy i guess probably a lot of them are
 		in a similar situation and you know just don't talk about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		most most people don't like to talk about money they feel uncomfortable i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know because i mean i guess for a lot of people it is very personal
 	
 	
 		very personal
 		um-hum
 		yeah and especially if you if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i i think the the average American is probably
 		pretty heavily in debt
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		not not including like a mortgage i mean a mortgage is an understandable debt
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um because that's you have you have to have a roof over your head
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i would much rather own my own home than than
 		be renting it like we're doing i mean we're basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we're renting a house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		but you know right now with the way our credit card situation is there's nobody in the world that's going to
 		give us a mortgage on a house
 	
 	
 		right right
 		but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's it's going to it's going to take quite a while um hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um i'm not really counting on it real soon
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum so that's that's been an even harder lesson then if it affected
 	
 	
 		yeah
