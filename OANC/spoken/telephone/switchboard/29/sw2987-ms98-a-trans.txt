 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you use your credit cards very often
 	
 	
 		um no not really we use gas cards more than anything
 	
 	
 		okay is that just out of habit or convenience
 	
 	
 		uh
 		basically convenience
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh which led to habit i guess
 	
 	
 		okay i don't use gasoline credit cards i used to have one
 		but i didn't use it uh i used it so seldom that i'd get letters from Mobil uh reminding me that i had a credit card to use
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah we don't we don't ever we don't carry a whole lot of cash with us so we use the the gas cards because our families are both out of
 		town and like when we travel and stuff we
 		use the gas cards
 	
 	
 		right so you basically use them as an alternative to carrying cash
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		and then we have a
 		an American Express that's through TI that
 		Steve uses just for TI stuff
 	
 	
 		are you uh solicited a lot uh for other uh credit cards
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes a lot
 	
 	
 		what
 		what uh criteria do you consider on whether or not you'll accept a particular card
 	
 	
 		uh probably the uh
 		uh if there's a premium each year and the uh
 		the APR
 	
 	
 		yeah i won't get a card if there's an annual fee
 	
 	
 		and there's it's it's kind of hard to beat TI
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so uh you know usually we just trash it just tear it up and trash it and
 		most most of the time it goes unopened
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i i think that Texan's is charging thirteen point nine percent uh interest
 	
 	
 		yeah if if that much
 		they're thirteen something but i'm not sure if it's i think it's a flat thirteen right now
 	
 	
 		it could be could be i don't uh use them often enough to even keep tabs on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but most of them charge between eighteen and twenty one percent per year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that's
 	
 	
 		and then you're then you're if you're that lucky you get to pay them another twenty five bucks a year just to be that privileged to get twenty one percent a year
 	
 	
 		right right
 		and i look for a grace period too so that they don't charge interest on from from the day of purchase
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and of course no annual fee
 	
 	
 		yeah that would that would help a lot i i'm not even sure why i mean the purpose of an annual fee i'm not really
 	
 	
 		well i i think it just generates revenue for the companies that uh for the banks that sponsor the credit cards
 	
 	
 		well i guess so because it's not any more prestigious to have to pay it
 		uh as far as getting another card where you don't i mean you know
 	
 	
 		no
 		uh i get uh applications for cards from oh different places for various reasons uh i got an application from Home Depot for their card
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh the incentive there was that they'd give you ten percent off on your first purchase with that credit card
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i got that card just so i could uh make a major purchase
 	
 	
 		have ten percent off but you got to use that credit card
 	
 	
 		right and get a discount on it
 	
 	
 		right yeah that
 	
 	
 		i did did the same thing with uh Foley's they uh
 		uh had a fifteen percent discount on a purchase if you just apply for a card
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right i did that with my husband uh he was off working at TI in Austin one day and so i went out to the mall to kind of look around and hit Mervyn's
 		and found some stuff stuff after Christmas on sale and ended up getting fifteen percent off already off of it already whatever it was lower and i think that's the only card i have that's
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know recently is gotten a Mervyn's card and i used it for i think for the first time when i was in Houston this weekend and i have i've had it for months
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i always maintain a zero balance uh i don't like owing anybody anything
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i don't i don't like it a whole lot either
 	
 	
 		if you want to borrow money there're better ways to do it uh i think you can get a loan through the credit union for about uh oh i don't know nine or ten percent now i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh keeping a credit cards uh charged up is just uh
 		not a very good way to uh to make to make use of borrowing money
 	
 	
 		yeah i never understood how people could i mean there are some people who say well i can't charge it it's at it's limit and i thought God how can you charge a credit card to its limit
 		it just it just i guess it's that that you know lack of discipline when you have a piece of plastic that says pay later you know
 	
 	
 		yeah it's the buy now pay later plan and uh live for today
 	
 	
 		yeah and i just it's that
 		yeah it just borrow worry about it tomorrow
 	
 	
 		nobody bothers saving any money
 	
 	
 		yeah and it just i don't i don't really go for them and i in fact i had my own before we got married and ended up cutting them up just for the fact that TI had lower rates
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you know and decided and i mean when i tried to close with Chase Manhattan it was just like pulling teeth
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i couldn't close they'd send me a statement every little this is your new
 		you know balance with bonus points or whatever you know and it's like look i closed this months ago and i don't want any more of your letters i don't want anything and well you have a credit balance well send me a check  you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		yeah well there's a
 		a basic problem too with not using credit cards that they are good credit references
 		when i closed on my house mortgage uh the mortgage company was looking for uh references credit references and i didn't have any credit cards charged up at all i keep the balance paid off so they make lousy credit reference then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah they do but we we were in in that same boat a couple of years ago and they had said well
 		just list your major ones and and the balance still owed on it you know or give it a balance still owed on it and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's all we did
 	
 	
 		when the balance is zero it doesn't help much
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i get a lot of uh pre approved applications from various organizations and i throw all those out
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's like well who are you to approve  something for me without my permission anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i think um i think what you can do as far as
 		i don't think as many companies
 		when you are a good customer i don't think they report that as much as they should their delinquent customers
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because a lot of times you have to write a nd ask them to report it to the credit bureau so that you look like you have good credit
 		as far as you know paying off you know your cards early or on time or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that usually doesn't happen unless i've heard people say well you have to write to ask that and i say well you know if someone's so quick to turn you over because you're thirty days late
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think they should they should do do that more often
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you're right
 		uh
 	
 	
 		what do you think about that uh Discover card
 	
 	
 		i
 		well uh  funny thing about the Discover card is i just pulled a uh one dollar check from them out of my briefcase today that expired uh last month i didn't cash it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh they they sent me a dollar uh refund from last year's purchase i i used it one time
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh i got a dollar credit a dollar check but i didn't uh cash the check and the check expired but on my last statement i noticed that they credited my account with a dollar credit
 	
 	
 		the dollar you didn't cash
 	
 	
 		could very well be
 	
 	
 		oh oh well i was wondering how that that worked because it's like you know we'll pay you for and i'm going wait a minute
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i've got so many uh well i don't have a lot of cards but i've got a lot that i never used
 		uh i stick basically with uh the Texan's MasterCard
 		and uh very seldom use the American Express card
 	
 	
 		yeah we don't we wouldn't even have one if it wasn't for TI and Steve traveling we just
 	
 	
 		sure corporate card
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i would never pay thirty five dollars or more a year for uh use of a card
 	
 	
 		no
 		and uh
 		we basically just have the we you know we cut up a lot of cards when we you know like it's just as easy just to use two you know instead of paying so much
