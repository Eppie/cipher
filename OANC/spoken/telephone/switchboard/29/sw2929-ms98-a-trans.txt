 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you want to go first
 	
 	
 		well i believe that the um the voice that uh initialized this call asked about uh if we thought that it should be something that
 		should be put into action
 	
 	
 		yeah like the government if should the government make it universal or something like that
 	
 	
 		yes i i i i would be committed to that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh you you would be in favor of it
 	
 	
 		because
 		oh definitely yes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i know that there are many countries that um
 		are very successful with the operation of the government uh providing that plan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do they have options on who they
 		uh you know like choices of doctors and that type of thing
 		do you
 	
 	
 		um i'm not sure what how their program is run but i know it has been successful
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i would really have to uh read the history of
 		probably i uh the country that has faired very well with it i'd like to see the uh
 		the data on that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's the way with me i don't know a whole lot about it i would that's the only concern i would have because i think personalities
 		plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care
 		and if you didn't have any choice
 		on you know on who you go to
 	
 	
 		well i
 		yes i think that's primary is if you have a good relationship
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		anything with him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		or to change even like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely that the choice would be yours
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um given the proper guidelines for your health
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that you should be able to make um a choice there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that that's one of my main concerns i i have a friend that has
 		their boy has been sick for several months and they just have found out what's the trouble and they have gone through
 		uh one two three four five doctors and then a team of doctors
 		and they finally determined what the problem was it took that long
 	
 	
 		yes and the expense of that yes
 	
 	
 		and that that something like that you know i thought if you couldn't change or
 		look elsewhere
 		you know for help
 		if you want i don't know how that program works you know if you can do that
 	
 	
 		well i would i would think that they would have that as part part of the benefit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to the health care program that you would indeed have a choice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that you could select that individual yourself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor
 		and hopefully that they would have their um
 		accreditations there too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i guess that's that's primarily was one of my thoughts you know because you know how government is
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yes um
 		but those guidelines have to be set up and i think they should be voted on by the public
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		for them to have a choice on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if they're in favor of it or not
 	
 	
 		right yes
 		and of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be and
 	
 	
 		it it would
 	
 	
 		um
 		i think that's
 		primary uh for the health if they were going to have a universal health care plan
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that uh they would have all the facts and the figures and uh
 		what it would mean to each individual family and uh and individual
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		perhaps being single
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		um i'm not sure what else that uh
 		we could address uh on health care
 		um
 		other than the fact i think um
 		the eyes and the ears and the uh whole self should be uh
 		uh included in all of that uh dental eye care and uh  our body as a whole should be included in that because
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there are so many avenues that needs to be um
 		undertaken in a program like that
 		um
 		i wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for
 		anything and not be covered by the program
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i know where my son works they have uh an option
 		right now where they can have their own physician or they can choose one that their company
 		has elected
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that costs them less
 		if they take the doctor that the
 		that the company has selected
 	
 	
 		and does he have an option uh if he doesn't care for the personality
 	
 	
 		he get
 		well only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		otherwise he would you know he has to take the physician that uh and the hospital that the company has chosen as their
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know the one they have taken
 		and their again i mean he's gotten good service he took the less expensive one of course
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well if he's pleased with it i guess that's uh the bottom line
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so but i i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah cause there's always that opposite story there
 	
 	
 		uh because that's the first i've really
 		known anybody that you know works for somebody that they had that option
 		you know to make the choice of what kind of insurance policy they what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it's quite different from when i was uh
 		under doctor's care that's for sure
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm very thankful that i'm not under any doctor's care
 	
 	
 		oh  if you have your health you're wealthy you really are yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh we live in a rural area up here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what part of uh Pennsylvania do you live in
 	
 	
 		uh are you familiar with any of the area at all
 	
 	
 		well i have a brother that lives there
 	
 	
 		where
 	
 	
 		uh near uh Philadelphia
 	
 	
 		oh well that's that's a ways away but we live in Clarion County
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh we have a cousin that lives in Philadelphia
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		are you a native Pennsylvanian
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay so
 		i'm a former Michiganian so
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh that's a nice state
 	
 	
 		yes it is it's very lovely it's a very lovely state
 	
 	
 		so i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in you know like more populated areas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh i'm sure it is uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as far as uh
 		the doctors that are available
 		of course we have good physicians here too we've been pretty fortunate
 		we've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area
 		for some of the different fields
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh we've been pretty fortunate um-hum
 	
 	
 		that has broadened so much also
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that is the fields that you know are opening up are
 		um just phenomenal they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean look at the AIDS uh case you know i mean they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's a whole new
 		field in itself it's just
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		in itself it's just it's an auto immune deficiency but it sure is a dilly one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it sure is i still wish they could do more with the cancer situation though
 	
 	
 		yes i do too
 	
 	
 		they uh they just don't seem to be i know they're making progress but not like
 		that i would like to see yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		to eradicate it entirely yeah
 		well there's guidelines that people have to follow and if they're determined to uh have their cigarettes and the other uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		carcinogenic causing items then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how do you teach them i guess you would
 	
 	
 		but a majority a lot of them don't do these things even and it doesn't seem to matter
 	
 	
 		that's true too it's i i i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it
 	
 	
 		so uh it real
 		uh-huh
 		well they say second hand smoke and that is worse than smoking  so so what do you do you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well you just have to ban the smoking to their to their little room that they want to
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah take their rights away from them they say  i never had the desire so i haven't ever had that problem
 		as far as that goes
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i can't take any credit for not smoking either
 		so
 	
 	
 		well it's a bad habit that's
 	
 	
 		it's hard to break it's a hard one to quit
 	
 	
 		that
 		yes it's they say that it is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well it was nice talking with you
 	
 	
 		yes very nice talking to you too and you have a good day
 	
 	
 		and
 		well you do the same and uh we'll be talking i guess talking around the country
 	
 	
 		right  okay
 	
 	
 		okay you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		um bye bye
