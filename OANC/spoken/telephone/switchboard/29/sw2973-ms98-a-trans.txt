 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well where what what's good in Washington DC to eat
 	
 	
 		well i think we're very fortunate because um in the past twenty years Washington has really developed a a good number of quality restaurants um
 		mostly although you have your normal continental we've gotten the excellent excellent ethnic restaurants um we have Ethiopian restaurants we have Latin American restaurants
 		um you know besides the normal range of French and Italian and things like that so uh we try to experience
 		because i am Italian background and my husband is Chinese we really try to uh experience quite a bit of difference in cooking styles
 	
 	
 		well you have a lot to thank your husband for noodles
 	
 	
 		oh God yeah  but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i live in a great place i live in Berkeley California in what they call the gourmet ghetto it's uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's it's it's got every well it's it's a very uh polyglot community you know got every every kind of ethnic background you can think of but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just up the street is one of one of one of only two five star restaurants on the east coast less than a block i mean on the West Coast i think there's only like four in the US but
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		well what
 		uh-huh is it continental
 	
 	
 		uh well no it's French actually
 	
 	
 		it it is French uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it she uh yeah yeah the the name of it is Chez Penny you may have heard of it but they uh they they  they specialize in flower salads actually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and i'm sure it's quite i'm sure it's quite pricey
 	
 	
 		and they got you know
 		well actually it's like thirty five dollars for the meal and that's you know and each night is a different that that there's never the same meal twice
 	
 	
 		oh
 		so it's a price fixed and you go in for the menu that they have
 	
 	
 		they
 		yeah and you go in you know and of course it's booked for months on end
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but they also have a um a uh i understand a buffet or something that you know people can just walk in
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know combination this is like during the day
 	
 	
 		what kind of food do you like
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		any specific any specific time
 	
 	
 		oh no no no i'm one of those people that as long as it's good it really doesn't matter
 	
 	
 		and and you're adventuresome
 	
 	
 		oh extremely yeah i was one of those kids that would go into a menu go into a restaurant when i was a kid and and and would not order unless i had never had it before
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well we're very fortunate we have we have two sons and ever since they were even even very little they we very adventuresome i mean they tried frogs legs an and they tried rabbit and all sorts of things so uh
 		we've never had to have the problem of picky eaters
 	
 	
 		well it's oh i was a i was a picky eater when i was real young but then i got to the point where i discovered that you know
 	
 	
 		and
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there was something other than than Twinkies in the world
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well they they've been they've been adventuresome since they were i mean even preschoolers they'll they tried anything
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah so um  it's been fun it's been great and uh of course in the area of Maryland where we are of course crabs are one of our big delicacies
 	
 	
 		oh i know i know i i used to live back in North Carolina and i remember going to up to to Richmond James River and we'd get  and and flounder you don't we don't get flounder out here on the West Coast
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		oh i know but you get some other kinds of fish that are just wonderful i know that you have abalone out there
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		and fresh i there's nothing to rely i mean fresh abalone is wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is a lot of work but it's it's good really is
 	
 	
 		yes yes but uh you know Baltimore also is a wonderful eating city
 	
 	
 		uh yeah Baltimore Baltimore i saw a movie about Baltimore recently Abalon that's right
 	
 	
 		i'm
 		okay okay and Baltimore's got some great dining areas it's got little  ethnic communities
 		little pockets of ethnicity in the city and it's absolutely marvelous the  it's sort of one of these underrated cities and they're some great restaurants there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um it there are mostly um besides the little ethnic things you've got your great seafood places and there's one great German restaurant there called Hausners
 		the owners of which um traveled all over the world and this place is room after room of art so that you feel you're in a museum except it's completely over done
 		and it's it's a real place to bring people for something to talk about and it's a very German restaurant they've got the whole gamut of German dishes
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so uh when we go out i guess we look as you said you like to try when you were young something different we try to go out for either two things something to make it a festive occasion
 		and to try something very unusual  or else we go back to a few of our uh for Chinese restaurants we usually follow the chef
 		if we know the chef's in a restaurant and what their specialties are so there are certain Chinese restaurants this is something i learned from my husband where you only eat certain things
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and uh other things that they don't produce in you know in quality but other aspect other Chinese restaurants you would eat other things so uh
 		we we do tend to eat out at least once a week sometimes more although with two sons in college now that may be it may be a little less
 	
 	
 		yes well  uh uh of of course without two two sons it's it's it's also easier to go out isn't it i mean
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		really you know i mean
 	
 	
 		it certainly is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh what's what's your major consideration when you go out to dinner
 	
 	
 		well uh basically it it's it's it's it's good food and and uh price comes into it some you know not not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah which would so it's fun to find good food for a reasonable price too
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's what's really great about where i live here it's in in an area that's within you know four or five blocks there must be forty restaurants i'm not kidding it's just uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's
 		oh well how tempting
 	
 	
 		it's in you know it's just just down from the from um University of California Berkeley and uh and it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that that's what's good about it is that the the the the prices are extremely reasonable and the competition is so keen that the food really is good so you know you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		we have to we have to drive  any restaurant where we're not in walking area of any even a store so we do have to drive but within you know within a um
 		fifteen twenty minute drive we have a whole span of of restaurants that we can chose from and unless you go into downtown Washington and the elegant areas
 		uh even the some of the areas in Washington you can get very reasonable and very tasty meals and uh
 	
 	
 		one one more time what was the name of that restaurant in Baltimore the German
 	
 	
 		Hausners
 	
 	
 		Hausners i'll
 	
 	
 		Hausners H A U S N E R S um-hum
 	
 	
 		have to remember that well Linda it's been a pleasure talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah if you ever get out there
 		well i enjoyed talking with you too all right bye-bye
 	
 	
 		all right you have a good one bye-bye
