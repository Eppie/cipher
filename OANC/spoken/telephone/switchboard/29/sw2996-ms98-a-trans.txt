 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i always think i'm paying too much taxes how about you
 	
 	
 		yeah oh definitely  seems like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there'll be a day that they're going to uh enact this i think uh
 		the um other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling so they keep trying to say we may need a uh state income tax
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that uh we probably will have to have to uh have a state income tax because uh Texans don't approve of such things as lotteries
 		uh uh well i i come i come here from New York and New York had a state lottery and it really raised a lot of money for the for the state
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh although we in New York we had to pay a state and a city uh tax and it was really a great relief when i got to Texas that i didn't have to pay that city income tax though
 	
 	
 		yeah makes quite a bit of difference in your uh well your income level you know because other states take chunk quite a bit a chunk out for uh city and state taxes so you're uh looking at your yearly salary it makes quite a difference
 	
 	
 		right
 		it sure does make make a difference
 	
 	
 		a little more take home here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you live in Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah Richardson area
 	
 	
 		oh you do oh
 	
 	
 		yeah i work at uh well mainly the Expressway Site is where i work
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 		and then you know too that uh taxes are are less like if you live in Mesquite
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there uh
 	
 	
 		or up to Collin County somewhere that you're getting out of the um Dallas County area because what do we pay like eight and a half percent something like that for the uh sales tax
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		eight point five
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which yeah that really is pretty high
 	
 	
 		is it the same is it uh less in Collin County than it is in Dallas County
 	
 	
 		i think so although i really i don't go up there too much i mean i i normally just kind of go to Richardson Square Mall or Valley View Mall just kind of for the convenience uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess maybe if i was going to buy a car or something maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know save a little bit on that sales tax because on a car that really matters kind of mounts up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah it sure did and then once you could deduct at least some of that um off off your income tax and you can't do that anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it really hit me yesterday i had uh air conditioning service for my car done and i had a little little uh coupon special that was twenty two dollars for um air conditioning service where they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh checked it and charged recharged it and put one one pound of freon in and if you needed another pound of freon they gave it it was like seven dollars and something
 		and then with the with the twenty two dollars and the seven something it all came out to i i ended up paying like thirty four dollars and i couldn't believe it and it the tax you know really hits you
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's true although i wish i wish you know overall they'd try the lottery again when did you first come to Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum and then
 		oh it's been i've been here for nine years
 	
 	
 		okay well that's about the same time as me i came down in eighty two
 	
 	
 		really where'd you come from
 	
 	
 		um well Ohio kind of my parents live in Ohio i had lived a little while in Michigan but you know basically i went to high school and college in Ohio and lived there uh more years than i ever did in Michigan
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well uh i did visit uh Michigan i visited Kalamazoo once my sister used to live there
 	
 	
 		oh okay but you know when we first came down here i really thought this place was somewhat backward i mean i was just shocked that we couldn't shop on Sunday
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's true i tell you what hit me the first year i was here uh Christmas eve in New York there used to be stores open the department stores wouldn't close uh
 	
 	
 		remember that
 	
 	
 		well i'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock the department stores on Christmas eve but uh there were stores that you could go to uh you know like discount stores and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to and you could shop till like twelve or one o'clock that night and that was like that was really the only night they were open that late but it was Christmas eve and when i came to Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i thought i was going to do that Christmas eve and i couldn't find hardly anything open  after five o'clock in the afternoon and i was oh i was i really i really was stuck
 	
 	
 		
 
 		were you shocked like oh no i'm stuck i need to buy stuff
 	
 	
 		and i think Target was the one that stayed open later than anybody anybody else and uh i was able to pick up a few things in there but boy i was i was really shocked
 		and then another shock i had  well when i went to uh to buy a slice of pizza and found out that i had to buy the whole pie
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh few places now seem to do it by the slice but
 	
 	
 		yeah now but they but back then they didn't when i first came no
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		well the the uh there was other things too i mean i think it's taken us Yankee's influence down here to get them to uh come to the the the you know the correct decade here and century um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer or alcohol whatever in the car
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i mean you could always um uh be careful about that back then because uh you know if you if a cop stopped you then you would um you know get arrested or whatnot and people would just drink openly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		it yeah and talk a talking about alcohol and beer look at the taxes on that and the taxes on a package of of cigarettes i used to smoke you know and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that would have been enough to to make me me give them up the price of them now but i gave them up couple a couple years ago because i had some sinus problems
 	
 	
 		oh well i don't smoke so i don't really know what the taxes are and stuff on it
 	
 	
 		well
 		well they're like two
 		or i i believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		maybe a little bit a little bit a little bit more in some places
 	
 	
 		so you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes
 	
 	
 		uh well i believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton i think it's maybe thirteen or something
 	
 	
 		huh
 		gee
 	
 	
 		uh because i remember we went to to Oklahoma to this this bingo place this Choctaw bingo uh a couple weeks ago and somebody that went with me bought a carton
 		for uh uh ten dollars and something and they really thought they were getting a big discount
 	
 	
 		they're cheaper there
 	
 	
 		well because it's you know the Indians i don't think they pay tax
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in in Oklahoma
 	
 	
 		oh i got you okay
 	
 	
 		and uh it was a Indian
 		it well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there although i didn't see very many Indian people in there  there were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth  i won a dollar  yeah i had fun uh couple people on the bus won some money one one guy won two
 	
 	
 		well how'd you do
 		a dollar oh well but you had fun playing right
