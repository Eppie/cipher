 
     		
 	
 		well i think we pay too much in taxes  how about you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think they waste what we pay
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		i think they waste what what all the money that we pay
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i think too i don't know how you feel um we moved here from another state we've lived here before went out and came back and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and what you find out is there's one evil's the same as the other here you don't there's no occupational tax but it's a heavy sales tax so they get you coming and going
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no it's even it's even higher in Dallas County so was it
 	
 	
 		yeah its really i know it's just um
 	
 	
 		eight and a quarter i think
 	
 	
 		yeah it is i was shocked i went we bought a new washer and the man said and that's eight percent i said eight percent what so it's really kind of sad yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then i don't know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal but it just seems like if you're strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is that what you think
 	
 	
 		yeah because it different at some point it goes up to thirty three percent and then the people that make you know five hundred thousand dollars and and and higher than that they don't have to pay sometimes they have to pay even less taxes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		doesn't seem quite fair does it because they have the money to shelter things and i don't know somehow get a huh
 	
 	
 		no it isn't
 		what
 	
 	
 		oh i thought you were going to say something they somehow seem to get around the the things that we can't you know that make don't make that kind of money
 	
 	
 		no
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		i mean if they're in business and and they're making money i i could see if they're losing money but they're making money then they should pay taxes then
 	
 	
 		um-hum i know and just somehow it doesn't seem you know and and they're not you mean you look at somebody like uh that country singer uh what's his name Willie Nelson
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i was reading about him in the paper and i said well you know he knew he was making money somebody he didn't look that stupid why didn't he pay his taxes you know
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		in a way it's almost like he had so much debt that uh filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		do you file federal or a joint income tax or do you
 	
 	
 		i just file federal income tax every year
 	
 	
 		and do you feel like you get hit by you know too much
 	
 	
 		yeah i just got divorced so i'm single again so and you know it's it's it's a lot worse for single people because they pay the same amount as as the people that make the same amount of money and they're married that
 	
 	
 		um-hum and we right now we don't own any property we lease so we're in the same we don't have children so we're in the same kind of it's not as bad as being single and divorced but it's sort of like if you have like X point five children and own you know
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you kind of get hit with you know i i mean it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage because and that sounds stupid but i mean there's actually less tax implication if i don't work full time compared to what my husband does you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of hard
 	
 	
 		whoever works less they get a tax credit for that
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		if both of the both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right yeah otherwise you're just you know and if you have kids you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something
 	
 	
 		well it's two thousand now yeah for everybody
 	
 	
 		oh it is oh oh my well that's not too bad
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		then you get a you get a child care exemption but it's not enough you know i mean you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care and and they only give you like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well i think it's about five or ten percent of that you know it doesn't even it's not even
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 		yeah i guess that's my call i guess i better go
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		okay well it was nice talking to you uh-huh bye-bye
 	
 	
 		nice talking to you bye-bye
