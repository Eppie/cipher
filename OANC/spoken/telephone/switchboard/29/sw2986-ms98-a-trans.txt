 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well crime's not very bad out there
 	
 	
 		no as a matter of fact i understand we have one of the lowest crime rates in the area but then we aren't we're only a city of five thousand
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		how's Richardson doing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's been a lot worse this year
 		um
 		they have a lot of drug dealers over on you know where Spring Valley is and Coit
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's real bad there has been for a few years especially on the Dallas side
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		Dallas is just across the street and
 		and uh they've closed down a bunch of apartment complexes and uh
 		you know
 		like that and they're having to crime sweep
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i wonder why it effects certain areas
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because i i i've lived in the Dallas area perhaps for about uh thirteen years now and i used to live in that not in that particular area but on that side of of Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that was always a a fairly good area in there if i remember correctly
 	
 	
 		yeah it used to be
 	
 	
 		but um i guess it moves in different uh areas at different times um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the only problem that we have here are are you know just very minute sort of crime we have neighborhood crime watch programs and then the uh city police patrol the areas at least one a day
 		and when you're not at home you're to notify your neighbors of course that you know you're going out of time et cetera et cetera and not do the things that are so obvious to uh potential
 	
 	
 		right get someone to pick up your papers and your mail
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		set your lights on timers and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 		other than that that's about the only thing we're doing in Sachse
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the murder rate really seems to be up in Fort Worth and Dallas well especially Dallas last year in Fort Worth this year
 	
 	
 		i think i saw on TV just this evening that there was a pregnant woman and and some members of her family killed was that over in Fort Worth
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah this morning uh-huh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and apparently they already they already caught him or they're talking about somebody else they're talking about two million dollar bond for somebody
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah i never i never heard all of the story about that i just heard it from people at work and on the radio uh a little bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's really been
 		
 
 		Fort Worth has really been bad because of the kidnappings and all the armed robberies
 	
 	
 		i wonder why over there i mean i'm glad it's not over here if you have to have it but um i don't understand why certain
 	
 	
 		i i think i think that um they're just getting well they had that crazy person that  kidnapped the
 		the woman and took her all they way to Saint Louis before they were caught you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she called the FBI
 	
 	
 		was it over in that area last year that they had the man um that was in the mall and this other man shot his wife
 		in in the mall area she and she was screaming and heading towards the entrance to the mall and they shot her
 		and then there was a man in the um parking lot and he pulled out a gun that he had in his car and he shot the the guy was that over in
 	
 	
 		oh i i think that was Redbird
 	
 	
 		oh oh that was Redbird
 	
 	
 		yeah it's real bad too
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		everywhere there's a mall there's bad crime though
 	
 	
 		as a matter of fact this summer early early  actually earlier this spring i had gone to Collin Creek mall and my hubcaps were stolen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the police officer told me that um
 		the the malls are a very good area where these people like to go and steal the hubcaps they just steal one side
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah exactly uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and take off
 	
 	
 		they stole the emblem off of one of mine
 	
 	
 		did they
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i don't know whether that's a faddish thing or what
 	
 	
 		apparently
 	
 	
 		and then it costs us so much to uh replace those things uh-huh yeah surely
 	
 	
 		from the insurance and yeah
 		they also they tear off the hood ornaments too and one of them costs thirty dollars so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		and your deductible of course doesn't mean that it's it's under that it's it's normally
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah  i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i really don't know what else to say
 		does that about cover it
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i mean and they said take what steps and we already discussed that you know you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh about the only thing you do is is to provide the um protection in your own home and then be careful when you do go out at night if you go out at night
 		and um certainly that's about the best thing we can do and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they have any laws against that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah i work at Valley View and they have horse patrols and um and they have the mall security that that drives around
 		probably around the mall at least once every ten minutes at night especially because they have so many stolen cars and they've had um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		three three armed robberies of uh jewelry stores
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh and they've all been in the middle of the day
 		you know
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh one of them was three hundred thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		that's quite a lot of money isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah really is
 	
 	
 		and it gives other i imagine other uh potential crime people uh ideas too
 	
 	
 		but i've seen they've stepped up security quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the police are around a lot more now so
 	
 	
 		i imagine they're going to need more police officers too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if they do that
 	
 	
 		then they use they use undercover too
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess that's true
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well even here in Sachse we have one undercover police car
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and actually if we
 		had to call him a few times and they're usually on the spot in about five minutes
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		course as i say we're a small town yeah
 	
 	
 		small town but still you know
 	
 	
 		yeah at least they're there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so well i've enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah it's nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay have a good evening bye-bye
 	
 	
 		you too bye-bye
