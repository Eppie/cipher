 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		are you a Vietnam veteran Dudley
 	
 	
 		uh no
 	
 	
 		no do you have family who were in the Vietnam War
 	
 	
 		uh no my father was uh came in right after world war two
 	
 	
 		okay so he was too old and you're too young right yeah all right do you know some folks who have been there
 	
 	
 		i am too young yeah
 		um yes a couple
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay how did it influence them
 	
 	
 		uh the the one guy i worked with down in Austin hated it uh he was a lineman down there and while he was there he caught some kind of a strange disease
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh all his hair fell out and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh what about long lasting effects on him has he still suffering from those problems
 	
 	
 		i do not think he was in combat so
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i've talked with a number of Vietnam veterans and i really i had no one directly related to me involved
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh my sister's husband was in Vietnam and it it really made a completely different man out of him he went to Vietnam one man and came back another not better
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		then uh another friend of mine went and he was in combat but he came back and he said okay that's it that is behind me i am going on with my life much like what Roger Staubach did
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		he was uh he was a Vietnam war veteran and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but he was in the Navy though he was it makes a lot of difference
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		right and but uh most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land or in combat are still still carry a lot of anger
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they really do and uh i i i i really do not think that we did those young men right i think that uh Desert Storm shows a lot of learning since that time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well the armed forces did so much to you know Agent Orange they did so much to their own people all during that time you know and they take they take a even now uh they take a free hand as far as medicine and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you know how they treat the war casualties you know if you come back and your leg's blown off you know or or it is hanging by a thread they still can't put it back together now but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but what they do afterwards and how they rehabilitate rehabilitate you
 	
 	
 		well you know one of the most troublesome things that i have
 		encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country since that conflict uh not so much that i say i do not want you here but there is just such a surge
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of southeast Asians it has affected the culture of this country uh very much
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		it's about it's about nine or ten percent now
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah well uh the culture's changing look how much more oriental food we have restaurants now for example
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		even ten years ago
 		there weren't that many a lot of shops are are operated by uh southeast Asians
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a lot of people have complained in the schools there is a culture change there the southeast Asians seem to be very hungry there seem to be very studious
 		and uh tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them which is not bad not really uh but it might in the long run you can see where
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		scholarships for example uh even jobs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh jobs that would normally go to an American with a lesser education
 		might be going to to some of these people here and that is all a result of of of Vietnam and and you see a lot of a lot of men that were over there brought families back
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		uh and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there and i'd be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well they are probably not doing very well at all because i know there's there's still people even in the Dallas area there are there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from uh Vietnam
 	
 	
 		i know that they're
 		you are talking about POW's or missing in actions
 	
 	
 		um uh native native Vietnamese people
 	
 	
 		native Vietnamese people okay
 	
 	
 		yeah they were lost you know when they were little and and they could never did get back
 	
 	
 		oh i hadn't that that hadn't occurred to me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that'd be an interesting concept
 	
 	
 		and uh and uh that's is really a big waste because they didn't they didn't win they didn't regain any of the land that they had it spilled over into uh now i can't even think of the country but
 	
 	
 		Cambodia
 	
 	
 		yeah Cambodia  and to Laos and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and all they did is run and hide and they weren't really fighting you know it it would've been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but and i am not even sure who was involved more whether it was China or Russia you know they were pouring they were pouring weapons in there and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and advising well digging tunnels for them you know and there is no way that they could ever catch them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i think the terrain had a lot to do with the the success of Desert Storm as opposed to that in Vietnam
 	
 	
 		yeah that is right
 	
 	
 		you know there is incredible cover in Vietnam and you can't find much cover on  in a sand dune
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah and all they can do is dig in and they you know and then they try to camouflage the top
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		well now even i think even now in in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job
 		because they could  they could kill all those plants you know which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on but and the and the Corps of Engineers i think do a better job now like they did in Desert Storm
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		because they had he he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went and they had to you know they had to blow them up or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or disarm them and then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he where he'd made those moats
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		what war do you think they found the experience for that
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		don't you think they learned from the mistakes in Vietnam
 	
 	
 		well yeah partially uh-huh yeah part of it is technology yeah because all go ahead
 	
 	
 		part of it's that part of it's technology but
 		but when when
 		when you get into trouble like that in a place like Vietnam you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into and you sa y never more and and you overcome those problems and you are prepared next time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think that's one of the reasons that they've they've pretty much avoided getting involved in South America because
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		look what happened when they were looking for Noriega and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him you know he probably just went down into a tunnel
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 		sure sure sure
 		well i know that  from a personal standpoint people
 		was one of the finest assets that we lost we didn't actually physically lose them they did not lose their lives but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had
 	
 	
 		yeah that is right
 	
 	
 		uh being entirely different people i had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's a long time to suffer
 	
 	
 		yeah and they they really need everybody that's that's stood there it's when in in Vietnam i think it was much closer contact you stand there with a rifle and blow a a piece of somebody apart
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or blow their head off and that has to affect you if you are human you know so they had to work all that that anger out and the and the nightmares that come along with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah yeah i can't uh
 		oh yeah you bet you bet
 	
 	
 		i don't i do not really think that anybody can ever forget forget that but they can they can reason and and try to adjust to to why they were there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well you see that's what the veterans are so angry about now they say well we're going to listen to this and we're going to look at this find out what our mistakes were and we're not gonna make them again but that doesn't undo the ones that were done and that's what makes the veterans angry
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i can't blame them i don't know a solution
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i sure can't blame them for being angry on the other hand you know you can be angry about something for a very long time or you can say well that is the way it is and go on with your life
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		for the most part i wish that it hadn't happened but it did so
 	
 	
 		yeah and that and that was that was in the in the era when Kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything you know and and and they fought initially got into it because of Eisenhower
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and he just he didn't want to be in it any more than than what we started out in August with Desert Storm and then it just blew up into the war
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well it has been that way for a very very long time though i can remember when i was in the sixth grade and that was many years ago we were reading about the French struggling with that in southeast Asia
 	
 	
 		French yeah um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so and and and the Asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on there there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i really i don't know it we should not have maybe gotten involved but if we did we certainly should have supported our people who were there more so supported them when they got home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and i i saw the movie Born On The Fourth Of July and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah more than was apocalypse now
 	
 	
 		um-hum well Dudley have we pretty well discussed the subject well i think so i enjoyed talking to you uh-huh bye-bye
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so yes it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye
