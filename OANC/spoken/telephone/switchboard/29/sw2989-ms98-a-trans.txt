 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		Wayne i've uh feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available how do you feel about it
 	
 	
 		well yeah i feel much the same way i've uh two kids right now one is two and a half and one's nine months and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that age of course everything you do they're trying to learn to do and so uh it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn you know that that they need to learn at the age you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		reading and uh reading and playing nice with others and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah we went through this with our children and now with our grandchildren and i've always tried to do things with them uh
 		like when you're at the little league helping out even though i'm not a good athlete myself i was able to help the coach in in just controlling the kids if nothing else
 		and we've always uh oh tried to take our children and now now at this age our grandchildren
 		to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to i think that's just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so it's uh we have uh lived several places around the the US and we have where we've lived we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area
 		like when we lived in Tennessee we we took them to Washington DC to see all the capitol and and things like that when they were small
 		and that just uh it helps i think the children to when they're learning in school to say well i've been there and i've seen that
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so uh that's the type
 	
 	
 		yeah it certainly does because uh you know the things in the books seem so dead to the kids and you know unless they've actually been there or whatever because i remember our family
 		well we went we went everywhere and uh
 		uh seeing New England and uh being on Plymouth Rock and stuff like that was uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really made the whole thing more uh visual and you could uh read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need food we need to raise food quickly because this this place gets very cold very soon
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah we've uh
 		gone through that uh i remember my parents didn't do all those type things and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that and even now with my grandchildren i feel it's a very important thing to be done
 	
 	
 		right because if uh kids don't look up to you or or can't can't feel they can spend time with you they're going to find someone else and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid to emulating or whatever
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well i can remember one of the things i'm most proud of is uh when my son was i think it was in the sixth grade
 		they had to write uh a little brief autobiography of themselves and about what they had done and what they wanted to do and
 		i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to uh have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a real a real point of pride with me
 	
 	
 		yeah that is nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		excuse me we sound like we both have colds
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's um
 		well it's uh
 		uh ten o'clock here in Falls Church Virginia so that the only reason i'm home is because i'm home with a cold  and the wife says well you need something to do talk to the guy on the phone
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 		oh well you're kind
 		yeah well i'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of Dallas Texas so we're we're kind of far apart here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've uh this is a very interesting program i i've heard about here on this and when i signed up for it it uh looked like it could be uh make a real contribution in in participating and uh
 	
 	
 		right yeah i'm uh electrical engineer by trade
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh here in Virginia  likewise we uh
 		we do some projects every now and then we like to get support from uh other other companies as well so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a
 		failed savings and loan  so you know trying to work myself out of a job  but it's it's been an interesting uh roughly oh nine months here and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		again this is our home area we've lived here about seventeen years and it's uh
 		we enjoy living here it's where we originally started out and we've lived up north for a while in Chicago and over in Tennessee so wound up back about two hundred miles aware away from where we started out
 	
 	
 		yep
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well uh that's about all i can think to talk about right now it's been a pleasure talking with you
