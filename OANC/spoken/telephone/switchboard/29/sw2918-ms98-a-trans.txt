 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if you don't cook though what do you like to eat if you go to a dinner party
 	
 	
 		well uh i'm uh a bit of a seafood lover i suppose uh i have a health problem in that i my cholesterol is high
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i'm in the in the process of bringing that down so i don't eat a lot of beef or pork or almost none
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i would say most likely a dinner party would be you know would include some kind of fish seafood or you know or poultry type dish as the main course
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well uh i was just thinking as i was listening to this recording go over and over till they found a party for me to talk to  i could talk about a dinner party i had uh Sunday
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it included some seafood so that would probably be uh appropriate for you
 	
 	
 		well uh that sounds good
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i had uh some people from Germany visiting and they are uh fans of American shrimp
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i did a kind of a stir fry dish with shrimp that you shake up in a bag with a little parmesan cheese and flour and then uh quickly
 		uh fry up in a little olive oil and then uh take out of the wok put some uh red strips of red pepper and green pepper in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		stir that a little bit uh add some uh sliced mushrooms and then put the shrimp back in with a half a cup of white wine and just bring it to a simmer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you serve it on rice and it's really a a pretty low cholesterol dish
 	
 	
 		yes that sounds sounds really good uh
 	
 	
 		because its done with the uh shrimp and the olive oil you don't use any kind of beef fat or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		no no animal fats in it
 	
 	
 		right and that's
 	
 	
 		And it's very popular and it looks very pretty and uh with rice and a salad you've got a a meal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right that that really sounds good
 		uh i'm a a uh
 		frequent as frequent as possible traveler to the New Orleans area and so we eat a lot of seafood my wife and i eat a lot of seafood when we go down there
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh that's a good place to get it i miss it i lived in Houston for a long time and  we loved to go over to New Orleans to eat
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah uh
 		oh did you
 		
 
 		but uh we we have not been there uh since last summer but uh it's we're looking forward to going back as soon as as we can
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but we eat eat a lot of shrimp and uh eat oyster dishes and uh
 		we like uh things like uh the poor boy sandwiches with the fried oysters on them course i'm not supposed to eat fried oysters any more but that's uh we like that that and uh love gumbo
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i wish i had the recipe for my grandmother's gumbo she used to make the most wonderful crab meat gumbo with shrimp and all sorts of other goodies in it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		goodies in it My job was picking the crab
 	
 	
 		oh yeah so uh
 	
 	
 		not my favorite part
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh but i guess uh my like i said i'm not a cook so my wife probably does or does definitely do you know all of the cooking for you know when we have a dinner party uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i help with with what i can and uh you know we don't have uh
 		uh something on the order of what you had uh you know it don't main dish and probably some kind of a starch and a vegetable
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we eat a lot of rice and and uh the the bell peppers that you uh sauteed are just right up our alley we eat a lot of that a lot of mushrooms
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well the reason for using those is that it makes such a pretty colorful dish People always exclaim when you have the red and green peppers and if i'm making a whole lot uh i use a yellow pepper as well
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for one pound of shrimp i use one red pepper one green pepper and oh maybe half a dozen ten mushrooms medium sized mushrooms
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's plenty for four people and if they're light eaters you can squeeze in six
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah if you if you wanted to uh put a little crunchiness in that uh throw a few cashews in it
 	
 	
 		but
 		oh yeah that's good uh my husband is a Chinese cook he doesn't do much cooking either but he loves to cook Chinese and he has a marvelous uh chicken with cashews and
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh
 		right and uh
 		right the cashew chicken is is i i really enjoy that
 	
 	
 		and the Szechuan peppers now those are not the hot ones those are the little round pink ones
 	
 	
 		oh yeah just
 		right
 	
 	
 		and oh they are wonderful that uh he does that uh uh chicken with cashews and Szechuan peppers and he also not at the same meal
 		does a wonderful vegetable dish with Szechuan peppers but use that uses either asparagus or um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right yes
 	
 	
 		let's see what does he use asparagus is the one we like the best oh broccoli you can do the same dish with broccoli and also if you're really in a pinch you can do it with just celery
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah we uh we also uh uh cook on a do an occasional dish with uh some kind of a Mexican theme
 	
 	
 		and it's pretty good
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we you know have discovered that you can make you know just as good a Mexican food with uh
 		with chicken or with even with turkey we we do cook a lot with turkey and it you can come out with you know good spicy Mexican food
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh and make it chicken or or turkey or something like that instead of going with the beef like when we make fajitas we can make you know chicken fajitas and and enjoy them just as well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i like them too i think they're great uh we i've been trying to convince the cook at uh at the place where i work uh we are kind of isolated and so we don't go out to lunch very often
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		and we do have an excellent kitchen uh which is encouraging for people to stay around and uh eat and interact with one another at lunch we're a think tank
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's one of our functions is to  get people to talk to each other and she has started cooking uh much healthier food much much more uh salad without mayonnaise and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh much more
 		main dishes without oils and uh and vegetable i mean and uh animal fats
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i think we're improving our diets i don't know whether it's the California influence or whether it's everywhere but
 	
 	
 		well i think it's everywhere i i i know that uh
 		oh probably at least half of the people that i know are on some kind of a low fat diet for one reason or another or are low fat or no fat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well my husband's cholesterol is not real high but he his father had uh an early heart attack and so he is very conscious of his
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh physical condition and he walks a lot and tries to get uh to stay in pretty good shape and to watch out for high cholesterol and
 		since i prefer the kinds of foods that one eats on a moderately moderately low cholesterol diet anyway that suits me just fine
 	
 	
 		yeah we have found that uh since we've stopped eating so much beef and pork that when we do eat it it tends to upset our systems
 	
 	
 		um yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know it's uh my wife in particular when she uh she said you know when she eats uh some kind of a beef dish
 		if it's the the least bit spicy along with the beef itself that she really her you know her stomach really acts up so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we eat uh eat very little beef and uh we just
 	
 	
 		yeah we don't either we just eat it once in a great while and uh it's usually if we're having company and it's somebody that we know is a big meat  fan but there're fewer and fewer of those
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we also do an awful lot of cooking when it's just the two of us on a little tiny uh  grill it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh it's less than a foot long and about eight inches wide and we just put a few charcoals in there and uh we can cook a piece of chicken we buy boneless chicken breasts and save us ourselves a lot of time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		And that with uh do have you ever tried Lawrey's Lemon Pepper
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you can buy it in the grocery store
 	
 	
 		yeah i i don't know whether we've tried that or not i i know we've got a we've got a uh is that uh the salt
 	
 	
 		it's a
 		well it has sea salt in it
 	
 	
 		yes i think we've got a
 	
 	
 		but it's not the same as they have the Lawrey's seasoned salt and the Lawrey's seasoning Lemon Pepper and the Lemon Pepper's the one i love on chicken and fish
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah just
 		barely brush it with oil grill it uh so it's not too done and sprinkle a little of that on it and then i add some lemon thyme from my garden
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that makes an excellent and very easy to fix
 		dinner
 	
 	
 		yeah you know it's uh about fifteen minutes until noon here and we're talking about food and i'm
 	
 	
 		well i hope you have a nice lunch
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's been a it's this is a this is a good timely conversation you know got my appetite going
 	
 	
 		i'm just looking at our menu unfortunately we're having a terrible lunch here today for the cholesterol people because uh we're going to have Italian sausage and French fries
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think i may stick to the salad bar today
 	
 	
 		right yeah okay well it's been nice talking to you and uh or maybe we can have a good lunch and think about it while we're uh about our conversation while we're eating
 	
 	
 		nice to talk to you too
 		okay bye-bye
