 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		hi do do you have lots of credit cards
 	
 	
 		yeah we well we have quite a few but we don't really use them a lot we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards because we like to be able to stop you know when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station but as far as like MasterCard and Visa
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we don't use those too often
 		what about you
 	
 	
 		um i used to have a ton of gas credit cards and now i have one or two of them but i think i've even let some of them expire but i was living out of the country for a while so i wasn't using them too much and i don't drive that much but i have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know MasterCard and Visa and you know i have a MasterCard and an American Express now i got rid of the Visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen million cards but as long as like my
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		MasterCard is um free as long as you spend about i don't know three thousand dollars a year or something like that and so i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card when i have the choice
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff the stores around here don't let you do it too much
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and so i don't but i was living in France and there you pay for everything by credit card but it's not really a credit card
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh is it like an automatic debit or something oh huh
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a debit card yeah
 		and um just you know it's  many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash  bye thanks  um yeah because they're just so well set up with it
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah we use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase but we always have the money
 		set aside already to and then we just pay it off the next month we never pay we don't like to pay interest on the credit cards at all
 	
 	
 		right well
 		yeah i i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i occasionally do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know i'll forget to pay the bill by the due date or this last month i mailed the check to them on the twenty second and they didn't get it until the thirtieth and it was due the twenty fifth
 	
 	
 		gosh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah so i thought i and so i got hit up with a credit uh finance charge on it which pissed me off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because um
 		you know i really did mail it in time
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		they have no proof of that i don't i don't want to i'll probably talk to them some more discuss it but i i never um
 		usually never pay finance charges
 	
 	
 		yeah that yeah we we screwed up one time like that too we mailed it and they just never did get it and we had to finally mail them another check
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i had that hassle one time and
 		i that went on for months and months and months because and they eventually found the check and
 		deposited it and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that and i said well i mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so you know
 		i guess i don't know who the the burden of proof is on
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't either
 	
 	
 		you know it's kind of a
 		because you never do when i pay bills i don't make a Xerox copy of it or i don't
 	
 	
 		no you figure you'll get your check back if you have to
 	
 	
 		um
 		right or i don't get a i don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever i you know at the bank
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to have a proof of when i mailed it
 		and i mean you can't do that it'd be ridiculous
 	
 	
 		really i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i don't do real often or something from out of state you know where if something's wrong
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you don't want to end up having to pay for it a couple times i've had to write big credit card companies and say you know i didn't really get this or
 	
 	
 		well you can
 	
 	
 		i don't know what this is
 	
 	
 		right or i returned it so don't charge it yeah well that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer and the computer um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		didn't wasn't didn't do what
 		these people said it would do we need to just put external cards in and it wouldn't do that so he brought it back to them and they're supposed to modify it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i called the credit card company and said well we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us we can't use it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then they said well then don't pay it
 		and then a month later i had to dispute it in writing and i was out of the country and got back and i took care of it as soon as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay i mailed off a check but then it was too late so now they're hitting   with a finance charge
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but it's sort of you know it's it's half our fault
 	
 	
 		yeah since it well yeah if you filed that letter with them then they'll kind of
 	
 	
 		and so we
 		right if i had filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually it would have been okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i learned that for the next time
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i am like you too about the yearly fees i don't uh i don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card right now both the MasterCard and the Visa we don't have to pay a yearly fee on and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		is to us as long as we don't have to pay that yearly fee now we had American Express cards
 		and
 		my husband had always had that before we got married and those got so high we finally decided
 		for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something like that i can't remember but we decided let that one go and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well my husband and i both have that and i don't know what we pay for his card i pay i think i have a gold one so i think it's like seventy five dollars for me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm not quite sure what it is for him but i had really like
 		there
 		nowadays i'm not sure so sure that it's worth it but um in the past there you know there are some places that only take American Express
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then
 		they don't have the credit limit because i've over done the credit limit on the other card if my husband and i both travel
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if it you know a couple of plane tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card
 		and um
 		with the American Express they say there is no limit there really is but they tell y ou that but then that was one advantage but that's that's like
 		i don't i think it's seventy five dollars for me and forty for him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for a year which is a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		be
 	
 	
 		but yeah like you said if you really if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah well we should probably get another um Visa card yeah one another one that's free because there are some like i think AT&T has one that's free if you make two purchases a year
 	
 	
 		it's more worth it
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well so
 	
 	
 		yeah that wouldn't be too hard to do
 	
 	
 		yeah and so that's easy enough to do and if that's true that's um it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and get rid of the American Express because it costs so much
 	
 	
 		have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to be stuck with that we've never had that problem either
 	
 	
 		no
 		no
 		i and i don't understand i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it but i don't understand
 		yeah because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and sometimes it comes in right away and it's like oh well i guess i have to pay that too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because like many times i'll try i'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey i won't get that bill until the next bill not this bill and it will come in on the next one you have to pay for it right away anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but sometimes the  is long like i've had things that i didn't get billed on for two or three months
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something lot of places have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		those i guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute you charge it yeah
 	
 	
 		immediately yeah but that's what happened with us like we bought a washing machine seven months ago and then i got billed like the next day
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		it didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check but we prefer  like with the credit card you get the automatic um one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's nice
 	
 	
 		you can uh return it so like the washing machine
 		we bought it in October and
 		you know if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and somethings like that are
 	
 	
 		yeah i like that feature and the insurance like if you break it yourself even you know if you buy something that's breakable
 	
 	
 		right
 		or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so that's you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use but like if your baggage but things like if your baggage gets lost
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you get money for that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		to buy new bags and things like that
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		and yeah when you rent a car you get that and sometimes you get discounts with the cards and so
