 
     		
 	
 		okay well what are your hobbies
 	
 	
 		oh they range from
 		from needlepoint to
 		uh anything in the hobby field as far as um needlework is concerned
 		i've had to give it up recently because um i've got problems with uh nerves in my right hand but basically it's anything in that hobby line i'll try anything including making uh earrings
 	
 	
 		hum that sounds interesting
 	
 	
 		i have no love of yard work for hobby work though how about you
 	
 	
 		well uh my i've got some fairly bizarre but uh i do a lot of flying aerobatics for one
 	
 	
 		oh fantastic
 	
 	
 		which a lot of people don't do and uh woodworking i do i do enjoy doing landscaping some landscaping type stuff i build i like i enjoy working with wood and stuff like that building decks gazebos those types of things
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so but uh probably if i had to say my most favorite one was probably be uh flying
 	
 	
 		i've been in a uh
 		glider
 		which as a student piot pilot
 		i loved it immensely
 	
 	
 		did you oh you actually tried it before
 	
 	
 		as a student pilot yeah
 	
 	
 		as a student pilot
 		how long did you do it
 	
 	
 		uh i was only in one one trip
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it was something i would have liked to have kept up but we moved out of Colorado so that was you know that ended that point
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but yeah that i'll try as far as you could say hobby then i'll try anything that's unusual that i've never done once
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		just to find out what it's like the experience oh as
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but that's not a constant hobby you know like i'll do uh oh i'll pick up normally a petit point or anything in stitchery type of line
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and if i'm really bored i'll even pick up something and color it
 		but i do a lot of designing also
 	
 	
 		hum
 		well needlepoint looks pretty
 		i i think you know if it's done real nice real you know if it's done right it looks really good
 	
 	
 		well i've done a petit point which is really extremely hard
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh that was very difficult for me it took me oh i think that almost took me a year and a half to finish that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and petit point is like if you've seen
 		regular needlepoint it's one half of that in the stitches
 		and it goes down like real small little tiny it's exactly what it says petit point
 	
 	
 		
 
 		boy that's tedious
 	
 	
 		yes it was tedious i dropped it as i said it took me about a year and a half because it's not something i could continuously do
 		but now i'm into more uh taking something that i like and trying to actually put it onto paper myself
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		which i find more enjoyment that's got a lot of math to it at that point
 	
 	
 		what type of scenes do you do
 	
 	
 		uh this last one i'm trying to do a house there's a house here in Plano actually it's a real estate office
 		but it has
 		it's oh i would say it every section of this real estate office is a different type of a structure
 		it's oh i would say it every section of this real estate office is a different type of a structure it goes from almost um castle looking on one side to a very old fashioned look on the other side and it just varies in each little section of this real estate office
 		and i think they did it because of that purpose it is a real estate office
 		but it fascinates me the way they've done it and it's it looks good it's all done in brick the windows even vary on it
 		and that's it really fascinates me so i've sat across the street from it and i've tried to put it down on the paper now
 	
 	
 		hum
 		i've been over to Plano quite a few times my brother lives over there and i've yet to see anything like that over there
 	
 	
 		it's on um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		let's see fifteenth and uh Park
 	
 	
 		oh okay so it's it's on the other side
 	
 	
 		well i live right around here
 		but it's not if you drive by it you don't notice it
 		because it's all brick there's no difference in the front except you can see the little difference if you actually stop and take a look at it
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		that's why it fascinates me
 		but uh again you know i'd like to be able to go ahead and take that someday and actually make a house of my own
 	
 	
 		well that's pretty neat though i would i mean i wish i had that that much patience to sit down and do something tedious like that but
 		after a while it would just drive me nuts
 	
 	
 		well see you're doing the same thing when you're doing your gazebo you're playing with numbers
 		that's all this is you putting it on paper so you're just playing with numbers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's like i would love to play with work but i don't have the strength in my hands
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		anymore to do anything like that but i've put up uh
 		like um a wall board fixed a bedroom and put in a bath
 	
 	
 		i like things i like i like building furniture probably the best that that sort of thing
 		when i had the equipment and and the place to set it up
 		i like
 		things that are difficult to do i like to see if i can do it
 		back when when i was in college i took lots of wood courses and then i i even did it after i was out of college i continued to do it and i built just about every stick of furniture in my house
 		everything from dining furniture to armoire to the whole nine yards
 		takes a long long time to do all that stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a small miter box uh for hobby mitering
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it does the same thing what you're saying but i'd like to which i've been trying to find to go into as far as a permanent hobby which because i'm having difficulties with this is to go into uh i'm sure you've seen it is those wood
 		uh
 		oh they're they're wood pictures on the wall but if one move if one part moves it counterparts the other parts
 		and so like it's a continuous counterpart around it
 		and it's all made out of wood
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and i have as i said i have a miniature uh
 		miter box which is made for hobby works
 		and i've had that for quite a few years now but i haven't really gone into that part i've been thinking about making um
 		oh ladders and everything for my uh pocket parrot because they're hard to find toys for a pocket parrot they make them for parrots and they make them for cockatiels and a pocket parrot's between the two
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so i need rings that are exactly between those two sizes so i'm going to i've got some designs for i go into the pet stores but you can say again another hobby i've got is my birds so
 	
 	
 		birds
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		birds
 	
 	
 		i have a cockatiel and a pocket parrot
 	
 	
 		oh those are interesting
 	
 	
 		but um
 		other than that
 	
 	
 		see which ones talk do do the do they talk
 	
 	
 		uh Sam uh cockatiel talks he whistles at me and says good morning
 		uh he picked up most of his sayings from the other cockatiel i had the pocket parrot is a very quiet bird it's an extremely tame bird
 		it's uh if you're real gentle with it when you buy it it'll come out and sit on your shoulder with no problem
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		yeah they're a very very tender bird
 	
 	
 		about the only thing i had when i was growing up was probably a parakeet and canary
 		and uh we could let it out and fly around the house a little bit
 		and uh
 		oh you they wouldn't really you know didn't really want you to pick them up per se but you know when i did they didn't they didn't give me a lot of trouble
 	
 	
 		well see when i was oh about i guess about ten years ago fifteen years ago
 		i don't know if it's been that long i took my dog my cat and my bird into the vet at the same time
 		and he was just sitting there he goes Carol you're the only one i know of that does this and i go what's the problem because i never thought about it i had never thought one thing at all about it and of course the dog and the cat and the bird are all out of the cage
 	
 	
 		boy i bet that was interesting
 	
 	
 		and uh my my bird at that time was picking the feathers out from underneath his wing
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh he finally said well you ought to get it a mate but the bird turned around and bit him he was furious he was so mad at me but yeah he had a picture of my birds
 		sitting on top of the cage with one tail inside of a front of a cat's face and the tail of another cat walking underneath the cage
 		so he just loved it he just absolutely adored it
 	
 	
 		that's unbelievable i would never have thought that you know that they would leave you alone without trying to attack each other
 	
 	
 		well the one large cat that i still have uh he took claw marks and put it down my drapes going after the birds sitting out on a
 		bird rack that we set up outside for birds
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		going after the birds
 		and then he'd get down and jump back up on the table and sit next to a cage that had two cockatiels out on top of the cage i'd get so mad at that cat because i didn't realize what he was doing until i saw these big claw marks going down my
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		drapes from his back claws
 	
 	
 		yeah that nice nice expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah i didn't think i didn't appreciate it too much i mean it's rather i thought it was rather funny here's a bird doing this and two birds sitting right next to him but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean the birds were out they weren't in the cage they were out i never left them in so but i thought but i still have that cat in fact i have both cats which are my kids' cats but the birds are in here with the cats they don't care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they keep an eye on any cat that walks outside but they don't care about these cats
 	
 	
 		well they get used to each other
 	
 	
 		i don't know what it is i've seen
 	
 	
 		guess they know they have to live together so they may as well make the best of it
 	
 	
 		i've heard a lot of people that doesn't work that way
 		i mean i've seen that dog my son's dog open up it's mouth and absolutely put it totally around the cat's head
 		and the
