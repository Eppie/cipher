 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay  you want to get a start
 	
 	
 		certainly um the weather here is warm and it's been sort of raining on and off
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm an avid gardener so i measure measure measure the rain in our rain gauge on a on a regular basis so i can can avoid wasting money on watering
 	
 	
 		oh great great
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh but it's been threatening to rain for the last couple of days and it has not really which is a bit of a disappointment but it is very warm here which is typical for this part of the time of the year how about Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		yeah i think you're i think you're earlier than we are as a rule aren't you your your your summer growing summer starts a lot earlier than ours
 	
 	
 		it starts in uh March as a rule
 	
 	
 		uh-huh see that is quite a bit we are just beginning people are have got their gardens in a lot of them now we could still have a frost
 	
 	
 		really this late could you have snow
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh probably not but we have had we have had a frost as late as as in June
 	
 	
 		oh well we don't have that problem
 	
 	
 		early june  so but we we have also had nice weather an unusually uh nice spring it is almost like an early summer for us
 	
 	
 		oh well that is nice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we could use a little more rain
 		i believe
 	
 	
 		uh well we will be glad i will be glad to give you some of ours  usually we get it in in great quantities in April and May
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then it stops for three months
 	
 	
 		yeah if it could just be spread out a little bit uh-huh uh-huh yeah it's really been nice here uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we're supposed to have some rain this weekend but i don't know if we'll get it or not a lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us
 		the the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us just by  well not too many miles
 	
 	
 		um are you in an agricultural area
 	
 	
 		yes um-hum we have
 	
 	
 		well i know the weather i know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of off of the land
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah we have quite a few farmers we we live out in the country we're on a farm but we're not a farming person  uh we have a garden but uh but we're not farmers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		hum well you know there are some disadvantages to being down south and that is it gets so hot that you know a lot of things die during the summer from the heat
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh yeah they get burnt off
 	
 	
 		they they really do and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh yeah well and that makes it bad too because uh when more with water being at a premium
 		i know our aunt in California they they've really been rationed on their water and it makes it real hard to have a yard or  uh or anything like that a garden their garden their farms their farmers i guess are hurting because of that also
 	
 	
 		yeah well my parents are now in San Diego and and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't almost nobody there has has lawns
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well they are not allowed to water so what do you do yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah uh it is very it is very rough on them so actually i think i think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas because the the summers are extremely hot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum but your humidity is different though than ours i think and it makes a
 		a bit of a difference too
 	
 	
 		um what is your humidity humidity like
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i don't know i think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas i could be wrong
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know what what it is percentage wise but i
 	
 	
 		i don't know for sure either but it always seems  well it just felt different like when we were in Texas it had a different feel to it
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin which is further south but it is not dry and and i have lived here for many years and i think it has gotten more humid over the years where the water is coming from i don't know
 	
 	
 		um um um-hum
 		uh-huh well it could be  i know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times uh
 	
 	
 		oh does he live near the lake
 	
 	
 		well there is a lake not far but it is more run off from surrounding you know areas and that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh he's just in an area where it is just low enough that it's you know it it collects there and uh he has had a couple of inches in his house several times
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's that's a problem uh they tell you when you are looking for a house or or or buying land to build on to be very careful and check the drainage because uh it is it is deceptive
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum because of that um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i know exactly what you mean
 	
 	
 		we are fortunate or uh we are on a
 		where we are we get flooded it floods below us  behind us but we're uh we are high enough that our house itself we never you know have had any problem like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh well that is fortunate
 	
 	
 		yeah it is an old farm house and uh we really like it here
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i i like it i like it here uh i i grew up here i have lived other places and and but i i did grow up here and this is very much home for me and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh it is nice down there i i i liked it when we visited there
 	
 	
 		i hope you visited during the winter one of my one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter and you go to cold cool places that well i go to cool places during the summer if i can anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 		right that is the best time to go yeah and and usually it has been when we have gone it has been nice it has been hot but it is it is hot to me in the wintertime down there
 	
 	
 		oh sure i mean
 	
 	
 		you know  but it is nice it's uh it's really a nice area
 	
 	
 		i i had a friend from England visit once at Christmas and we couldn't get her out of the what she called the back garden because she wanted to go back with a sunburn and she went back to the north of England with a sunburn
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh
 		oh good heavens  not me  i avoid the sun
 	
 	
 		well yeah basically i do too
 	
 	
 		yeah it takes me about four and a half hours to do to mow our grass and i try to cover up when i do the lawn
 	
 	
 		well i that that is really healthier frankly
 	
 	
 		yeah well i have had a little a couple of problems and uh i decided it is not worth it i i like to get tan in the summer time because i think you look healthier and uh we are just crazy
 	
 	
 		um-hum that
 		but you you know it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot now my sister is a a sun fiend and uh she is five years younger than me she is more wrinkled
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is that right it it just makes your skin more leathery it uh it yeah so
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think that's why
 		exactly
 		i think it burns off the i don't know the the the theory th e scientific principle but it burns something off the natural oils or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum well the elasticity of your skin the collagen or whatever they call it they say it destroys a lot of that and you lose a lot of that so uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes uh that sounds like a good that sounds like the right theory
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh but we have really had nice the weather i can't complain we have really had really good weather of late and when it has rained it had it's been a good soaking rain and uh
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		it's just been a really nice Spring
 	
 	
 		well that's great it's been it's been very nice here too and i hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening and i want them to have nice weather
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		for their visit instead of driving around in the rain
 	
 	
 		oh that's great how long will they be there
 	
 	
 		uh probably four or five days
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that is great well i hope the weather stays real good for them and and uh that you have a good visit and everything and i hope your garden does good
 	
 	
 		well thank you
 		thanks
 		yeah and the same to you
 	
 	
 		and so okay well it was really nice talking to you and uh
 	
 	
 		a pleasure
 	
 	
 		good luck in your this venture it is uh like i said it has been real interesting so i hope you enjoy it as much as i have been enjoying it
 	
 	
 		i'm sure i will in in fact if i hadn't been preparing for this the out of town visitors i probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days
 	
 	
 		yeah i forget to the day goes by and i forget to make a call  usually
 	
 	
 		well i am glad you have broken the ice with me because now i'll i'll start doing it  okay well thanks Jean bye-bye
 	
 	
 		great great okay uh bye-bye
