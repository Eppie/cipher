 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what movies have you seen
 	
 	
 		uh well i have uh seen Dances With Wolves which is probably the the best movie that i have seen lately uh i do not go out to films very often
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so as far as out of the house so we do get a lot of videos that we bring in uh and i see some that way but uh i am not real current on films how about you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i saw Dances With Wolves and uh Home Alone and
 	
 	
 		i hear that's really good but i haven't seen it yet
 	
 	
 		yeah it is  about a little kid that that his parents go off to Paris
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they they forget all about him
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the oldest daughter they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of
 	
 	
 		oh cute
 	
 	
 		and he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		so she made him go sleep upstairs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh
 	
 	
 		and there is there is a couple of burglars uh breaking into the houses in the neighborhood
 	
 	
 		oh and he hears them or something and
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah and he sets up traps for them all over the house
 	
 	
 		who wins
 	
 	
 		uh he does
 	
 	
 		oh great great yeah i had heard people talk about it and they say it was really cute but i hadn't seen it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh we usually wait and eventually eventually it comes out on video and then we get it and see it that way
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that is it movies are very expensive uh movie theatres here they are six dollars uh for evening performances and that is kind of steep
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think i don't know how much is it in Dallas
 	
 	
 		well it is six dollars and then but you get um matinee prices but
 	
 	
 		yeah you can do that but it is difficult if you if you work or you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh that is taking the middle of the afternoon and if i am looking for entertainment usually i i have more uh time in the evening than i do in the middle of the day
 		to uh see things what do you think of movies in general as far as the as the trends
 	
 	
 		well i think they are a lot better than they used than they were well like um
 		in the early eighties or the during the like the Smokey and the Bandit era
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when it was they i don't think they were very good during that time at least there weren't as many good ones
 	
 	
 		yeah did
 		yeah the quality i think maybe has improved in that respect uh the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a tougher rating which suggests that that you know it will be more enticing to the to the public and a lot of times it is added for no real uh valid reason
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh which does not make and i think Smokey and the Bandit was a little bit like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but Dances With Wolves did not seem to have anything added it was just all legitimate kind of uh film and that is where reason why i suppose it won so many Oscars uh
 		because it really was good even though it is such a long movie you know they said oh people won't won't be interested in a three hour movie but it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone
 	
 	
 		and it was shocking at the end too so yeah
 	
 	
 		oh oh yeah absolutely uh but much more true to life and i think that is that is the point
 	
 	
 		yeah that is right
 	
 	
 		uh they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good i hate sequels too i hate these uh you know number one two three four
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		usually if a movie is good once is enough
 	
 	
 		yeah especially Jaws
 	
 	
 		right
 		that was on Prime Time Television here uh recently at seven thirty in the evening and uh it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie and children young children could see could have seen that movie
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh at that hour and i thought that you know that would not have been the sort of thing i would have wanted my children to see at that age uh i mean when they were young and here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the TV
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh which was a it was a good movie i mean it was well done but uh that is one reason why it was scary
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so but i do not know that i have seen any of the uh sequels to that
 		i think one is enough
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		just more of the same
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh that is what people say
 	
 	
 		in one of them they have a mother shark uh destroy a whole uh
 		marina and aquarium
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		which is kind of far fetched
 	
 	
 		yeah it just a touch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well the whole movie is kind of far fetched
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched
 	
 	
 		they hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody
 	
 	
 		not not too often
 		that has gotten to be a whole camp idea idea now though you know if you hear that music you know everybody knows what you are talking about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's funny
 		well it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs
 	
 	
 		well uh every once in a while i go  but it it has to be like somebody that i like or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i did not i did not go see Field of Dreams when it was in the theatre because i did not know it was any good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then when it was i i found out it was Kevin Costner when it was on um i guess ABC the other week then i
 	
 	
 		right yeah i saw it then too
 	
 	
 		yeah and then i really liked it
 	
 	
 		yeah it was good it was very good but uh um uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		see i have uh teenagers in my house and of course sometimes they rent movies and you know have friends over or something and sometimes movies are here that i did not i am not even aware that i could have seen you know because my family tells me that that that it had been actually in the house before
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but i'd missed it but i did see it on TV and i thought it was good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it was really and then and then uh Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player i thought they made him up and then i found out you know after i saw the movie that they they started talking about that scandal and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah when the when the anniversary came up that was around the time of anniversary and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		no kidding oh i did not realize that
 	
 	
 		then it was on the news
 	
 	
 		yeah uh you know the character that uh James Earle Jones played
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh uh i teach in school and we are doing a book called Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i wondered if maybe he was patterned after him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i do not know i had not heard anybody talk about it but uh he certainly could have been
 		uh which was kind of interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know someone who uh who was a real activist but then took up the cause uh kind of gave up you know because he didn't think anything was happening and
 		so uh it was kind of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah and i wondered who it was too
 	
 	
 		i do not know for sure but there are certain uh qualities that suggest it could be he because they were uh
 		they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse that he had stopped writing and had stopped you know and that is true for Ellison he he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh has pretty much dropped out of public life
 		but he is still alive and that you know that's what makes it so interesting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that book have you ever read that book
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh i don't
 	
 	
 		Invisible Man
 	
 	
 		what is that Invisible Man
 	
 	
 		Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		it is an incredible book
 		it uh really is very very interesting i highly recommend it
 	
 	
 		uh did they make the movies after that or
 	
 	
 		uh the yeah the movie the in Field Field of Dreams came out after uh that novel
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it it could easily have been patterned after him but the the movie did not have anything to do with with the story that i am talking about but i just thought the actor the uh author could have been patterned after that uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean that that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him certainly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		sort of interesting so
 		well i guess we have talked probably our limit time limit haven't we
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		okay very good it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay it was nice
 		nice talking to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
