 
     		
 	
 		okay so
 	
 	
 		okay we're going to talk about lawn and garden today okay um where do you work at or do you you wish to discuss that
 	
 	
 		right what
 		uh
 		no i i'm in uh well i live in uh Richardson Texas and uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		yeah we're neighbors okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh but grew up in uh Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of  lawn and garden work uh and uh
 	
 	
 		hi
 		can you hang on just a minute thank you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have no idea he didn't broadcast thank you uh-huh  i'm sorry go ahead
 	
 	
 		no so uh
 		uh not not growing up familiar with here uh uh
 		when i get a chance i listen to Neil Sperry and do that  and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i do all the time i do all the time i get a lot of good tips from him
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		i have his book too um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah don't do any uh any gardening in the sense of uh vegetable gardening but uh
 	
 	
 		not in Texas
 	
 	
 		tried tried tried some tried some different flowers and and uh bushes and stuff and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh have a
 		have a lawn service there was one when we when we bought the house and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one but in terms of the fertilizing and uh weed control mainly leave that up to them what about you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well no i had a lawn service one year and i thought phooey i'm going to do it myself because i figured up the cost and i said huh-uh i can do it much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		cheaper and better and so what i did i switched to a liquid and i do it with an applicator with my hose and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory i was surprised how easy it was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well
 	
 	
 		and it i thought well i'm going to do this all the time
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		so i found you know and i've got some problems with uh two trees in my front yard and i took them to a certified uh nurseryman the other day and do you know what he told me i he needed to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no
 	
 	
 		which is at  it's just unreal he said i needed to pull every leave off
 		the tree and the tree is fifteen feet high and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it
 		and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he
 		said i should purchase and i thought uh-oh  this is this is unreal this is unreal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i think i'll get my son-in-law to do it for me if he will but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what what what kind of a is this some sort of a disease or is it a pest
 	
 	
 		yes it's a disease that it's got and i don't know what happened to it uh and then it
 	
 	
 		what
 		well what kind
 	
 	
 		it um well
 	
 	
 		what kind of trees are they
 	
 	
 		well one is a maple one is um
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		a maple but i would much prefer i think it's not a native Texan tree
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the one that the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property and they don't get any care and they're Cedar Elm and they're just beautiful
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i mean it it's you know these things that you pamper
 		some people have really a green thumb and you know and um although i don't have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		too serious a problem but i don't know if it was from the the the late freezes that were or the early freezes we had that caused this tree damage and you know Sperry said you know that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the last two years that you we are looking at all of the freeze damage from the prior two years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i kind of think that maybe that uh happened to these large trees that i have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i really hate to lose them but um
 		that's one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard because i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well that's that's one thing that we had we've had
 		very poor luck with with is in in our yard is is trees but the uh what what trees were were there when we moved in uh uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		were had been put in by the
 		developer when he built the house and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree i think yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		right the quick growing yeah and they and he
 	
 	
 		figured up last night at there were seven
 		different trees of of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in and we got one left at this point but uh a couple of them we've lost to the wind weren't too good trees we've lost to wind uh uh
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		three we three we've lost to to uh freezes between uh eighty three and uh
 		and then uh a year ago we lost uh
 	
 	
 		can i pick your brain about how you got rid of those trees did are they still there did you cut them down at the at the ground level or did you pull them up by the roots or how did you get rid of them because if i
 	
 	
 		another one
 		well
 	
 	
 		i i don't know how to get rid of these big trees because one has a circumference of about ten inches and
 	
 	
 		yeah well we didn't have we didn't have any that were that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that big when they uh went two of two of them uh  the wind the wind blew over uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in in terms of getting them down uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		because i don't want stubs in my lawn because you still have to
 	
 	
 		but yeah yeah now the the one that the one that we lost
 		the last one that we lost a a year ago uh up up until then they don't hadn't been big enough but what i just
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		used a hand saw and sawed them off at at as close close to ground level as i could and then
 	
 	
 		the base to the ground um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh got some got some chemical that you drill holes and pour in that helps
 	
 	
 		bore
 		i see try uh a stump killer yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		helps rot the stump killer yeah stump killer and stump stump rotter but uh this last one had a fair sized root and some guy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		was doing a job in the neighborhood uh and and saw it and stopped in and asked if i didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty five bucks and i said fine and he had he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that and it
 	
 	
 		yeah and they get that saw and i think it's a kind some kind of a screwing a screwing thing that just rips it right out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and it it just it just ripped it right
 	
 	
 		right out yeah
 	
 	
 		right out and uh
 		i took the it it left the it left he left the chips and i
 	
 	
 		used those for uh mulch sure
 	
 	
 		put them up
 		mulch around around around the other shrubs and uh
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh had had a pile of dirt from various things uh
 		back by the garage that i filled in with and and it's filling in with with grass uh nicely this year so that that was that was worth it but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		a blessing in disguise i mean you two fold purpose yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but uh
 		yeah well you do you do your own uh lawn in terms of uh mowing
 	
 	
 		lawn yes um-hum yes i have a i have a self-propelled uh Snapper
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i'm sitting on a hill and it uh and it's very difficult to address
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah i uh
 		yeah i i i
 		uh we just got a a old push uh uh Sears mower i it's been
 		fifteen years now since we we first moved to Texas we've had it and i keep waiting for it to die but
 		every year it just seems to hang on and uh
 		and uh i do it my do it myself but uh yeah well  a year a year ago i took into took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season and they said
 	
 	
 		well that's good  they're very expensive  uh
 	
 	
 		no it's it's too old we won't even work on it and and i took it back home and it's can't kept plugs along but uh but my son's uh one one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have
 	
 	
 		oh booey yeah
 		yeah they always try to give you a song and dance
