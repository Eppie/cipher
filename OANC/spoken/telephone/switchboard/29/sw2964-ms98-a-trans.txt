 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what do you think about gun control
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		i am probably uh closer to being a what is it the ten is on the end of uh no gun control
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i guess i am probably closer to a ten than a one i believe i am uh i am not opposed at all to having a waiting period for you know for the purchase of guns
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i think that is appropriate uh a background check on people that uh  excuse me especially especially people that buy handguns
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but  i believe that uh you know the Constitution gives uh the individual the right to own
 		firearms for you know for their whatever their own purposes are as long as they are legal purposes
 		and uh i am opposed to anything that would limit what the Constitution allows
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i think i think that is right uh
 		the only thing i object to is like uh machine guns
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i uh i agree with that uh although i can i can see where there might be even be a a potential uh sometime you know a need sometime in the future for the individuals to have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh even machine guns available uh you know if if we were ever invaded of course now that is pretty far fetched but if the United States were ever invaded i think that the
 		man on the street is going have to be the one to defend the country at some point or or might have to at some point
 		and uh i think that there should be uh sufficient sufficient uh
 		guns and you know and ammunition and things available for that
 	
 	
 		do you think um
 		like Reagan of course before that you know he was in westerns all that all that time and and uh he was real gung ho And then  then just now
 		just this last year it seems like he's he was uh and he was not that bill does not restrict anything outside of just having to wait seven days but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it is interesting that he turned around for some reason
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i always wondered you know why he was so adamant about you know about being opposed to that waiting period
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know even before i mean you know i i did not see that the waiting period was a you know it was a major restriction
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think and i think a lot of times you know that uh criminals do not go out and buy a
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		what uh uh a good gun costs like two hundred to five hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know a handgun they go out and buy the cheapest thing they can
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and then they go rob a liquor store or something
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh plus you know  i guess my opinion is that if uh if a uh
 		criminal or somebody with criminal intent real criminal intent wants a gun they are going to get one
 	
 	
 		yeah that is true
 	
 	
 		uh the drug dealer is not going to you know he's not going to wait the seven days for a gun anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so it is it is only the actually it is only the  the uh
 		the people that are trying to be
 		uh law abiding people are the ones that are going to wind up
 		being able to get the guns legally
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know after even with the waiting period and i you know i cannot see that uh that there is anybody that that does not have criminal intent that would have uh any reason to object to that waiting period that is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that is right
 		and a lot of times like um
 		what is his name i can't remember his name right the guy in the Austin tower uh Whitman
 	
 	
 		yeah Whitman
 	
 	
 		you know he was sane and and i guess they could have said like Lee Harvey Oswald Oswald was sane when he bought his gun you know but he bought his by mail anyway
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but later on you know something can happen they can they can have a brain tumor or they can break down one way or another
 	
 	
 		right well uh you know Hinckley was the one that took the shot at Reagan and uh he bought his gun at a pawn shop here in Dallas i think or somewhere in the Dallas area
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know if if he'd had to have a waiting period he didn't stay in Dallas long enough
 		uh at that time to have waited the seven days
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so if if there'd been a waiting period he wouldn't have had the gun
 		uh or a least he wouldn't have had that gun he might've had another one
 	
 	
 		yeah he might have
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		you know so i you know i can see that there are
 		are reasons for having a waiting period that uh i think that anybody that
 		you know anybody that does not have a a criminal background or you know any any real reason to not allow them to have one i think that anybody that wants one should be able to buy one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's interesting because i don't own one  though i don't own a gun but that's you know that's my personal opinion anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		yeah i do not either
 		yeah that is true because you know once once they start clamping down on one thing or being against one group then the
 		
 
 		it gives them a foothold to to be against somebody else
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh and the hunters you know the hunters uh
 		with what game species there are left well especially i mean using a rifle white tail deers mostly
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know that is what people hunt for the most with a rifle
 		uh you know they have every right to have a
 		a rifle and be able to to hunt
 	
 	
 		right you know they rifles and shotguns for you know for like you say for deer hunting and for bird hunting are you know that is
 		kind of the the American way so to speak
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and that um i think it was a rifle that that kid shot that burglar with in Arlington or wherever it was
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yes i think it's two years ago or so now
 	
 	
 		yeah i believe it was yeah
 		uh there was a a uh deal on television just uh i saw it uh yesterday or the day before where there was an an Oriental shopkeeper in California i think it was in San Bernardino California
 	
 	
 		you know
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		That there were five young guys they were gang members that came in to rob his store
 		and they all had guns and he had a gun somewhere under the counter that he got and he shot all five of those killed two of them
 		but you know he he was really blazing away
 	
 	
 		yeah i wondered how he managed that
 	
 	
 		and uh i think he got shot twice himself and uh but he was okay you know it was just he was injured but not seriously apparently
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh you know it was really surprising but it was good you know  from my point of view it was good to see him being able to defend him you know his his property and his store
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i i think that is you know that is the intent of the Constitution is to of that part of the Constitution is to allow people to defend themselves and their property
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and and more and more of that kind of thing happens i mean can you imagine i mean it used to be like with the dapper bandit is one guy you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with a gun and a a lot of the stuff that he did they did not publicize
 		because that it would breach the security of the rest of the banks the banks
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		one of the things that he did is is um any counter top that was there up to maybe like four feet high he could vertical jump on top of the counter top and and jump down and and be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with those people behind the counter before they knew it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and they they showed us a piece of tape of that one time but it looked like they had cut it up some and that was one of the things that was so scary about him
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and not only did he he um rob banks but he uh
 		at the time when he first started he robbed the Safeway that my brother was working at at the time  and that is how he that is how he surprised the cashier
 		he jumped he jumped back there with her and and you know there was nothing  she could do by that time
 	
 	
 		um-hum i had i had not heard about him robbing the Safeway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but then there is also there is the uh what is his name Bernie Getz
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the in the New York subway i guess uh well i would have  even mixed emotions about him uh somebody carrying a gun you know out into the public on public transportation
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know of course he was his the purpose of him having the gun was to defend himself because he apparently he had felt threatened you know on the on the subway before
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh i am not sure that uh
 		the private citizen carrying a gun
 		is
 		you know just the routine private citizen carrying a gun
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		is uh necessary to
 	
 	
 		yeah i would
 	
 	
 		i mean if you are not if you are not uh in a position where you have to defend yourself you know
 		uh in a routine basis then uh
 		perhaps carrying a gun on your person is not uh
 		is not all that advisable
 	
 	
 		yeah and then
 	
 	
 		uh i know that they are talking about here you know here in Texas about having a new gun law that would allow certain certain individuals to be licensed to carry a gun
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i think they ought take a long a good long hard look at at who is allowed to carry a gun in those you know in those situations
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		like the the judge what was it two or three months ago the judge in uh Fort Worth i think
 		maybe it was Dallas
 		but he  he just convicted uh a man for murder and the guy jumped up and and apparently knew where the judge kept his gun
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and held it on him for a couple of hours you know and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		he should he should either have kept it fairly well concealed or kept it a secret
 	
 	
 		right
 		you know i guess that
 		i do not really know uh i i guess there is not really a you know a lot to say from my point of view except that
 		you know the the Constitution says what kind of rights we have and i do not i really do not see the the point
