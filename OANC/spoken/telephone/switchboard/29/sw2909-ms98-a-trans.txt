 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now
 	
 	
 		i've lost track i don't really know i i do have some opinions but go ahead
 	
 	
 		yeah um well i know that they're they're real cautious about letting Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism
 		what do
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		what what
 	
 	
 		okay i hadn't thought about that uh
 	
 	
 		what all do you know about it
 	
 	
 		uh well i just have an opinion now i didn't think i i thought the terrorism thing was overstated i mean there was nothing over here in fact even
 		this is not our subject i guess but uh
 		or maybe it is or isn't i suppose
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my wife when she talked about the Middle East and everyone's afraid you know of how the war was going to go and everything i said i said i told her i said no it's just not going to happen there's not going to be any terrorism over here and there wasn't you know
 		they they just didn't have an organization but uh
 		i i concerned i'm concerned that we're letting too many that we don't have enough controls i think that uh
 		the Asian gangsters that we've let in here and if and the guys from uh Cuba you know there there's a lot of criminals down in Florida that we've let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and the last you know out of all the Asians we brought in there there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from from Asia and i think that there's got to be some sort of controls over that i mean this Asia mafia thing is getting out of hand
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i don't i don't i didn't know what i don't even know what our controls are i don't even know what uh
 		uh we if we have any guidelines at all uh on on immigration um
 		i always thought that we did but i don't i don't i don't i don't know what they are right now
 	
 	
 		there i don't think there's much of much of one because i'm sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh most of them it's just like Australia most of them were criminals from Cuba and i think that was just an attempt that that Fidel Castro to undermine you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the United States to some extent so he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us
 	
 	
 		yeah the
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's almost the same thing in in uh from Asia because
 		a lot of a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the war and
 	
 	
 		because we
 		i i do have some sympathy with uh you know of course we have this big Mexican problem not a problem but i think that we need to do something with uh the immigration of back and across forth across
 		Mexico uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i
 		uh i'm sympathetic i don't know what the answer is i guess i'm sympathetic certainly with that that that they they want to come over here and they i guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work
 		and if if they have if they have jobs you know i i hear the story about they're taking away American jobs but i don't know
 		uh i don't know how many American jobs they are really taking away i'm so i i'm sympathetic but i don't have an answer i don't uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think that we should have good relations with with Mexico but that's not really exactly immigration it is and it isn't uh i i don't know to what degree we owe
 		the people who come across before they're citizens owe owe the children education and all that uh
 		although the idea their education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess it's what they their the Mexican kids get a
 		good education along the way maybe that's a benefit to everybody you know
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they have green cards and uh then like you said a lot of i run into people every day that can't speak English
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and and most of them you know are working in janitorial positions so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and that
 	
 	
 		so i i don't know you like you said i don't know how much how much they're taking from the work force you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i never thought that they were much i do cringe when i hear some of the problems we've had
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh um uh
 		of course you mentioned the language i i feel so bad that we here in Texas or certainly the southern part of the United States uh
 		California Texas and all that just why our kids don't speak fluid Spanish uh
 		by junior high you know um as well as us you know
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that we could wouldn't have a language barrier certainly now that is a shame that we
 		uh have this tremendous border of Mexico and then in Europe you know they they speak their French and all and they try they go out of their way to try to speak their their neighbor's language so they can understand we we certainly we don't really even make an effort
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to speak Spanish and i feel bad about that
 		uh go ahead
 	
 	
 		well that's i yeah i took Spanish in school and that's you know one reason that i did it is because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because whenever you travel anywhere near the border you know there more and more people speak Spanish
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess it's never too late i i do have some Spanish books and i've always uh every year i say i'm going to try to speak uh some newcomers language you know
 		i don't know if it's costing us any money or how much money they're putting into it uh that's always a factor i mean how much my wife says they how much the federal government is putting into
 	
 	
 		well yeah well it's basically on the well i think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders and uh it's more um the immigration is tied in with uh drug trafficking so
 	
 	
 		immigration
 	
 	
 		they have to watch out who comes in and and they're always finding drugs on you know on the most um innocent looking kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i forgot what they found but a dog found it the other day you know on on the border
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah i i think that certainly is a problem uh
 		i guess our immigration history that's a great subject uh they didn't say to talk about that but that is
 		i mean uh on Ellis Island they you know they're redoing that and going to make it a museum a national museum
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now that certainly was interesting since all of us had
 		uh ancestors that came over that way or not all but i guess uh i guess if you go back far enough you came over on a
 		uh
 		a boat originally you know but uh
 		a lot of us have parents grandparents my grandparents came over in
 		about eighteen ninety or something like that and i'm sure they came over
 		you know through Ellis Island you know
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh we all immigrants in one way or or another well we certainly are coming from Europe you know or not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and one of the one of the things that really gets to me uh about the Mexicans is that um once they have children over here their children are American citizens then
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that those were laws are unusual you know
 	
 	
 		yeah and then they'll ship the parents back and that leaves the children without any parents so
 	
 	
 		yeah that i don't understand i mean uh whose rule is that you know
 	
 	
 		and they you know and they and and they just follow the rule no matter you you know
 		so that doesn't seem fair to the children
 	
 	
 		yeah sometimes common sense should take over rather than yeah that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that you would do it that way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you would think they could at least get a a a visa or something until they uh got citizenship i'm sure they want to
 	
 	
 		yeah and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove when was that and it was in the eighties sometime if they if they could prove they'd been here five years
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		i heard something about that yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh a lot of them had been you know some of them some of them moved back and forth but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		most of them don't ever want to go back to Mexico especially the way it was then
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		oh no i i could see uh
 		you can see why
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything what the controls are
 	
 	
 		i think most you know like especially the celebrities and everything they just have a
 		uh well they have to get a green card if they're going to do any kind of work you know in the movies and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and such but most of them have temporary visas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess you can get work visas pretty easily uh
 	
 	
 		as long it's like well it's it's a kind of a
 		a bad a bad example but when Rafael Septien
 		took the job with the Cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so that you know and that's the thing with the jobs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and of course no one beat him out so you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he just ruined his own career so
 	
 	
 		oh well yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the
 		one of the few countries that people are still you know desperately trying to immigrate to
 		uh although i guess Europe now that the Communism is falling apart that maybe there'll be
 		won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist Communist countries uh
 		i guess Poland now is now a non Communist so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		maybe not maybe immigration from Europe to here will slowly you know slowly
 		uh change maybe it'll be even out like trade you know so many people will
 		immigrate here in in the twentieth at at the year two thousand
 		so many of the people who will go back overseas you know maybe it'll average out i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		it doesn't has doesn't seem so far but
 	
 	
 		because there are other uh job uh uh job opportunities in Europe that there aren't here and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know even um like orchestra orchestra players can find a job sometimes in Europe when they can't find one here and um i'm a trumpet player
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		are you a teacher
 	
 	
 		uh no i uh i don't anymore i just went to school and i was a music major for a while
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah
 	
 	
 		but i had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony so so he had to have a work visa there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and of course they had a lot of musicians from from other countries and uh in the Mexico City Symphony
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i think um like three out of the four
 		other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but i think the conductor i don't know or one of the conductors is is from another country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's like any other symphony
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and then and Eduardo Mana's from Mexico so
 		so he had to you know
