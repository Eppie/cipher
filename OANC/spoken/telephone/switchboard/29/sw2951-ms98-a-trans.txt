 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay um
 		do you want to start
 		do you have a
 	
 	
 		well credit cards um i think think they are wonderful but um
 		uh i think you have to have a lot of restraint
 		um i have never been in trouble with credit cards but uh my youngest daughter is and a friend of mine is and i think it is terrible
 		that they can uh you know wipe out a max in uh such a short time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i never pay interest charges i value my money too much to uh line somebody else's pockets with my money
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i always um pay it off before um i am charged any interest on my balance
 	
 	
 		so you never let it run up on you
 	
 	
 		never
 	
 	
 		that is wonderful that is wonderful i am uh i i kind of uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i'm just do very you know just just all depends that it when i have everything all paid off and then i start wanting something and i don't really have enough well don't have enough in savings savings you know like for a big purchase
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then uh sometimes i i uh lose sight of it you know it's it just it is just is easy to use
 		and then uh after a while i i am like you i hate paying those people interest and then i make
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		i make i i added like uh uh wrote uh an addition to to my car loan through the credit union which i knew was lower interest just to pay them all off and then i swore i would never use them again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right you really have to show a lot of restraint but if you look at  if you look at the time frame on that uh you will find that you have about six or seven weeks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		before you have to make that payment back to the credit card company without being charged any interest
 	
 	
 		the only thing is you have to make sure that you don't charge more than you know you are going to be able to pay
 	
 	
 		that's correct yeah you
 	
 	
 		at a given time and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		your budget has to be so that you can uh
 		you know summarize what your balance is going to be at a particular time and i can do that
 	
 	
 		yeah and the problem the problem is especially with young people is they they want things now they don't want to have to wait for them and credit cards are the way to do that
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and then then they're in trouble
 	
 	
 		well that's what the you know that's what that's what it is geared for advertisement you know is uh to wet you appetite and give you that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh i've got to have that i can't live without that and that's the image
 		that the younger generation has you know
 	
 	
 		i have a i have a friend who uh
 		well she is old enough to know better but uh she she did it and she got really in bad shape she ended up going into bankruptcy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Palley Royal is her downfall and there is no limit on those things
 	
 	
 		on that
 	
 	
 		they just let you come and spend and you know run it up run it up so i don't know
 	
 	
 		who was that that could
 	
 	
 		Palley Palley Royal
 	
 	
 		is that a department store
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh okay that's probably
 	
 	
 		i i do not know if i don't know if it is local
 	
 	
 		no it is not in uh in Dallas huh-uh no we we have Dillard's and uh Sanger Harris and Macy's and
 	
 	
 		no Palley Royal
 	
 	
 		Neiman Marcus and things like that and i am sure that they probably would not have a problem either
 	
 	
 		i know i know a lot of people who uh some gals some ladies at work who don't have any problems with money or anything but they they really love Palley Royal
 		so you know they it is just hard you know you got stay away or else you might end up you just can't help yourself and buy
 	
 	
 		well
 		self-control yeah self-control though is the key
 	
 	
 		self-control is the key my daughter has my daughter is twenty and she got a Sears credit card when she was about eighteen
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh Christmas before last she and her boyfriend her boyfriend had gotten one too i believe
 		and they gave some of the most wonderful gifts to everyone in their family i mean they spent lots of money on they gave each other these beautiful things they gave stuff to all of us and we were going
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		i can't believe you all did this you should not have done this and they got angry and said
 		we wanted to do it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		okay now she is still paying on that Sears charge she has now you know she's learned and she she is uh definitely paying it off paying paying on it and not running it back up but you can't tell them
 	
 	
 		wow
 		sure
 		well experience is the best teacher and sometimes you know uh a lot of us have have to learn by experience and and uh if you can learn by someone's else's past mistakes then you are very wise
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		if you can heed to advice given
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		the only good thing one good thing about credit cards though uh especially in business if you
 		uh you have to
 		you know you are going to be reimbursed by your company
 	
 	
 		that's true yes i am yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then uh in fact i know of a man who is in uh
 		he is in a he he he he well he he is in an oil pipe
 		pipe line selling kind of a thing and he has to
 		he has to live on credit cards and then he gets commission you know later on but if he did not have credit cards he could not exist because a lot of those you know because he knows
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		six weeks down the road he is probably you know he is going to get the money to pay for it but he really does so sometimes i think
 	
 	
 		sure
 		oh credit cards are you know really a blessing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but you have to be wise when you use them
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh i have nothing against them other than you know people abusing it and then they get themselves in hot water and
 		you know they're just hurting theirselves
 		and when you uh have a bankruptcy uh it takes you i think about eight years to wipe that off your record
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so you know that is the shame about that is uh and people won't touch you
 		and you've got to live that down
 	
 	
 		um-hum that is true
 		that's really true
 	
 	
 		so you have to be very cautious about how you use your credit i mean it is a wonderful thing but don't abuse it
 	
 	
 		right uh you know like emergencies or something that you do not have the ready cash that you do not have cash and you have to
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely sure
 	
 	
 		your car breaks down or you have to you have to have something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 	
 	
 		it is a real it's you know you do not have the mo ney in savings so it really is a lifesaver at times when you do have to use it but
 		but like you say use it wisely
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		only in you know when you really have to or knowing that you are going to pay it off every every month
 		so that is that is something about American Express if you only use American Express you do not have a choice
 	
 	
 		well there is a lot of people that uh know exactly what they are doing
 		and they will run into tho usands and thousands of dollars into debt
 		and they will deliberately do this so that they can go into bankruptcy
 		and they they have a way of uh diverting all of the things that they've bought and put it like in hiding
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		no i have heard uh uh there was a radio program in Dallas that we listen to and i well it in fact it's nationwide
 		and i was shocked at some of the stories that came out of that uh program about
 		these people that really you know they bought all these wonderful things
 		and then they went bankrupt
 	
 	
 		and they were knowing they were going into bankruptcy
 	
 	
 		and they knew that yes they knew that they were going to do that and they just um-hum
 	
 	
 		so they it was planned
 	
 	
 		and uh they said you know it was worth the uh jeopardizing their credit for that amount of time
 		because they still had the stuff you know and they could write it off
 		you know they can only um be responsible for a certain percent and not the full uh amount that they owed
 		and i do not know who um
 		determines uh the percentage rate that they have to repay but it is not surely
 		what they are were indebted for
 	
 	
 		oh no right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so it it they use it as a scam
 		instead of uh
 		to me they were criminals and they used that that
 		in a in a really bad situation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that has kind of snowballed i guess around so i do not know maybe the courts and lawyers are
 		working on that to cover you know cover all the loopholes that might exist
 		but i've never been in that situation and hope i never have to be
 	
 	
 		yeah me too really
 		well i guess we covered it
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		do you have any do you have anything else you want to add
 	
 	
 		no i can't think of anything i am sure that we haven't covered everything because that is uh that is a great big uh a ball
 	
 	
 		well if you have got any other thoughts
 	
 	
 		uh credit
 	
 	
 		throw them out
 	
 	
 		i can't think of anything right now
 		well listen thank you for calling and you have a good day
 	
 	
 		well thank you Catherine bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
