 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i know that uh i have only like two or three favorite television shows
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen is it Brochco who does like LA Law uh-huh and uh he also did Hillstreet Blues i like those type of shows
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 		yes
 		yeah we we really enjoy that too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't get a lot to watch a whole lot of TV we have a couple of young children and so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we're usually outside and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows shows that if we get them in bed we usually watch that and L A Law is one of my favorites
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah me too i know they uh i think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the reruns in the middle of the season
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns they start showing some of their newer stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i thought that was really interesting the way that they did that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh and so you must watch a lot of uh Disney or cartoons then
 	
 	
 		well we have on Sesame Street and Mister Rogers that kind of stuff and i think those programs are really good for children i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff and they usually
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		my son older son he's going to be five and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now so
 	
 	
 		oh that's true that's true well i noticed that my kids are uh older now they're uh getting close to the teenage years but they did we watched all of Mister Rogers and everything but even some of your uh cartoons can be very violent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know they they talk about death and we were watching uh  oh gosh that Bugs Bunny just last night
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and um uh i think it was on uh i have to remember which channel but anyway uh we were watching that and it was talking about opera and they showed like what they thought an opera would be and one of the things was to kill the rabbit kill the rabbit
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i thought oh how violent you know to kill the rabbit  so he ended up killing the rabbit in the end  uh but then of course the the rabbit comes back to life and says well see this is how an opera is supposed to be
 		and i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even uh for a small child
 	
 	
 		well yeah and you know they especially boys i mean they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff and i don't think that they really realize that death is forever you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right well i don't think cartoons portray that but like
 	
 	
 		no and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend i think is the hardest part you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah a cat has nine lives
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they don't  they just have one like we do
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh so that's really funny  but uh we've gotten uh-huh go ahead
 	
 	
 		i  i was just going to say i know that
 		at least before our kids were born we used to always enjoy watching the Cosby Show Thursday nights usually had pretty good with that and as far as um very good comedy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i like to watch Designing Women if the kids are in bed by then
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes yeah that's true that's a good show i used to watch uh Dallas i don't i don't know where you're at
 	
 	
 		we're we're in Dallas uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Dallas yeah yeah i used to watch Dallas years years ago  and somewhere in the middle i got uh bored and uh so i in fact i didn't even watch the finale
 		uh you know that's about how disinterested i had become
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i did watch it just to see what it was and wasn't it wasn't really that great so i think after a while they just kind of you know there's no new stuff they can do they've done everything dirty in the book you know so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well actually uh-huh
 		yep
 		yep i know i know was was it actually based on a book
 	
 	
 		well no i imagine
 	
 	
 		oh but you were just talking about okay
 	
 	
 		everything you could think of you know had a hard time and i think maybe with Dallas as far as they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah right
 		that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		where i don't know i never watched Knots Landing but i think they've had a lot of their characters stay around
 	
 	
 		stay um-hum um-hum yeah in if you notice and if you notice on Dallas they lost all the women
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yes so the men mainly stayed but the women were the ones who left and i thought that was very interesting and wondered kind of wondered about that uh
 		well anyway that's a whole new issue  oh goodness so anyway i don't know if our  five minutes are over yet
 	
 	
 		yeah  oh
 	
 	
 		but we uh we also have the paid uh television channels uh the only thing i don't like about it especially with teenagers is that all the violence the sex the nudity and the curse words
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and so i know they didn't pick up these curse words from me so uh they had to have picked them up from uh the T V
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		one nice thing though about the cable company we use they have uh
 		they have that little parental uh uh key yeah yeah um-hum  so i i have that at home and i keep the keys with me
 	
 	
 		where you can lock up the channel or whatever
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's about the only way that i can that i can do it because their natural curiosity you know to go towards that way and want yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i don't know the way the generations are up growing up now i mean i just think they watch so much more T V i try to limit what they watch they aren't sitting in the house watching T V all day
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff too so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings it's the only cool time to be outside
 	
 	
 		that's true well and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well true
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		well it was nice talking to you too
 	
 	
 		okay talk with you later good-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
