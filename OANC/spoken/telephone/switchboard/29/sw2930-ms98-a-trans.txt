 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there a lot of places to camp in Dallas
 	
 	
 		well not necessarily in Dallas but it's a very short drive to areas near here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you do a lot of camping
 	
 	
 		well i have done camping in the past uh
 		i can't remember when the last time i actually went camping was it was uh several years ago and then i did most of my camping in the mountains
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that must have been fun though
 	
 	
 		well it is i enjoy hiking and camping we went Sangre de Cristos to the i have uh some land there and so it's it's handy to to station yourself there on the land and then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and and overnight camping
 	
 	
 		well that sounds fun
 	
 	
 		do you do most of yours in tents
 	
 	
 		yeah we've done ours i've only been camping twice
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and one of them i don't really consider camping it was on the edge of the lake
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um
 	
 	
 		and it was at a camp i don't like those camping grounds where you know you got R V beside you and then another people in tents beside you
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just don't care for that
 	
 	
 		no i agree with you i think it's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where that you can't see people  right out the window but
 	
 	
 		right well
 		it doesn't uh we uh four years ago it was about four years ago my little boy was three months old and the first time i left him we went overnight camping and we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we had a ball just sat out there with our we didn't even use tents then we just had uh sleeping bags and fire going and we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning oh it did it did
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		doesn't that always taste so much better when you're out like that yeah
 	
 	
 		oh it did it did i didn't even think about frying potatoes but my sister-in-law she's always done a lot of camping
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she's good she'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out and you know
 	
 	
 		that's right if you don't you'll find every rock on it when you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		put your when you put your bag down
 	
 	
 		well she yeah she was she is always prepared i mean she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake the only thing we'd had to do
 		we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we and we and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we broke the i guess it's the freezing component and we broke that out of there and put it over our um hole
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh what a clever idea i wouldn't have thought about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it held our pan and you know the potatoes and stuff we had a good time
 	
 	
 		oh that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah we're still waiting to go again
 	
 	
 		um-hum well if you get a chance now there are some really nice camping areas uh up in the Wichitas which is in Oklahoma and uh Arkansas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i can't remember the name it's it's on the Oklahoma Arkansas border
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it won't take but just a you know just a quick look at a map to find
 		where those mountains are but i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last September just took the drive through to see what was there they have some wonderful camping areas there beautiful beautiful country
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		pretty
 		well i love to swim so i like to get out by a lake or a uh you know somewhere close where we can swim
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		right well Lake Lake Tawakoni is a pretty nice place
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we had a two bedroom mobile home there but the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitoes bit and then they came in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		how old are your boys
 	
 	
 		oh oh they're grown now
 	
 	
 		oh so they don't go camping with you
 	
 	
 		they go camping on their own once you start them they enjoy it all their lives
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah well i haven't taken my little  boy yet i'm afraid to get him out he is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so fearless he it terrifies me  he
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh don't be concerned there's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere
 	
 	
 		think so well it's the water he's not scared of he'll go out into it until it's up to his nose
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then try to tread back
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh well it's easy to keep him occupied though on land i know that i took my kids we'd go out and i've them walk with me along the lakefront and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or we'd hunt pine cones or we climbed some uh pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out we you know we we searched for dock and we ate the wild plants and we gathered wild berries and uh  it's really
 		you know the the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		if you know what to look for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i had my boys build their own little camp you know three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark
 	
 	
 		well that sounds so neat
 	
 	
 		and uh we cooked in a pot i baked them a cake right there on a camp fire they were so impressed i used a tire chain and the bottom of a Dutch oven
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well i'm impressed  my
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my mother-in-law and my well they've always done a lot of camping i grew up in Louisville Kentucky and there wasn't
 		i don't know but we just didn't get out my mother and my father split up when we were young so and my mother wasn't into that and that's who i stayed with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we didn't do much outdoors stuff except swimming and we went swimming a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		oh excuse me my baby's getting sick
 	
 	
 		uh-oh
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		well if our time is up we can quit
