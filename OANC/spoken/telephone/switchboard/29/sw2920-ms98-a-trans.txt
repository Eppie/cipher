 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay Ray what do you think about taxes
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um
 		too high obviously
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		but my
 		property taxes have been going up repeatedly
 		uh over the last uh
 		well this is going to be the seventh year in a row that they've increased
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so
 		um and they're always saying if you know if they don't raise taxes then they're going to have to lay off on uh the teachers they're going to have to lay of uh firemen they're going to have to lay off the police officers
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		but yet they don't talk anything about the administration about cutting back on that end of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they just they've they're in the middle of an expose now on
 		the state and the City of Providence
 		uh public works departments
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		and they've had TV cameras going around uh they wait at
 		some of the yards
 		and they follow the trucks as they come out uh at random
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just to see what they do during the course of the day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there's not much that's going on i'll tell you i mean they're going to gin mills and and spending half a day in there drinking or they're going to other people's homes and doing work
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh so you've got you have you have a little graft and corruption huh
 	
 	
 		uh i think that's
 		in any
 		city or town i don't think there's any that are free from graft and corruption
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh if they could eliminate something like that
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah you know the waste you know that's i think uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i think that's a big problem uh uh i don't do you think you get some good services for your taxes do you have a good school district do you have
 	
 	
 		um
 		i thought we always did i grew up in a town it was it's a small town
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's in Rhode Island actually i live in Rhode Island i work in Massachusetts
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		but
 		about uh six seven months ago they had a breakdown of all school systems and
 		how many children actually
 		once they once they get into the school system how many actually graduate
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i was kind of shocked at the amount of dropout in our town
 	
 	
 		yeah around fifty percent
 	
 	
 		uh not quite
 		but
 		it was up there it was the forty percentile range
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's that's pretty much i think nationwide it's
 		you know the average is about seventy five percent uh complete school you know twenty five percent dropout rate throughout the country
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		for school districts i'm not sure how they figure that out if they do per pupil or if they look at just averages per school district and things like that
 		but some schools i i don't know see i i live in a small community  and um
 		we don't pay much in taxes i don't uh this sets
 		this is a farming community and the farmers control your property taxes basically and and in a sense you services
 		we have uh probably what's considered the third worst
 		maybe the fourth worst school district in uh
 		in the in the state
 		other than the city of Baltimore itself probably you know which is always i guess a low is a low streak so actually i think for the return on my taxes for my for my
 		my uh state taxes that go to my school district and my services or whatever i think i get a pretty good return
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but my employment tax you know the federal i don't think i get a good federal
 		return at all i think locally i think property taxes on my house were twelve hundred dollars
 		and that was that included state and local taxes so that was school district and snow plowing which isn't probably anything like that you have and that included my water and sewer
 		um but i didn't think that was too bad
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah  mine are right now they're two thousand dollars just a little over two thousand
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you own a lot of property just a or a small lot
 	
 	
 		no uh a third of an acre
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it's a colonial house that we have it's a saltbox it's uh twelve years old
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		plus the plus the personal property tax we get taxed on our automobiles
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see we don't do that
 	
 	
 		and then the the town also has a fire tax
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we get a fire tax added to
 	
 	
 		the uh everything on top of that
 	
 	
 		yep
 		and it's the bulk of it's going for the school system
 	
 	
 		yeah see i i
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we had uh
 		when i when i got out of school i i went up and i worked in a
 		in a missile plant up in uh Buffalo
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and up there
 		they had like all our fire departments were volunteers
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they had uh the best of equipment and and the best of training a
 		and it didn't really
 	
 	
 		you mean you have a full-time fire department
 	
 	
 		no full-time
 	
 	
 		is that what you have now though in your town
 	
 	
 		yes yes we've got all full-time fire departments
 	
 	
 		oh
 		how many about how my goodness see that's see that's down here um  being a member of we have we have a couple full-time firemen but basically
 		you know they well train the guys and they run the show and they live in the firehouse and you know and then most everybody else is volunteer
 	
 	
 		oh okay and then you have call
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so there's like a core of like each station has like two or four full-time then everybody else is a volunteer
 	
 	
 		yeah we got volunteer i mean uh we used to have volunteer up here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and now they're all paid
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		which is you know i don't know we can
 		there's a lot of things that can be done because federal taxes are out of sight because of
 	
 	
 		yeah oh that just federal taxes just
 		more and more and more and less and less services you know
 	
 	
 		that's it they just keep
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they don't cut anything
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it just feeds on itself and i don't think there's anything that anyone ca n do anymore
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's just grown to such proportions
 	
 	
 		yeah such it's just out of hand i agree you know the the whole idea like around here um
 		you know after Desert Storm or whatever we have a plant here that feeds one of the military contracts that should be cut you know that they advised on cutting
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but because of Desert Storm now they said well we can't cut it so they put it back in action now granted everybody around here was happy because it keeps two or three hundred people employed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know if we don't cut some of these nationwide you know some of these expenses just have to be cut if we don't need such a large army and we don't need if the military comes out and says we don't need all these planes
 		then why does Congress say tough take them anyway
 		you know
 	
 	
 		well it's like the
 		the tanks now everyone's after the tanks they're the you know like the the Mach One is it the Mach One Abrams
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i don't know how much it costs let's let's round figure just say a million dollars
 		now for a million dollars
 		you can produce probably
 		a thousand handheld antitank weapons
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		rockets
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you give them to a thousand peasants
 		you don't even have to train them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and out of one of those thousands one of them is going to hit now you take out a million dollar tank with a with a
 		you know
 	
 	
 		with a one thousand dollar antitank weapon
 	
 	
 		right but they're but they're still going with the with the mechanized  it's like the it's like the old days when they had the cavalry they didn't want to give up their horses to go for Jeeps or whatever they were doing then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		and you know a million dollars do you know how many people that would feed and clothe and get off the welfare rolls and get and keep in school and you know if we  uh i just
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		yep
 		and
 	
 	
 		in some ways i just don't
 	
 	
 		you talk to them and you talk to like the big aircraft companies and all they say well if they didn't spend the money and they didn't then they're overruns and if didn't cost a hundred dollars for a hammer uh you would put a lot of people out of work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but those people you put out of work you could you could
 		rechannel their energies into making a rapid transit system in this country
 	
 	
 		that's right oh i agree with you a hundred percent you know our direction has really
 		you know solar energy
 		uh you know there's been some recent great discoveries in solar energy surprisingly because there's there's no money invested in it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		no um in fact in fact TI just announced some breakthroughs in solar energy
 	
 	
 		yeah a big thing
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know some flex
 	
 	
 		a flexible solar material that it can be woven over top of something it could be it could be put on the top of airplanes to help power the plane
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yep
 		yep
 	
 	
 		you know it uh it just it could be put on the top of automobiles to
 	
 	
 		it's being channeled into special action groups by special action groups and they just keep the taxes keep going
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh they just keep yeah it that just
 	
 	
 		just for those just for those groups and we've got like the the uh Groton Connecticut
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where they make the subs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we've got a division in uh in uh Quansett
 		that does it that does the same thing
 		so when they announced the contract up here for that latest
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		uh sub i guess uh Newport News
 		said they were going to sue the government because of you know blah blah this and blah blah that whatever it was but it's generating jobs up here for us but it's really it's really not if you look at the whole you know it's generating jobs for a few people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if they channeled their energies if they go back to like when Roosevelt put put in the C C C camps and they built border ways for the reservoirs and you know highways and bridges and yeah um
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		and highways
 		see that's a big problem we have um i'm originally from Pennsylvania and the biggest problem we have in Pennsylvania is that almost every bridge
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		that in Pennsylvania was built during the Eisenhower administration
 		uh within was in the City of Pittsburgh
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and there are yeah because see they Eisenhower put through money for uh though it probably didn't affect Boston it went the uh a highway from New Jersey west
 	
 	
 		was it
 		was it funded by by special bonds or
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure what it was but it was uh Eisenhower i guess thought that you should be able to move tanks across the country
