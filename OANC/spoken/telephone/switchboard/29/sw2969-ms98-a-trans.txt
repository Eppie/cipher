 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what you mean my voice
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh no i am from Kentucky
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		originally
 		so
 	
 	
 		i heard that the topic today was gardening and lawn care
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		i know we're about to hit it here a few minutes i figured i could make this call and get it over with we are going to mow and trim and edge
 		that's all we have been doing all  weekend
 	
 	
 		oh
 		you know what it seems like we are doing it here forever we bought a a large house that was completely unlandscaped i mean it it was probably probably was
 		up to your shoulder in in thistles that was all that was there and we hired a professional landscaper to do it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i have since then probably ripped out
 		half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted or the plants do not make the winter time and
 		so i am kind of at this point  getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		probably through the Fall too
 		and uh
 		rip up rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires uh more care than i am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies
 	
 	
 		uh how many kids do you have
 	
 	
 		just two
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more
 	
 	
 		what year i mean how old are they
 	
 	
 		four and five
 	
 	
 		four and five goodness
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've got a four year old a four year old and a four month old
 		and an eight year old stepdaughter
 	
 	
 		oh well i have a twenty six year old stepson and i do not know if that counts
 	
 	
 		well you do not have to tend to him
 	
 	
 		well i did for many years so yeah
 	
 	
 		oh you did okay it is over with
 	
 	
 		yeah it is over with
 	
 	
 		he is gone
 	
 	
 		but back to gardening are you one of these uh
 		Howard Garrett organic enthusiasts or a Neil Sperry
 		nuke the lawn with chemicals
 	
 	
 		if i can just nuke it i'd do it but i do not i just
 		it is like oh i'll get out there and pull my weeds i do not have a real big front yard
 		but i do have half of it is a flower bed just about all by the porch because the porch is pretty big i live in town
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts i do not like it and i just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff and i just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		plowed through the whole nine yards got up everything there was some plants that are just spring bloomers and i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the leaf when the blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i just broke all them off it was a hyacinth have you ever seen those
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		oh they are pretty in the Spring but the leaves i do not like them you know once
 	
 	
 		but
 		all right now are you sure they are hyacinths because that is a bulb
 	
 	
 		yeah it is a bulb
 	
 	
 		well you should of just ripped the whole thing out
 	
 	
 		no because i do like the i like the plant in the Spring i love those pink flowers they are just pretty so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down because i want them to come back up next year
 	
 	
 		have you had is this the first year they have been up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well let me tell you they do not come back very well at all maybe they will if up further north but down
 		and you are not that much further north i have probably planted oh around here
 		um maybe six hundred bulbs
 	
 	
 		of hyacinths
 	
 	
 		no i have probably have done hyacinths but i have just learned with from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming
 	
 	
 		oh of everything
 	
 	
 		because they do not take the heat here And if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny
 	
 	
 		oh they will
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		about the only bloom bulb that repeats well in my area is the uh uh daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb
 	
 	
 		okay now i have got some daffodils
 		and
 		we everybody down here calls these flags
 		uh the irises i guess
 		um
 	
 	
 		they call them flags
 	
 	
 		that is what they call them down here they get uh
 		just one bloom
 		on the plant i do not i am not sure what they are called but i do not much
 	
 	
 		when does it leaf when when does it bloom
 	
 	
 		well i think they are stopped blooming now in the spring
 		it has got gay oh they come in all different colors the blooms are on some of them is yellow purple white just all different colors
 	
 	
 		and what color
 		and you only get one of them
 	
 	
 		well i mean per bulb
 		you get one big flower that looks like a lily
 		i don't know what they are called i have always called them well i don't know what i have called them but when i come down here everybody told me they are flags
 	
 	
 		you know what i bet you they are
 		and i am a pretty i am a pretty good gardener because i have killed a lot of things here and and planted a lot of them and i i work on a uh landscape committee for our neighborhood
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		our neighborhood is a planned development with
 		i think it is seven hundred and fifty five families
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but we have about sixteen acres that we have to plant
 		i am going to bet you that is a lily because if it is
 	
 	
 		yeah it is some type of lily
 	
 	
 		and i will get uh
 		is it what color is is yours blooming
 	
 	
 		i have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue
 		which i would not would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color
 		with little purple spots that it it will fade into a solid purple
 	
 	
 		and what does the foliage look like does it
 	
 	
 		green spiky leaves now it looks almost like a hyacinth only a a lot higher and it is a bulb
 	
 	
 		oh oh oh oh i bet you those are i bet you what those things are um is a Dutch iris
 	
 	
 		Dutch irises
 	
 	
 		i'll bet you it is a Dutch iris
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		does it does it on its little on its on the flower does it have a beard on it at all any kind of fuzzies
 	
 	
 		you know i i really do not know
 	
 	
 		i am going to bet you that that has got to be blooming this time of year it's
 	
 	
 		no they're they've they're died down i am sorry they are dead now they bloom in the Spring
 	
 	
 		well i was just going to correct myself because they would have bloomed pretty early
 	
 	
 		yeah t hey bloomed in the spring
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah right about after the daffodils
 	
 	
 		right about the same time or after
 	
 	
 		okay i will bet you those are Dutch iris
 	
 	
 		i would took i took and just mowed over them last year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh we've been i i do not much care for them after the bloom dies they are not pretty
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		and to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves but i took them out of my front yard
 		and i just threw them on the side intending to transplant them or throw them away or something
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and forgot about them through the whole Winter well i went out there this Spring and they had took root right where they were on top of each other and they told me that they are the hardest things to you know
 		to kill but they are real easy to grow
 	
 	
 		well
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		does that help
 	
 	
 		well then it is not it is not a Dutch iris then oh gosh
 	
 	
 		i don't i am not sure what it is they said that they are irises it is some type of iris though
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but they call them flags up here or down here down here
 	
 	
 		well i am not so sure that Texans really know what they've what they have got
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i do not know what it is i'm i'm not on i am just getting into gardening this year
 	
 	
 		did you just  move down here
 	
 	
 		uh we moved here a year ago yeah last Spring we moved in here May this house May of last year so it was really too late to do much
 	
 	
 		ooh who who who who because i have got a flower i have got i have probably got do do do do
 		he he i do not know how many square feet it is a big circular driveway the whole uh perimeter bordering the house is all in Texas wildflower beds and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i am into that and it and it looks quite formal i mean it really does it looks quite formal but it has been about three or four years of uh uh playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here
 	
 	
 		well that
 		well what kind of blue i am wanting blue i want blue and purple and you know just different shades of that because my my house is gray and blue looks so pretty against it
 	
 	
 		you want blue
 		um-hum
 		ooh blue is hard you know do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all Summer
 	
 	
 		i bought well i would like to have one that would bloom next year too that will come back up
 	
 	
 		okay put in a perennial blue salvia
 		now it's going to grow about um the plant itself will grow about
 		eighteen inches tall and it will send out a flower spike you will see them blooming now it is a wildflower here but you can get them in the nursery
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i am looking for a pen i want to write this down because well that is where i went this year because i waited too late to really plant stuff but i did not know that these hyacinths like i said i do not know anything about plants i did not know the hyacinths hyacinths were going to die
 	
 	
 		yep well the you know  nursery men will sell will sell you things here and they are they are kind of in a labor of love the other thing to do if you really really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them
 	
 	
 		yeah that is what i did with my plants i had bought these uh  colossians
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		celosias or whatever and they will not grow  down here okay perennial
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		blue
 	
 	
 		salvia
 	
 	
 		salvia
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and now that will bloom all Summer long and it will it but it insists on full sun
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay i bought me
 		me oh i guess i just went and bought me just about nineteen dollars worth of little buds buds planted uh already grown
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it looks pretty good out there
 	
 	
 		i will tell you another plant that is purply it it it is dark purply kind of a purply blue red it is really a pretty plant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
