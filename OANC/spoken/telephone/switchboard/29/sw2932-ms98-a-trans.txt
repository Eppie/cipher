 		okay i live in Plano in a four bedroom
 		two bath house which is the area's dominantly three bedroom two bath
 		so i'm just a little bit different than typical
 		uh
 		and of course
 		the Plano area is basically with alleyways
 		so everything around here is
 		set up that way
 		which i think is little a little bit different than most areas in the houses the way they're constructed and it's a brick house with uh some wood
 		it's real nice i like it  how about you
 	
 	
 		well i i certainly hope so we have a a classic ranch
 		up in Denton Ranch style home i should  i would hate to think that anybody thought i
 		the lot we live on is a ranch uh
 		it's in a subdivision
 		and one story
 		it started out life as a three bedroom house and now has no two car garage and has
 		uh the two extra rooms enclosed i suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office
 		out of enclosing the garage
 	
 	
 		are most of the houses in your area three bedroom two bath
 	
 	
 		almost a hundred percent
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision
 		ours is probably the closest to it
 		you know how realtors are they'll say oh this could be five bedrooms
 		yeah if you had two people that don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house don't need a closet
 	
 	
 		yeah me too
 		the only thing about mine um i think there's probably about
 		oh when i go down the street i can just pick out houses that are that are identical to mine and usually they are the four bedroom
 		um but they're spaced out
 		oh i'd say maybe three or two block period
 		because it's all different builders up here
 		so it's kind of hard at that point to you know classify some of the builders
 		but most of the builders all built three two
 		but the one thing my house is a little bit different and i can pick it out again because it's not typical is i've got the
 		oh what do you call it a uh
 		double ceiling double high
 		in one half of the house
 		so like the den and the living room
 		are all double cathedral ceilings
 	
 	
 		uh cathedral ceilings
 	
 	
 		and uh the kitchen is norm and the bedrooms are norm
 		so it just goes down the dining room
 		the family room and the living room that way
 		and i love the space
 		it just
 		it's uh luckily
 		i came from a house in Colorado which had the cathedral ceilings
 		and i just lucked out and walked into this one and of course i felt the same airy feeling which i liked it real well
 		so it's a nice thing to move into but
 		again it's not typical in this area
 		you can just spot them because the ceiling the roof is so high much higher
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well i hadn't thought about it in that sense of the high roofs
 		we have cathedral ceilings in uh two rooms and the uh
 		family room and in the master bedroom
 		those are are pleasant
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's like when my son goes up into the
 		up into the furnace area over the garage he can walk and he's six foot and he says oh come on up mom i'm not going up there  i'm not going up there but he says there's plenty of room up there for a room
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so that means if i knock out the wall
 		in my family room i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs
 		with no problem
 		but um i'm not that ambitious
 		i told maybe someday
 		when i feel really ambitious and then get angry i'll start poking holes up there but until that time
 		but uh i've noticed the houses around here are basically it's one story
 		and they're all basically two
 		uh bath two uh with three bedrooms
 		and we're ninety i would say about
 		oh about ninety five percent no i guess maybe probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick
 		uh with some wood
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's basically all brick the next subdivision over from me is total brick
 		and the one on the other side of me
 		is about the same as mine
 		but uh the one on opposite the street now they're total brick and they're basically almost all three two
 		they're all three two
 		but of course they have a little river going down their area too which is kind of nice
 	
 	
 		if it's the kind of river i'm thinking of better them than than us you know
 		are you talking about a real river creek
 	
 	
 		no it's a creek they've put little fountains in and such
 	
 	
 		well that's nice uh i came from Mississippi
 		recently and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains and
 		they didn't pay any any attention to banks and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that kind of stuff so you're just as likely to
 		wake up and discover you're in two inches of water
 	
 	
 		do you have a lot of property i mean a lot of yard around your house now in Denton
 	
 	
 		uh it's a third of an acre i don't think that's a lot
 		uh in fact i have been real disappointed in the six years that i've lived out here about lot sizes
 		i'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being
 		what most people have
 	
 	
 		yeah when you get down closer in to the newer track homes you find almost like there's no lot line at all they're built practically on top of each other
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		i know i was
 	
 	
 		and an and while while there are some advantages to that  there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things uh
 		i just feel
 		hemmed in
 		by that
 		it's not as comfortable a living
 		for me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well this subdivision here has got
 		oh there's enough to put
 		oh i'd say uh
 		what twelve feet between each house on each side well i've got more on one side than i've got on the other
 		but i'm like you i came down from Colorado and there was more land up there around the yard
 		with a big full back yard which here i look out my back yard and i can see the gate i mean the fence is right there i mean just don't run too fast or you'll hit it
 		and i'm not used to that either
 		i mean i could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me but
 		to me you put the swimming pool in your back yard and you've lost your back yard
 	
 	
 		entirely
 	
 	
 		i mean uh sure i mean you've got a little place on one side or the other but
 		but to me their not that big enough for a pool but you know they're going up so
 		but it's uh
 		it's great for mowing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		from from that aspect you're right and and it doesn't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		but yes i'm used to uh walking out the back yard and you can play catch across the back yard and you've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball but
 		don't do it around here
 	
 	
 		no the one that's
 		sort of what drove me to Denton
 		when i first came out here in
 		eighty five i started looking and it seemed like the further i got away from Dallas center
 		uh the more lot came with the house and and the lower the price at the same time
 		and it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i hadn't thought about it that way
 	
 	
 		so
 		so moving up thirty five
 		i stopped when i got to Denton
 	
 	
 		it just well see now with our jobs mainly hitting downtown Dallas we couldn't go too much further but we  we went that way it was the schools and the
 		cost of houses so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic time to get into work and that's where we stopped it was the thing same problem
 		but i think Plano is so very different
 	
 	
 		you all both you all both work downtown
 	
 	
 		i got laid off by TI
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh well
 		this is a wonderful thing that you that you're doing here still helping them out
 		uh but you were working downtown
 	
 	
 		oh i
 		no i was working at the Dallas site
 		my ex-husband was working downtown
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i uh uh
 		no TI as far as i'm concerned they've been great as far as layoffs is concerned so i have no problems problems
 		but as far as the housing i would like personally i would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller but prices in Plano there isn't um
 		there isn't a section in Plano you can really move to without getting caught
 		and uh
 		if
 		my price right now for what i pay
