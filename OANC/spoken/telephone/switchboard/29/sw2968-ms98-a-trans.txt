 		you are what kind of buff
 		oh okay
 		oh yeah right
 		well i'm kind of a a hobbyist so i i read all those things that uh and being an engineer all those books that would bore everybody else you know how to do things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah well
 	
 	
 		i'm one of those crazy people that reads the directions it always make my wife mad i
 	
 	
 		because you read it
 	
 	
 		when she ever there's something i say well have you read the directions no i hate reading the directions i say well engineers we we are the few people in the world that read the directions yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		you're an engineer
 		are you an engineer for TI
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay uh i worked at TI for a little while
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we've got a book that says uh How Do They Do That and it answers everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and i'll read well not everything but a lot of silly little questions
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that
 	
 	
 		like what makes a firefly light
 		you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah those are oh interesting oh you like science things
 		uh i haven't gotten them in a long time what is that uh one that's on TV that book uh National Geographic is really a fascinating book uh
 		uh if you ever get those or even
 	
 	
 		now
 		yeah uh-huh
 		well that don't
 	
 	
 		but i haven't gotten them in years uh they they were kind of expensive i know people just collect them like they're
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they have wonderful pictures photographs and just amazing photographs that they've done
 	
 	
 		yeah we used my little sister was blind and going to school and she would have to come home and i
 		cut out different she wasn't fully blind just legally blind
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but she would have to cut out different colors and that is the best book to go through those National Geographics
 	
 	
 		it is it is they they they uh the photographers just got fantastic fantastic pictures in those things uh
 	
 	
 		they're great
 		well now i do like National Geographic and stuff because i like i said i like reading about
 		i don't know animals i love reading about animals
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the gorillas and stuff and the sloth it fascinates me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's something moves that slow
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's just weird
 	
 	
 		you know i haven't uh
 		of course it was it all books and things or was it anything say anything but newspapers i've forgotten what the question was exactly but uh what do you read i guess in general or
 	
 	
 		oh well
 		yeah well we can talk about anything we want
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i i glance at all newspapers i do like uh since the read since the economy is doing so bad i never have read the uh
 		uh financial pages more often than now you know and trying to analyze and look for some good news in in there you know
 		uh to see if the
 	
 	
 		well for me there's no immediate well what you know the financial page doesn't hit me directly which i'm sure it does if i
 		get into it but like i said
 		i don't keep up on all that
 	
 	
 		well i've only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything i thought well uh see if there's anything in there that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah the
 	
 	
 		uh would be see positive you know you always look for things with this with this terrible recession that we're in uh to see if there's any good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		with everything going down
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah it's uh hopefully uh we'll recover here uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i heard Bush say that you know we're either
 		bottoming out or seem to be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's Bush saying it
 	
 	
 		yeah right and he he yeah i know i don't really know if uh any one person knows uh
 		uh what some of the problems are uh
 		but there're there're some there're some interesting things in the paper really
 	
 	
 		yeah well i like Ann Landers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 		
 
 		i like getting the paper and reading the want ads and just
 		i do skim over it
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		but mainly i'm a front page person i don't go into the details
 	
 	
 		yeah no i glance at it i i
 		with with the uh so much uh
 		you sound like you have a family too but with a family and everything there's just so much going on that i uh actually i'm more of a radio
 		not more of a radio buff but uh it's easier to do when i do some chores or yard work or anything put the radio on and listen to that and
 	
 	
 		well i know at TI they have most of the stuff on the printout don't they i mean on the computer where you can read the daily news
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i do every time i come in uh
 		i'll punch up but they call it T News and all that i i do get uh it gets a little bit of everything even the the last page is uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		is sport uh
 		listings and and different things uh and world news you know about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		now when i worked
 	
 	
 		you can read it in one minute you know
 	
 	
 		huh when i worked at TI i read that more than i read the regular newspaper
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i would read that every day because you'd find ten minutes here that you don't have anything to do i know you do being an engineer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there are sometimes when you've got ten or fifteen or even
 		an hour off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		not much not in the area i worked in  we had an engineer in there every ten minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it it's it is uh interesting uh with the computer to read the computer news and all that i i guess that's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that that is a source of reading i hadn't thought about that in that respect uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well it just encouraged me to read it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah it it does have a good uh
 		simple uh you know again you can read it in uh a lot less than ten minutes it's usually you can you you can page through
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't read everything on some of the stuff's pretty boring i i skip over some of that but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh it is
 	
 	
 		well see that's me with the newspaper especially financial page
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah well
 	
 	
 		i don't uh
 		i read it so less and i watch so little TV i didn't even know what the deal was with this uh
 		oh i i can't remember his name now him and his wife are getting divorced and he's a tycoon or something what is his name
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh uh Trump Donald Trump yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah Trump i didn't even know i still don't know what the whole deal was with that
 	
 	
 		well i guess because he was so rich you know when you're that rich uh you always get into the paper whatever if you have a family problem whatever
 		well he had a young girlfriend he was he's well into his forties
 		and i guess he got a young girlfriend who uh and uh and then every every time you take
 		you you are that rich you just get uh in the the in the news immediately immediately you know
 	
 	
 		yeah immediately so that's all it was he was just having an affair on his wife
 	
 	
 		uh which is tough
 		well that and uh his business is going down the tubes so bad you know
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		he was uh uh essentially like you said a tycoon
 		uh Donald Trump and had it all he was high roller for about ten years and then he is now essentially bankrupt you know
 	
 	
 		oh that's got to be hard to go from really rich to poor
 	
 	
 		and so uh he
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		which i'm sure he ain't poor
 	
 	
 		no right uh who knows uh what he's really got but uh
 		he was kind of an arrogant arrogant guy so i think the newsmen uh enjoyed uh writing about him on his way down you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and his wife was very uh uh seemed to be very smart and actually running some of his business it was uh
 		she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his uh did very well
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		Ivana Trump uh
 		oh they they've been on all the news and everything in the in the papers and uh
 		on Barbara Walters and everything else
 	
 	
 		well see that's what i said i like i don't watch much TV anymore either
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but i've got three kids  so it's hard to watch TV  except for Donald Duck
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i can imagine
 		right
 		
 
 		uh uh i know what you mean really uh
 	
 	
 		well  i've enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay yeah well uh hang in there and good luck with those kids
 	
 	
 		yeah and have a good holiday bye-bye
 	
 	
 		right bye-bye
