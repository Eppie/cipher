 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		i guess we're ready
 	
 	
 		okay so what's wrong with our school systems
 		besides it's really screwed up some of them
 	
 	
 		well i
 	
 	
 		i don't think i don't think all of them i think maybe mainly Dallas school systems because Richardson is fine and my son was in Garland and Plano he was in all three them Richardson Plano and Garland and i don't have any problems with with with them
 		as far as you know
 	
 	
 		well um
 		well it's been a long time since i been in uh involved with public school systems uh
 	
 	
 		i think
 	
 	
 		my youngest girl has graduated and she graduated in eighty nine so
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness i think the biggest problem for now days with the school system is
 		some of the parents i don't wanna say all of them because i'm not one of them but some of the parents thinks just uh they're baby sitters and they're not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know they're putting a lot of responsibilities off on the teachers and i don't think they should i think they should also get involved
 	
 	
 		well i don't know if uh  you mean they keep the children they want the teachers to keep the children longer
 	
 	
 		under a shelf it's in there under there
 	
 	
 		hello
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh what do you mean by that statement do you mean they want the children uh the teachers to keep the children longer than they're supposed to or are they  to train them
 	
 	
 		no more or less train train them yeah
 	
 	
 		in all phases of life
 	
 	
 		uh sometimes more discipline discipline uh because
 	
 	
 		really you mean just  in
 	
 	
 		they wouldn't be too much of a discipline problems i think if parents would um
 	
 	
 		well the discipline starts in the home
 	
 	
 		well that's that's what i'm saying
 	
 	
 		and carries over into the school when they are school age and and
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		but i mean you have kids you have kids going to school with guns knives that's that's from the home but you know it's i don't know i guess parents aren't
 	
 	
 		and i think the school i think
 		oh that's
 		well
 	
 	
 		like when i was growing up you know you didn't have all this problems i mean we had problems in school but not like this
 		nothing like the guns and the and the and the violence there is in the school with kids
 	
 	
 		well it's just gotten uh completely out of hand as far as the violence in the schools and i don't know what the solution to that is at all i mean its just uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		to me it's utter chaos i don't know how some of those teachers function because uh
 		they are being violated by the students and
 		i know that there are some schools that are patrolled by um
 		private police and even public police and and and they're not getting any satisfaction from that effort
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		and they're not getting any paid neither i mean there's not you know it's like a hazardous job now to in some schools i should say not all schools some schools you know it's
 	
 	
 		i think uh i don't know what the solution is if the government doesn't know how are the um there's somebody that needs to rise up
 		and have a plan that is going to resolve the many issues that are facing the public school system and i wouldn't know where to start since i haven't been involved in
 		the public school system that much
 	
 	
 		well i've been involved and you know what
 		i still don't know the problem i mean i wouldn't know where to begin to solve it i mean
 	
 	
 		when my children were in school they were in a in a private school system so i mean we just
 		i mean they just knew that they had to toe the line otherwise they would
 		uh suffer the consequences and and that was enough for them i mean they just were very responsible
 		kids and i didn't have any problems with them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i believe that uh that starts in the home and then if the children are influenced i guess they're influenced by their peers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh monkey see monkey do a lot of times
 	
 	
 		and then but see that also begins at home because he
 	
 	
 		and it kind of
 	
 	
 		my son has well i i've seen a lot of kids you know and it's like i tell my son that's not my child
 		what that child does don't you do i say well see i'm not his mother
 		and i you know you will get in trouble for something somebody else parent may or may not let they child do but you know right from wrong
 		so
 	
 	
 		well i guess that's the bottom line if the children do know right from wrong
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh with uh with so many of the parents being disorganized themselves it's no wonder that the children are so you have to look at that uh factor also
 		where those children are coming from and what kind of home life they have
 	
 	
 		yeah but what and then you got what about this other
