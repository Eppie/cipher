 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i guess my feelings are that uh we almost have a universal health care system uh to a great degree except that now i read where we've left out about thirty four million people
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um i don't know exactly how we're gonna cover many of these people because i'm sure that some of them uh don't uh don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves so uh i i have a feeling since i have
 		just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this uh then becomes an obligation of the government because it's gonna become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah because when people can't pay they end up going to clinics or you know to public hospitals and that kind of thing and you know
 	
 	
 		well it seems to me that that i'm paying anyway because when i go or my insurance carrier anyway when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 	
 	
 		and the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who
 		uh employ these people and pay them uh you know subminimum wages or whatever were asked to share to share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is and myself i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah yeah that sounds like a good idea my only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government i don't know do we wind up with more red tape and more problems so yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		well
 		well who who else is gonna do this then
 		i mean it's worked successfully in Europe i've heard all these stories about i travel extensively
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and spend uh maybe half a year in Europe every year and i find that the health care programs there
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh are administered with uh at least people i talk to
 		with uh a great deal of integrity and uh people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree as a matter of fact if i'm injured or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have an emergency when i'm say in Germany or France uh that i'm automatically taken care of i mean i don't even have to pay
 	
 	
 		wow yeah well i think part of the the
 		tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money until you know they have no preventative measures because
 		people um you know just go on and on and on i mean so many people don't even get prenatal care or and it just extends with if if it what what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous
 		you know burden on the taxpayers they're saying now that one out of every ten child born in in public hospitals is addicted to crack well you know
 	
 	
 		well i uh uh i i i know it i have a solution you see uh my my solution even though i'm rapidly approaching the uh
 		the age when i'll qualify for Medicare and Medicaid i i my mother and father both uh uh well my father's not living but my mother is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they are um of of an advanced years and when i see the money that's poured down the down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid i mean the absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in and the extraordinary amounts
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i know that because those people vote i mean they're the ones who get out and vote that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal prenatal care the young people aren't getting the proper care that they need and nutrition i think
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and we're spending on these useless many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people
 	
 	
 		oh it's just unbelievable how much you go through when i just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar CAT scan and i mean a chiropractor got it in one time it was just strange
 	
 	
 		that's right i mean it does seem like we're the the the now i noticed just the other day in the paper that that Medicare will be based payments will be based not uh just on cost but on cost effectiveness so i guess
 	
 	
 		oh well that should help
 	
 	
 		well i don't know uh we'll see how that goes i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment but we'll see what happens
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh i see oh gosh
 	
 	
 		well listen uh i think i've i've exhausted my uh self on at least i've blown off steam of the way i feel about it
 	
 	
 		okay well  okay thank you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay see you next time bye
