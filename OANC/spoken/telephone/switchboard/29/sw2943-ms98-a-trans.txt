 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		there we go um normally it takes me a lot longer to get through but this is pretty quick do you have children
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yes i do i have five
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my goodness tell then you've obviously had some experience with child care
 	
 	
 		um both ends actually
 	
 	
 		really uh what do you mean
 	
 	
 		i tended in my home for about twelve years
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		now what did you look for when you were looking for child care
 	
 	
 		when i was looking for child care
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've never had to uh
 		uh it's been the situation where i had to
 	
 	
 		oh it it
 	
 	
 		put my own children in child care thank goodness
 	
 	
 		it um-hum
 		yeah that's nice
 	
 	
 		i was uh
 	
 	
 		lucky
 	
 	
 		i was um i've always been very grateful for that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		excuse me just a minute
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 	
 	
 		but it has been a a factor my youngest is now in a uh preschool which is different than
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		day care i guess you know per say
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 		well what you know i work in a personnel agency and um so i'm constantly interviewing and placing people in jobs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i've just really become discouraged in people's own sense of responsibility and dependability
 		um and what what's hard for me is i don't have children but i would imagine once i do i'm probably going to need to find some sort of child care
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it worries me it worries me a lot because i just um i i don't i don't know who i could feel comfortable trusting my children with It
 	
 	
 		oh it's very hard it's very hard
 	
 	
 		it i yeah
 	
 	
 		i always felt like i ran a real tip top in home
 		child care i think there are advantages to to child care in the home but oh i'd be very very careful if i were putting my own children in a home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		i know
 	
 	
 		they uh and even if you get a place that's just perfect just perfect you know it's clean and the people are responsible and and the uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the other kids are decent and there are programs provided and foods done properly and all those kinds of things that you think of you know to to worry about
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i
 		you know you your children build bonds with those kids that are there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and yet
 		and they're usually very young preschool age
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and yet when that's gone
 	
 	
 		um-hum  yeah
 	
 	
 		you don't you don't even know who those other mothers are chances are they're like little cousins you know or brothers and sisters and yet they never see one another again
 	
 	
 		i know oh i know
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you know i think that's a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's a factor too
 	
 	
 		oh it certainly is um
 	
 	
 		most of my uh i come from a family of nine children
 	
 	
 		and um-hum
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		myself my own you know children my uh nuclear family
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and most of us have somehow been able to work out
 		either aunts and uncles uh
 		siblings
 		you know older siblings younger siblings you know some of us have  had children that were quite stretched out in age or
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		situations where you know kind of joint where mothers worked at night or you know alternated or dad worked out of the home so he could tend the kids you know different things and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		not very many of us have had to actually have that full day every day
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		day care in a herd kind of situation and the one
 	
 	
 		not only yeah not only does that make you uh just have you know more peace of mind but isn't that great for the child too
 	
 	
 		i think so
 	
 	
 		to not be with strangers and even though they're you know getting to know the people and it's probably good for them to you know be out of the house and all that but just to have a parent with them so few families are able to do that these days
 		that the fact that you're able to do it and and that your siblings could that's just wonderful
 	
 	
 		well and at the time that i was doing you know in home child care i i felt real strongly you know that that was a needed to be a real viable opportunity for parents to
 		to have that option that they didn't feel you know a lot of people most people cannot afford to have a nanny
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or a governess you know type situation where that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		housekeeper someone in the home their own home is tending to their own children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		day in and day out that's just a luxury most people can't afford if they could afford that they probably wouldn't be going to work except for the person who's got a career you know who's um i think more and more i think we're going to see
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 		right
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		child care change i think there's going to be more corporate involvement i think we're going to see a lot more um
 	
 	
 		definitely um-hum
 	
 	
 		paternity leave and options that involve the dads more
 	
 	
 		definitely and we're going to see more like you were saying corporate i think we're going to see more uh maybe even a corporate contribution i mean just companies helping to to pay for it because it's just not
 	
 	
 		flex times
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 		well basically you know we already have my husband works for a large uh oil corporation
 	
 	
 		uh it's a necessity
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they have you know a deduction kind of plan where it's tax free you know if you put it in ahead of time yeah
 	
 	
 		yes that's what we do here
 		uh-huh
 		pre tax dollars that that you're yeah that's that's what we have here
 	
 	
 		i think that's
 		um-hum um-hum
 		and on site care
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		those kinds of
 	
 	
 		oh they do have on site care
 	
 	
 		no no they don't i'm saying i think that i s one of one way of the future that we will see
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sorry
 		oh
 		um-hum boy yeah
 	
 	
 		and and much needed i
 		i like to see those kinds of things that emphasize the family unity rather than
 	
 	
 		sending people off and
 	
 	
 		you know
 		because we just have a generation of people that are not going to be happy with
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		either parent
 		not when and our economy is almost precludes
 		one person staying home if they stay home they've still got to contribute somehow
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 		um-hum yes
 	
 	
 		you know financially
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah um and and i guess you know it's just it's too scary to be reading the papers and hearing on the news they always say that um you know
 		all these horrible things happen in the most comfortable places like uh sexually abused children it's happening with a neighbor or with somebody that they think they knew well and trusted um and
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		they say probably eighty percent
 	
 	
 		that's the scary thing is that you think okay these people are good because you can trust them and and all that then they're the ones that might you know turn around and
 		and be the ones that cause the problem
 		it's it's really scary it's um
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i my husband is a professor or i should say he will be a professor
 		and um i'm looking forward to his schedule being flexible and to mine and you know at some point being flexible so that we can sort of juggle our own schedules around and and create some sort of way that we can
 		be around you know not necessarily at the same time but at least one of us be there one woman that we have in our office um he works during the day and she works in the evenings part-time
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so you know even though she's only working part-time she's not spending money on the day care so it's almost like you're not um you know maybe you're not making as much but you're not spending as much either
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i read the most interesting article here oh gosh it's been about two months ago right around Easter time i remember thinking it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		was when i read it
 		about a husband and a wife that honest and truly share the same job for Arco Oil and Gas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to think it was computer related they were both over a department he worked one week she works the next they have two children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh wow
 		isn't that ideal
 	
 	
 		how very unusual you know i mean for to find two people who even could do the same job or have the same education to do it but they'd met on site you know and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		the relationship developed and you know they married and
 	
 	
 		and a company that can allow that yeah
 	
 	
 		that would support it and the uh
 		and of course you always wonder you know when you read it in the newspaper is it really all you know
 	
 	
 		right  is this true or what
 	
 	
 		did they just ignore half the team who can't stand this arrangements but the team members that were interviewed all seemed to be very supportive of it and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum  that is what a neat idea
 	
 	
 		and said that their that their management styles meshed real well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		wow that's amazing
 	
 	
 		isn't that interesting very novel you know
 	
 	
 		yes that is very good i like that um it's
 	
 	
 		you know you hear of women you know maybe like on flex time thing you know but you're talking file clerk i mean you know you're not talking
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i know you're not
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know
 		both with master's degrees yeah
 	
 	
 		isn't that interesting wow i would imagine that must be hard to to not bring your work home  though you know um they probably
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum our uh our dentists are husband and wife team work out of the same office
 	
 	
 		oh really oh
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh they have children
 	
 	
 		well that's that's good i mean if some couples want to do that i think that's great and uh you you just got to change your life around somehow when you're going to have kids no question about it
 	
 	
 		that's
 		and yet it's worth it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it truly is worth it you know there are some days when you wonder if it is but you know face it you know the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		population is decreasing you know and somebody's going to have these little babies and
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		yeah now do you are your kids is are your older ones at an age where they're taking care of the younger ones yet or oh they are
 	
 	
 		oh yes my uh my big ones are wonderful to help with my little one and uh
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		we are we're to the point now where we only have one that has to be sat like you would say baby sitting or tending but i still believe that it's very important that moms be in the home in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when those kids come home from school and stuff that's just
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know that's i think it's just as critical for middle school and high schoolers as it is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
