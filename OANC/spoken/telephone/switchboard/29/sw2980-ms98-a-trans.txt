 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you a computer professional
 	
 	
 		uh well i would like to call myself that yes but i'm sure there's always something new to learn because we have a growing  growing uh computer world out out there
 	
 	
 		but are you working at the Texas Instruments or are you at home
 	
 	
 		no i'm at uh Texas Instruments um-hum
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh what's what's your application for PC's
 	
 	
 		oh golly numerous uh application presentations uh memos uh uh spreadsheets um
 		just all kinds of things
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i don't do any plotting though i don't do any you know i don't do any uh device creations or anything like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		like in AutoCAD i don't do those but we have that capability here
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		well i got involved in uh computers because i have an interest in speech recognition
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is probably why i got involved in the TI switchboard project
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's been ongoing for quite a while now is the speech recognition it's uh i don't know how old it is but i know they've been pursuing it for a long time
 	
 	
 		and will probably be pursuing it for a long time to come
 	
 	
 		that's right yes a lot of uh glitches to get out of it to work out of it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i bought a uh PC oh well i bought a series of personal computers of one kind or another but the latest one i bought for the children
 		to use uh for their educational games and and for entertainment games
 		and i soon discovered that it was running faster than the IBM PCAT that i had purchased to do my uh uh
 		postgraduate studies
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting isn't it
 	
 	
 		so i've uh i've taken over the children's computer
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		and uh enhanced with uh uh
 		uh Texas Instruments DSP board
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm using it for uh speech recognition research at this point
 	
 	
 		well that's wonderful how are you advancing on your uh endeavors
 	
 	
 		well i've gotten to the point where the program will phonetically label a sentence that i speak into the microphone
 	
 	
 		well great that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it's just now up and running in that mode and i've got to make a lot of improvements and uh improve my models and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		adjust coefficients and try to improve the performance a little bit but the first results look promising
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's wonderful that's wonderful now if we can get everybody together that has got all these uh uh new inputs that they're doing for speech
 		and if if they could get them together and compare notes they probably would do well to jump a couple hundred feet in that area
 	
 	
 		i think we're getting to the point now where
 		uh there's a lot of people who've done research in a lot of individual areas and we're sort of entering the phase now where i think we're starting to pull some of these results together and getting them to work together
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's good do you have
 		do you have a group that uh you can interface with each other like uh
 		who's interested in speech
 	
 	
 		well not really uh but
 	
 	
 		that wouldn't be a bad idea though do you think that
 	
 	
 		well my company has has expressed an interest and they've asked me to do a lot of research so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i've been traveling around the company country talking to uh different groups i spent uh three or four days in Boston earlier this year talking to MIT and uh Bobrank and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a place named Sonotek uh just to find out what their state of the art is and i see what's out there that can all be brought to bear on the problem
 		and i think the focus of my dissertation is to uh to look at four different uh technologies that have already been researched and
 		see if i can't make them work together in synergy to to get a step ahead
 	
 	
 		right
 		um
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so i think that's probably the way things will go in the future they'll they'll they'll start pulling together the different aspects of speech recognition i would say that there will be
 		well there'll certainly be a lot of commercial products on the market in the next five years
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there'll probably some be some very good systems available by the turn of the century
 	
 	
 		so it's that that soon
 	
 	
 		yeah uh there'll probably be some
 		you know reasonable breakthroughs in terms of uh bringing products to market
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it's going to be interesting to uh
 		uh look at
 		i'm not involved in it myself you know but uh just hearing what is going on at TI is very uh fascinating
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i don't know that much about it i know that um in the group that i was working in there was
 		an area that was really focused on speech recognition however i'm not in that uh organization any more within TI i'm in uh a different area of TI now working on something totally different
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh my interest was spurred and then it was uh taken away because i i um was moved out of that area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think it's an interesting field and
 	
 	
 		oh it's definitely very fascinating
 	
 	
 		my primary interest is in speech understanding
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh so once we get the the basic word recognition or something resembling word recognition
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh my interest is in extracting the understanding and in developing uh man machine dialogue type operations like intelligent tutoring systems that uh
 		the tutoring system can sort of gain some insight into what the student knows or doesn't know and modify it's tutoring program accordingly
 	
 	
 		oh that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		and uh getting the interactive speech is a key part of that
 	
 	
 		that's like almost giving them a um evaluation
 	
 	
 		but
 		right
 	
 	
 		and going into the direction where they're gifted in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		well it's it's all of parallels techniques that teachers ordinarily use during the day they they're teaching a grade stool grade school student to
 		add and subtract they they pose problems for them and they see where they make their mistakes in in carrying or uh in borrowing or something like that and they then pose problems which will
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know point out the proper procedure and then test them again to see that they've learned that fact
 		and so that's that's where the artificial intelligence comes in is is in developing that kind of an art in a machine
 	
 	
 		well you're you sound like you're very current with all that information
 		uh i know it because you have children too and you're also interested in the uh
 		uh voice recognition it's been so long since my  my children my grandchildren are in school now but i don't have to worry about them any more just worry about your children
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh let let the let the parents worry about the about their babies
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but you just know that their doing well so but i don't have any idea what's going on in the schools today
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i'm not active in any school other than paying my school taxes
