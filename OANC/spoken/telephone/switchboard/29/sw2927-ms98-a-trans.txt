 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well i'm talking to you from Dallas what part of the country are you in
 	
 	
 		oh boy this is gonna be tough i'm in Plano
 	
 	
 		well we can uh complain together or we'll swear we can complain together about the humidity
 	
 	
 		
 
 		exactly
 		i guess the weather hasn't been too different between us
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so i wouldn't think yeah i north far north Dallas  yeah about a half a mile from Plano  so we're in the
 	
 	
 		what what part of Dallas are you from
 		oh north Dallas
 		well jeez
 		well then you've been getting quite a bit of rain also
 	
 	
 		yeah it's very very rainy i know oh
 	
 	
 		how about that how does it compare to the years past
 	
 	
 		um i don't know i haven't lived here let's see we moved lived out of state
 		in Wisconsin and we just we lived here ten years ago and when we first lived here we lived we were in Garland East Richardson and um doesn't seem like it was quite as humid
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i don't know then we went we lived in uh Madison Wisconsin for five years um for my husband's schooling and graduate schooling and it just it's a lot cleaner up there but um
 		it's a lot colder too so
 	
 	
 		huh well what brought you guys down to Texas then
 	
 	
 		uh his job he came back to start work again for a different company so
 		said here here's a here here we are again it just seems a little more humid than it i don't ever remember
 	
 	
 		how about that
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		course you know you only remember the good stuff but um
 		i just don't remember the humidity
 	
 	
 		right well
 	
 	
 		this much rain and this humidity
 	
 	
 		definitely i'm sure the winters are more mild here
 	
 	
 		uh yeah they are actually though it was a lot rainier here in the winter uh we came back up August it's just a lot rainier than i remember it all the through the seasons you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		it seems that progressively i've been down here five years just over five years now that every spring and summer seems to get more and more rainy
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted i really do think that's part of it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		um  in in Wisconsin and Minnesota when they get winters it's um the the winters are bad but not what you hear about it's just like down here when you hear when people here think it's a hundred and six people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here
 	
 	
 		a hundred and sixty
 	
 	
 		hundred i'm making that up you know when it's only like ninety five
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 		sure
 	
 	
 		um it's just like up there when you hear it's forty below it's probably really only five below
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um and it's so dry that it's
 		it's like going to Arizona well probably what you Arizona used to be like you know it's just dry and cool so it's not it's not what you think it is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		true
 	
 	
 		um no there've been times though when it gets so frigid that you  you can't stand it where did you move here from
 	
 	
 		
 
 		Colorado
 	
 	
 		well there you could talk about that that's that's a strange state for
 	
 	
 		oh sure i i'm uh i'm very familiar my grandparents and all my relatives are from Wisconsin
 	
 	
 		oh there you go okay
 	
 	
 		so i'm uh quite familiar with how it is up there and if you kind of interesting
 		uh the people down here typically don't think it gets above you know fifty degrees
 	
 	
 		this is very true
 	
 	
 		and it's always snow you know but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah right well actually the summers up there we thought were the most beautiful time of the year
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		um in terms of Colorado i know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff i don't like um but i'd used to go on i worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin and i did a lot of business in uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um Colorado well Denver and that's that's probably one of the stranger things when you see the air inversions
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then you go into the mountains and it's snowy and cold uh it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		my parents just live uh thirty miles south of Denver and it can be sunny and
 		and no problem in Denver and they'll be having snow
 	
 	
 		is that strange
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so it's pretty amazing it can be that drastic in just a short distance
 	
 	
 		yeah and then things like tornadoes are there tornadoes in Colorado yes or no i don't
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh it's getting to be more and more of a possibility
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it used to be no problem just because it was such a a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere but now as they start to clear more things out
 	
 	
 		the mountains yeah
 		even i mean i'm originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and i can tell you that um
 		they've even had in eastern Ohio and then western Pennsylvania they've even had i'm going to say mini tornadoes for lack of a better word and and that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that was unheard of you know twenty years ago
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um so i don't know what's happening if it's you know we are
 		the greenhouse is i don't really know
 	
 	
 		yeah me neither
 	
 	
 		it just  you know
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		it's definitely not as um
 		i know i associate the pollution with weather in general so i guess one thing we do miss is that's a smaller town and it was it was just it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere you know
 	
 	
 		sure sure well it's been good talking to you good bye
 	
 	
 		you too okay bye-bye
