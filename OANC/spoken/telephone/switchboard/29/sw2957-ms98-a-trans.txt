 
     		
 	
 		yes what what major changes have affected your life
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think that uh women women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now
 		um
 	
 	
 		you mean yourself or women in general
 	
 	
 		well women in general and and also myself but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it used to not really really make a difference to me
 		um or at least i didn't think so but my mother worked and i kind of now wish that that she hadn't that uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that she had um stayed home and right now i'm kind of stuck because i'd like to have children but i'm not ready to do that because when i do have children i want to stay home
 		so i'm having to uh try to figure out a way
 		to be able to do that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in in our society right now that's really something that's that's um
 		not respected and it's not
 		it's not um
 		it's it's not easy to do at all i mean there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the if the wife is going to actually be a mother
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		that's interesting because that relates to the thing that that strikes me the most and i'm sure you've you've labeled the cause because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave
 	
 	
 		um-hum i think that that they're  well they have to be related
 	
 	
 		and
 		that's right that's right and you know i mean i was thinking it just you know my complaint would would be um that i think that
 		you know the kids in the neighborhood run wild and they they destroy property and they you know steal each other's toys and stuff and there's just no respect for for people or property
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i guess you know when you stop to think of it these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives
 	
 	
 		um-hum  i think that that's probably true
 	
 	
 		oh scary
 	
 	
 		i just wish there was a way i know that in in you know in Sweden
 		what they have there it's really their medical plan but it also deals with this subject because if a woman um
 		is working and i think even if she's not and has a child the government subsidizes her to stay home and raise the child
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but for how many years
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't know until it and um i'm sure until at least school age and maybe longer and what this does is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to raise the child for her
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i think that that's a real a much much more viable solution really
 	
 	
 		um-hum no i agree a hundred percent
 		a hundred percent i guess i was lucky because i was teaching and so i was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little and so i'd be gone you know an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		and then yeah very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office and you know nobody seemed to have a big problem with that so that's an interesting issue though
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		goodness what else
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh there's been so many how do you just you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right i've actually another one that i a question i would have is i guess i'm
 		being you know beyond the age of thinking of this this problem
 		i had an argument recently with my boss i think it was about the need for women to work but i think you put your finger on it when you said that they're not respected if they don't work because it seems to me that
 		a lot of people i know women i know are doing very uh menial jobs in a certain sense certainly financially
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i mean when i see the amount of clothes that they buy and and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm sure that they're not making quote making money for the family on this
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		and and probably you're right
 	
 	
 		i don't see how they could be especially not if they have to pay for child care
 	
 	
 		well no even families that don't have child care i mean you know when i think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year and i'm sure she spends at least that in clothes plus you know fast food every day and out to lunch every day
 	
 	
 		um-hum you're probably right if she sat down and looked at it she'd be like God what am i doing this for you know
 	
 	
 		and
 		exactly and i mean you know even though they don't have children they they have relatives and you know the husband would certainly like a lot more attention and and she wouldn't have to hire somebody to clean the house and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		do the gardening and so i i guess you're right it's it's our society demands women to work if they're going to be respected
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		really sad
 	
 	
 		yeah religion has changed too
 	
 	
 		oh that's true
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um
 		uh uh some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for instead of just um
 		it it's it some places still it seems like it's a social club
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it's just a place to go to visit uh to wear your nice clothes and and to sit around and talk but um
 		i think a lot of people are really you know searching now to find find out you know who they are and who God is and what all that really means now
 	
 	
 		um-hum so that might be of a positive change in society
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's it's um
 		it's beginning i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		i guess i haven't seen that as much in this area although every now and then you hear about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		but among you know people i know i don't see a great you know there are those people who have have had serious questions all along and you know are sort of pursuing it but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um the churches here are growing leaps and bounds and i thought it was more because of the
 		the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said as a social to meet people and that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um it's hard to judge
 		there are a lot of things changing i suppose
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just you know the whole the whole environment i find
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		sort of you know i wonder with with all our chemicals and and that and and the foods we eat and you know young people that i know are getting very serious diseases and
 	
 	
 		oh yes well i guess that's always happened  maybe not as much as now but
 	
 	
 		you
 		probably
 		well it's just it's maybe it's more unusual now when you know somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer and in the past maybe the same percentage got them but we didn't know it or
 		i don't know
 		well i guess we've sort of run dry a little bit  it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay
 		nice to talk to you
 		bye-bye
