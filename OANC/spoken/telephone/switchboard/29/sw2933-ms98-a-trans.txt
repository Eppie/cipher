 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay i work for a temporary service and so our benefits are a lot more limited than what you would have if you worked a regular full time job
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		we have to work a certain number of hours and then we get holiday pay and vacation pay and they if you
 	
 	
 		so do you you say you work for a temporary but do you work full time hours doing that
 	
 	
 		um i could if i wanted to i'd i'm not right now
 	
 	
 		um-hum they
 		but do they uh determine your benefits on whether or not you do work those hours or
 	
 	
 		um i have been
 		yeah you like you have to work twelve hundred hours um within a year to get holiday pay and fifteen hundred hours within a year to get vacation pay so if you're not working enough hours to get that much time in in a year
 		then you don't get the benefit
 	
 	
 		then they uh adjust it accordingly
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you don't get anything at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my uh husband works for a a large oil company and
 		they uh and in the past has worked for a computer company and a bank so we've always uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		always had access to to good
 		benefits as far as insurance and and usually some dental and
 		life insurance and that kind of thing you know and
 	
 	
 		right yeah my husband has good benefits too or i probably wouldn't be able to do the temporary work
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		i think medical is probably one of the most important things
 	
 	
 		i know uh here sometime back you know they had had had given him a printout you know of uh
 	
 	
 		to have
 	
 	
 		money that the company had paid into stock in his name and how much he'd paid and
 		um the medical benefits and whatnot that uh he was entitled to and they estimated those benefits at about forty percent of his salary
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		even including vacation like you said and paid holidays and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh all of those things now some of those you look at and you say well i'm not going to need that or use that benefit but i guess it's there knowing that it could be used if you
 	
 	
 		yeah those must be pretty good benefits i've heard that usually they average about thirty percent of your salary so it sounds like maybe his company's a little bit better
 	
 	
 		so chose
 		yeah
 		yeah i uh we've always been dealt fairly with that way
 		and i would certainly you know
 		caution any young person going into you know looking at jobs to make sure that they truly know what those benefits are and
 		how they're going to match up and it might be wise to take a lower salary or hourly wage
 		if you knew that uh long term the
 		you were going to get more of a profit sharing or you know or just you know
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		whatever you know the differences in the
 		you know in the benefits we belong to an HMO through my husband's work is do you is that the kind of medical
 		you have
 	
 	
 		uh no fortunately we still have the it's just regular traveler's insurance that my husband has so we can go anywhere
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess that's good i don't know uh i can't decide
 	
 	
 		well we uh
 		we have five children so it's been good for us to uh to have the HMO for the most part
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		we're in a different one now than we used to be and it's required some adjustment but i think it in the end it will all come out in the wash their uh mental health benefits are very very low
 		and anything that is elective of in any way could possibly be conceived as elective is you know not covered so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if you have those kinds of services that while the general public may see them as elective you don't see them as elective
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really
 	
 	
 		then uh
 		you know
 		uh you know you may not get the coverage that's you might have
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband works  for a psych hospital and i know that they sometimes have to discharge people before they're really ready because their insurance
 		won't let them stay any longer it frustrates him because they'll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then they're gone
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right that's right
 		and i know that that is a is a concern and if those people aren't willing to
 		go to outpatient you know therapy or something then that benefit is
 		what what was paid is almost wasted
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		and uh well i mean i guess you can't ever totally say that but
 		you know the best good was not gleaned from the money spent where as maybe even two weeks longer would have made a difference there should be some provision for appeal or something i guess
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		yeah do you uh
 	
 	
 		need
 	
 	
 		does your husband's company have any of the new like a cafeteria plan where he gets to pick and chose any of his benefits
 	
 	
 		well yes i guess so you know uh
 		but not uh not really
 		you know there're there are some options in in every area whether it's medical or uh you know insurance or you know as a stock you know savings
 		kind of plan that's subsidized by the company and that kind of thing so
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah that's one thing i wish that we had was like a 401K plan or one of those things were they matched what you could save those are really good deals
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah yeah
 		yeah we have been so grateful for that over the years because we uh
 		uh that that's what our kids are going to go to college on i guess so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it's good that
 	
 	
 		that or retire i don't think we can plan on social security taking care of us so
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so i think there're going to be too many of us our age for any way that that system can possibly
 		even barely lessen the load we just better be those of us who can try to do something anything to put away for
 		hopefully we won't have such a attitude
 		in our country about elderly people not being able to work and not being smart enough to
 		lend a hand by the time we get there too
 	
 	
 		yeah with what they say about how the population's changing i think attitudes'll have to change to go along with that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly so it's going to we're going to see a lot of changes in the next while
 	
 	
 		and that'll probably change the insurance benefits too as people get older and still work and
 	
 	
 		i would think so don't you think yeah
 	
 	
 		they'll need more health care
 	
 	
 		i know uh my mother-in-law has had to get individual insurance the last couple of years and she's seventy two
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		and uh it's just been so difficult to get uh you know to get anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		does that just supplement like Medicare Medicare or
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like that so
 		but
 		you know i would say that overall we've been very luck and are very happy you know if if i had to
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good see i my husband been self-employed and he's worked for uh like a small companies and now he's in a little bit bigger company so we've seen a little bit of every kind of benefit you can have
 	
 	
 		you kno w
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah i i work for part-time for a man who's self-employed
 		and gosh you know he and his family he doesn't do anything for me you know because i have what i need through my husband but uh it sure is rough for him it's providing for his family
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah when we when he was self self-employed and we had to get our own insurance
 		to get maternity benefits was just ridiculous i mean you could you might as well have saved the money you paid every month and paid your own hospital bill at the end of the year or something
 	
 	
 		oh i know it
 		yeah
 		but you never know if you could have had that catastrophic thing happen to you know you or your baby where you'd need
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		need somebody to jump in and take over those payments
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's scary
 	
 	
 		yeah it sure is well i appreciate getting to visit with you
 	
 	
 		well it was good talking to you
 	
 	
 		take care bye now
 	
 	
 		you too bye
