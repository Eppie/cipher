 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well do you watch much TV
 	
 	
 		well i watch in the evening with my kids
 	
 	
 		your kids how many kids do you have
 	
 	
 		i have four children
 	
 	
 		oh goodness i have got two
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's about all i want
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah it keeps you busy doesn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah they do they're still babies
 	
 	
 		uh my children like to watch Sesame Street i watch with them every once in a while but that is not my favorite programs
 	
 	
 		oh well we have only get two channels we do not have cable but i am not crazy about TV much it just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well it kind of is an idiot box now Sesame Street is a good program because uh i do have that on videotape and i will let him watch that every once in a while and he has learned to count to twenty from that so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah it can be very educational there are shows that that i like uh i like good family shows uh though uh i let my kids watch things like Little House On The Prairie
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and the Cosby Show is uh is uh kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think that sometimes the things they show on there though uh the problems that their kids get into are are good to uh show that they do have problems anyway
 	
 	
 		right but they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah i mean like i said real life is not that easy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i watch a show that i like it for entertainment uh it is called the Quantum Leap
 	
 	
 		oh i love Quantum Leap
 	
 	
 		i watch that show every time and uh
 	
 	
 		yes that is a good show
 	
 	
 		i i like uh
 		how the how he has to help with the people that he that he becomes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone he has to do something positive to help them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right he always got to change history is what it is
 	
 	
 		so i
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		usually yeah that it is so good i was glad when they put that back on this channel because like i said we only get two channels because we do not get cable
 	
 	
 		it
 		me too me too
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and still my little boy he watches videotapes he won't hum this is terrible i do not like him sitting in front of the TV all day
 	
 	
 		no that's not terrible i do not think that's terrible at all
 	
 	
 		well
 		it but it is a not really a good baby sitter
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		it's really not he needs to get outside and play and he's four years old and he just does not like to go out there by his self
 		and i'll let him watch the TV when i am wanting to get my house work done
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but other than that i do not like him glued to the TV all the time
 	
 	
 		well i do not think it's it's healthy all the time either
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh and my kids like to to go play with their friends and so i guess i do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit now i there are shows i do not have cable either
 		and there are shows that i really put my foot down on
 		if there starts to be a lot of violence i do not go for that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i will not let them watch that if there is a lot of language or
 	
 	
 		well we made the mistake right we made the mistake of getting Robocop and that is one of the worst oh i do not let him watch it anymore because just the pieces l
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like especially where they kill somebody it is just not good i mean it is just real violent i mean
 	
 	
 		well it  you know today i watched and it is like they show bloody you know things and they show it in slow motion and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and everything like that and before in a western or something in the in the olden days
 	
 	
 		you would see somebody get shot they would just fall down
 	
 	
 		yeah and they were gone  and and it wasn't uh not like today uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so graphic
 		today it's it's really graphic they try to make it too realistic
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah too much realism i think sometimes
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't
 	
 	
 		now he is watching Honey I Shrunk The Kids right now
 	
 	
 		oh that is a fun show oh i really like that one
 	
 	
 		it is cute and that little Roger Rabbit on before that that is cute and they have got the He Man uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		the cartoon or the
 	
 	
 		Masters Of The Universe the movie
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that is a real cute show
 	
 	
 		that has good moral values too
 	
 	
 		He Man
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well uh i think uh
 	
 	
 		yeah good versus evil huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh well it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah at least we have the same ideas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah language too and language and violence and sexual you you know things i i get kind of uh saying i am sorry kids this is and i i think it is important that i see
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what they're watching
 	
 	
 		yeah they do have like those parental control things on the uh remote controls you know where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch
 	
 	
 		if
 		you mean in cable oh i do not know because i do not have that but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well my my uh stepfather and them have my stepfather my father-in-law and them have that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		they do not have any kids but they was told how to use that but still when the kids get older they learn how to break through that parental control
 	
 	
 		oh do they
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they're too smart
 	
 	
 		i think all you have to do is push a couple buttons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's it's  i'm hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because
 		now we have got a lot of western tapes Josey Wells now he loves to watch Josey Wells
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i think that is a good show too yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah Clint Eastwood and like The Man From Showy River we've oh my husband likes westerns and he also likes Star Trek now Star Trek are good movies good shows
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the uh series we have got a lot of those
 	
 	
 		uh i think not even the old one but the new one too i like both of those
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  The Next Generation yeah  my little boy is  crazy  about  Captain Kirk and my little girl has Mister Spock's ears
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i told my husband he cursed my kids  they were both born with pointy ears
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		not real pointy my little boy grew out of it
 	
 	
 		oh that is not a problem anyway but it is fun to you know seeing the show anyway uh now i like uh everything Michael oh no not Michael Douglas um

 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh i can't think of his name

 		yeah and well i liked it but there that is about the only uh
 	
 	
 		you know but
 	
 	
 		show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table they pray before they eat and i thought that was real neat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because there is not a lot of shows that do that
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		and uh
