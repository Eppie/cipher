 
     		
 	
 		how has your weather been recently
 	
 	
 		well the last two weeks we have had records  yes uh we've been we've had between ninety and ninety five degree weather with about eighty six to eighty eight percent humidity
 	
 	
 		record what
 		oh wow that's something we've had a really wonderful Spring it's been rainy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's been comfortable it been cool and we've only had a couple of really severe weather storms uh which is unusual for northeast Texas generally we have some
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know there's there's always at least one or two good hail storms before the season ends
 	
 	
 		yeah i know what you mean by good hail storms
 	
 	
 		yeah last Thursday though it was just raining buckets
 		and it was probably in the low eighties
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it was really a nice late Spring day very comfortable just really was nice had plenty of rain and within three days time
 		all of that moisture is gone the sun has come out and it is H O T  i mean big time hot the air conditioners in the buildings are saying oh no not again
 	
 	
 		um-hum hm
 		oh yes i know unfortunately my air conditioner broke down uh two days ago so uh things have been like a sauna  uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i can imagine well uh typically though what does your weather run when does your Spring actually start
 	
 	
 		well it's pretty Spring usually starts uh in May
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we usually have seventy degree weather to seventy to eighty degree weather in May and in June and then uh toward the end of June it starts getting hot and uh hot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		meaning you know ninety and above i consider ninety and above hot  uh and we usually have about the same humidity but unfortunately uh we had a very early Summer i'm i'm hoping that we'll
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		again maybe get some cool weather but uh i don't know uh it it doesn't look very encouraging because they're calling for the rest of the week to be equally as hot so
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		
 
 		right oh boy i know that it's been about eight years ago i guess now right here in Dallas
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i guess it was late May temperatures got up into the nineties and by early June it was rocking a hundred and it stayed that way till September
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		we had ninety one consecutive hundred degree days
 	
 	
 		oh my gracious wow
 	
 	
 		and i didn't know whether we would survive at all oh but
 	
 	
 		oh i guess not that's you don't have as much humidity though do you uh
 	
 	
 		well actually you know we affect our humidity a great deal this at one time wasn't a real humid area
 		but we've built a lot of lakes and a lot of reservoirs and that increases the relative humidity i mean it if it's there to evaporate it's going to go up into the air and the hotter it gets the more evaporates
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		um probably put in more trees and things too uh might uh uh it seems like the area there more treed seemed to um uh hold the humidity in uh even more
 	
 	
 		well we have attempted to reforest some areas but as a matter of fact at one time this was uh a very dense forest in this area and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		for farming and for construction and things a lot of the forests have been cut down and then of course you know they bulldozed a bunch of forest when they dug out the reservoir  moisture
 	
 	
 		yes i know
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but for the most part we have very mild Winters here we may get one snow storm i may actually see white on the ground one day
 		but if it even ices over a half an inch worth of ice or just a little bit of snow man businesses close down traffic comes to a snarl i mean nothing happens if it gets enough snow you can see it on the ground
 	
 	
 		well don't feel bad it does here too and we get snow all the time  uh they don't get that awfully much but they get enough unfortunately that uh uh if if they aren't used to it it's not like having
 	
 	
 		um oh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		snow two you know uh three to five inches all the time or quite quite often they seem to be able to handle it when they have it like that but here uh the schools close when there's half an inch of snow  and uh
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		oh yeah
 		that's true they sure do
 	
 	
 		everything else closes down so uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum well you know the one of the things i have noticed is that the weather changes over time as well i was raised in Amarillo
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i can remember when there was really only one snow storm a year in Amarillo it started in October and stopped in March or May April  and it you know there stayed snow on the ground all Winter long to to sun depth
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but actually that has changed considerably uh the the Winters are no less cold but they're dryer
 	
 	
 		right right yes it's been the same way here uh we haven't had nearly as severe uh a Winter in the last five years even
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		than we had uh i've been in Maryland for twenty years so uh um i'd i'd say when i first came here you know it it was quite
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		common to have several snows and uh you know they they build in uh ten snow days for our kids back here in the school and uh the last three years they haven't taken but one day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right
 		oh wow that's something well i don't think there was a single day out this year for our kids they i don't they don't put ten in there i think they put three
 	
 	
 		so uh it has
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but good grief here three days for snow days actually one year before last they took a snow day because it was flooding  uh Spring flood and they just couldn't get to school so they just canceled school
 	
 	
 		okay
 		right
 	
 	
 		so there's just too many we're in a a very uh they're low hills you don't notice them because of the trees and because of the so many buildings built around but there's a lot of hills around here which means there's a lot of gullies which means there's a lot of creeks and a lot of flooding
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right right
 	
 	
 		and uh  that can create almost as big a hazard and i drive a little Nissan when it floods it drowns
 	
 	
 		ooh yes right you wouldn't wanna you wouldn't want to go through too many puddles do you have much uh many many problems problems with um lightning uh with electric storms there
 	
 	
 		well yes uh anytime there's a storm there's going to be plenty of it yeah one of the
 	
 	
 		oh really okay because of that that's one thing that we have here see i'm originally from California so the contrast between
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the lightning storms i experienced there and the lightning storms back here where it hits in the back yard you know uh uh have been uh quite an experience but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh we seem to have a lot this time of year we seem to have a lot of uh where it's still i mean last night it went down to sixty degrees but it's ninety it's it's eighty two right now here so uh yeah
 	
 	
 		ooh goodness it really did climb fast didn't it
 	
 	
 		yes so it the the contrast in the Spring is so uh you know different i guess that it uh breeds some uh
 	
 	
 		well i am a little bit concerned this last week our temperatures not drop down below the upper seventies at night which means that you you know we could be looking for a very warm Summer i really don't want that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		no i don't either i know what you mean because electric bills go up and  in fact uh i was at my daughter's on Sunday and they had their first brown out uh it just electricity just went off for about twenty minutes and then came back on
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um
 	
 	
 		but it went off in the whole neighborhood so uh uh it's this isn't uh
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		this is still May it's not a real good time of year to start you know because uh uh it kind of looks for the but the the Summers have been longer and um hotter
 	
 	
 		um-hu m
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i think that a lot of it has to do with
 	
 	
 		i agree
