 		do you have a personal computer
 	
 	
 		no i don't not at home i work with them quite a bit though
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm i i work with them at Kelly Services
 		doing uh data entry
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		what do you what do you think about them
 	
 	
 		the well i think they're useful i think they're
 		in some in some instances they're they're over used
 		well that's not the right way to say it um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you mean instead of people or
 	
 	
 		well i think that uh some some work places where i've been they they set up like everybody has their own PC
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which a lot of times everybody doesn't need a PC and it really without them knowing how to use it properly it slows them down more than it helps them accomplish something
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they spend more time messing with the PC than they would actually accomplishing the task that they're trying to do if they didn't have a PC at all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and you really have to be able to type pretty fast before you know before it it really saves time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's true
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you have to you know be familiar with the like there're so many different software packages
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it you have to be familiar with the one that you're going to be using most
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a lot of times uh
 		people
 		know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly and so they waste more time with their trying to uh
 		to figure out how to do you know other things
 		than they would
 		if they if they actually understood what they were trying to do you know like uh they want to to format a report a certain way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if they really understood the capabilities of the package they could they could do that in uh about you know half the time that they spend
 		trying to figure out how to do it without spending the time to learn the package properly
 	
 	
 		to set up the boundaries correctly and
 	
 	
 		right exactly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how many lines you're going to use in it and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		a lot of times they they they do it manually on the computer which just really is a waste of time and then if they ever have to change anything in that in that in the document
 		they have to go back and redo it all manually whereas if they had learned the package properly to start with and had set it up correctly the package would do that for them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		whenever they wanted to make a change so i i've seen that as a problem
 	
 	
 		can't can't you put
 		can't you put it on a disk and then just edit it
 		if if you need to when you go back
 	
 	
 		right but in some in some cases the with the formatting what i'm talking about is that they would set up they set up a certain um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		document and it may be eight pages long
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they set it up manually so that they have all their spacings and formattings and tabs set manually
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and and and um
 	
 	
 		and um then when they have to make a change say they want to insert a paragraph they've got to go through the document and reset all the page breaks manually
 	
 	
 		rewrite the whole thing
 	
 	
 		and rewrite the whole thing instead of having the if if they had set up the formatting on the system itself it would do that for them
 		and save them a lot of time but a lot of people don't spend the time to learn the package
 	
 	
 		how does the word wrap work on that do you end up with very different length lines
 	
 	
 		oh no no you can left and right justify the whole thing it comes out just perfectly spaced like a block
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it'll it'll automatically it's like typesetting it'll automatically do that for you
 	
 	
 		and it divides the words by itself
 	
 	
 		usually it doesn't divide words they usually have it it have it space the words in a line rather than divide a word
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that you see like in a newspaper
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they typeset they don't usually break words in a newspaper if the if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line they just they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 		they space it out in in the line itself oh
 	
 	
 		right and most computers do that most packages most software packages will do that for you
 	
 	
 		they
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i've known people that have used a package for for five years you know and i would say well have you you know you know more about this package than i do how do you left justify and they would say i don't know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it would take me maybe two or three minutes looking in the manual to figure out what command it was to caused this to happen
 		and they would say how did you do that and i'm like well it's really easy and they were like well i never knew that and that obviously they'd never considered looking it up you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you think it's a lack of training um or it's just that they don't use the materials that are available to them
 	
 	
 		sometimes it's sometimes well it's it's a number of different things sometimes they don't uh
 		they don't think that they can get any information out of the manual some manuals aren't really designed very well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but some of them are and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it that just a a basic general user can understand them so i think um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		people think it's going to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would and so they're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time because they think well it's quicker just to do it myself when it's really not
 	
 	
 		right um-hum it's better to learn it directly from the manual
 	
 	
 		well i think so
 	
 	
 		especially when you have to trouble shoot some things
 	
 	
 		um-hum exactly
 	
 	
 		because a lot of the times the computer  the program still has uh bugs in it and you have to work around it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		hm have you worked mostly on IBM um
 	
 	
 		uh the the with PC's they're either IBM or IBM compatible mostly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's uh
 	
 	
 		that is you know the industry standard
 	
 	
 		that's all i've seen in offices is IBM um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		there's a lot of of really good IBM compatibles
 		too they don't have to necessarily be the IBM brand but they have to adhere to that industry standard
 	
 	
 		right
 		well do you think it's been five minutes yet or
 	
 	
 		oh probably
 	
 	
 		oh okay well well it was nice talking to you thank you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
