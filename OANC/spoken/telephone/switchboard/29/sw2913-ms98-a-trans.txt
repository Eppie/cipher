 		but he's a turtle fanatic he even had turtle cake yesterday  but i've been wanting to see Turtle too is it as good as they say it is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it was it was actually better than the first one i thought
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		what's the last movie you saw
 	
 	
 		Ghost
 	
 	
 		oh we were just when when the topic came up we i was asking my husband right quick what's the last movies we saw he said well Ghost and Turtles i really liked it
 	
 	
 		now Ghost yeah i love tear jerker movies but that wasn't too bad on tear jerker but
 	
 	
 		not too awful bad
 	
 	
 		it was oh it was good movie though i can see why it won so many Oscars  because that was just so good and i like Demi Moore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		did you see Pretty Woman
 	
 	
 		no but i've been hearing a lot about it i don't we don't get to the video store very often and we don't have cable
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		well we don't really want cable it's just you know glued to the TV all the time anyway so we get two channels down here  thanks  i'm from Kentucky originally and we used to get five channels without cable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know forty well uh i don't think y'all have the same channels but here in Texas we only get two channels and that's um
 		do you watch soap operas
 	
 	
 		uh once in a while when i'm home
 	
 	
 		okay you work then okay well we get the channel with Young and the Restless on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and then uh
 		i think General Hospital and that comes on different channel
 	
 	
 		yeah it does
 	
 	
 		but that's all we get and that's no cartoons for my little boy but we've got a VCR and a lot of tapes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh my husband's a movie fanatic
 	
 	
 		i think you'd really like Pretty Woman it was it was really a it made you feel really good it was just a happy movie
 	
 	
 		oh what about Total Recall have you seen that
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i saw that one
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		i i was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was
 	
 	
 		yeah it was violent i try to get away from that my little boy oh he loves Robocop
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that movie i have to i'll fast forward it everytime they come to the part where there's have you seen it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the part where they're shooting Mercy
 	
 	
 		i don't like that
 	
 	
 		that it oh that's horrible  that is horrible and their their the language on that's filthy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't see why they have to do that i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean know everybody knows that it that the the language is there so they could just ignore it and
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		use different words instead i think
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but i i think lately Pretty Woman's been my favorite i went and bought the video i've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times
 	
 	
 		um my husband bought me like um uh i think Pretty in Pink for my birthday  with a  wait a second  the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i will in a minute Kyle  sorry um he bought me pretty in pink just a second
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 	
 	
 		Kyle i'm on the telephone i'll be right i'll be right there  sorry  now you're glad you ain't got a four year old
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it this the first time he's interrupted my phone calls
 	
 	
 		now
 		now i haven't seen Pretty in Pink that had um
 	
 	
 		Molly Ringwald yeah it was cute but it wasn't i like the um Sixteen Candles or sixteenth birthday or
 	
 	
 		does that have Molly Ringwald
 		i think i think Sixteen Candles was the name of it
 	
 	
 		yeah oh that was so good of course i was a teenager when i seen that and i loved it
 	
 	
 		i haven't seen it either
 	
 	
 		oh well if you like love stories it's sweet oh it's sweet
 	
 	
 		i do
 	
 	
 		it really is and that's a tear jerker it gets you  i mean it makes you feel really sorry for her  but it's hilarious too especially with that uh little guy in it oh he looks like a little
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		i don't know he  looks like a little boy next door
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but he's sixteen oh it's a cute movie i can't remember his name he kind of looks like Doogie Howser
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hm i don't know
 	
 	
 		don't know either he's got curly blonde hair he just a little freckly little
 	
 	
 		but
 		probably know him if i saw him
 	
 	
 		boy yeah if i could remember the name i know you'd know his name because he's played in a few movies but uh
 	
 	
 		i was just thinking another good one i saw not too long ago was um Sleeping with the Enemy
 	
 	
 		okay i've heard about that but i can't remember it
 	
 	
 		that that's
 		that's Julia Roberts' new movie
 	
 	
 		okay yeah Julia Roberts is good
 	
 	
 		yeah she's this one you know Pretty Woman was kind of a light comedy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a romance and and this one was
 		a lot more dramatic
 	
 	
 		wasn't it a murder mystery
 	
 	
 		it it
 		well it
 	
 	
 		like sort of
 	
 	
 		it was like uh it was a mystery it was a mystery she disappeared from her husband uh husband who was abusing her
 	
 	
 		oh okay the yeah that's the one i wanted to see where he was on she was on a carnival at a carnival on a ferris wheel or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well did that come on TV or did it come out in the
 	
 	
 		no it came out in the theater
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		and i think you know around here it's already quit playing but i don't i don't know if it's still playing anywhere else
 	
 	
 		oh i i'd like
 	
 	
 		but it was it was it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat
 	
 	
 		real good
 		i want to see that yeah i seen the uh previews for it on TV down here it's but it's just been down here a couple weeks i think
 	
 	
 		oh okay because we saw it probably
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		four or five months ago
 	
 	
 		a month is
 		well i know it hasn't been that long since i've seen the previews for it but yeah i wanted to see it her husband was that was a dark haired guy with a beard and moustache or
 	
 	
 		yeah he's uh he was a real psycho in the movie it was it was scary
 	
 	
 		and no he shaved the beard off
 		yeah
 		oh i'd like to see that what about oh there was a
 		we got one back here a while oh i want to see War of the Roses too have you seen that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah boy uh i i didn't like it no it was i didn't like the way it ended
 	
 	
 		you didn't
 		i know well the only reason i know why it ended is on Arsenio Hall one night Christopher Reeves
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		told that you know i can't believe they killed them  or or or who was it Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas
 	
 	
 		
 
 		might have been Michael Douglas oh that starred in it yeah it was Michael Douglas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		Christopher Reeve wasn't in it at all
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		okay well Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that i can't believe they killed them and Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas went after his throat you dummy  so i know that they die but i haven't told my husband we've both been wanting to see it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		it was i i it was it was weird it was a different movie from anything i've ever seen
 	
 	
 		that's what well we was uh teasing about you know splitting our house down the middle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they did that didn't they and they marked off routes that they could go or something
 	
 	
 		yeah that'd be kind of hard for us we've only got one bathroom i don't
 	
 	
 		we've got two bathrooms but well it might actually if he takes my my house kind of looks like two trailers put together  and one bathroom is at the end of of one side and one's in the middle of the other so we could do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		well that wouldn't be too bad
 	
 	
 		no and he could climb out the window  well and we our whole house has you know every room leads to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		did
 	
 	
 		three rooms so we can you know yeah well yeah you can get around  you just can't go out the front door honey  sorry
 	
 	
 		get around
 		well did you see Fatal Attraction
 	
 	
 		yeah that's coming back on too
 	
 	
 		i know it's going to be on on the on CBS Tuesday night and and that's kind of what in a way you know how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff that's kind of how War of the Roses was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm well
 	
 	
 		parts of parts of War of the Roses was funny but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling you know
 	
 	
 		eerie feeling or i want to see it though i'd like to see that and uh The Never Ending Story came out on Disney this month i think i wanted to see that
 	
 	
 		i i've heard about that but i don't know what it's about

 		oh he's saving the land of uh oh it's been so long since i've seen it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all i know is all's i can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge
 		sheep dog sort of looking thing it flies through the air and he's trying to save the land from some ooze  but it's really good i mean it sounds kind it it had uh Fred Savage in it
