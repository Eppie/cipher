 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right so uh what about automobiles
 	
 	
 		well i drive a pick up truck
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		you should live in Texas
 	
 	
 		that's probably true it it's a small pickup truck though it's one of those Isuzu uh space cab types with a sunroof so it's actually not a real pickup truck you know it's uh it's got nice bucket seats so it's very comfortable and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it has uh with the space cab in the back i can carry some storage but i have to admit Fred i i've never had a gun rack back there so i probably wouldn't fit in Texas
 	
 	
 		uh oh you're in trouble
 		
 
 		you don't have a
 		Yosemite Sam mud flap back off or anything like that
 	
 	
 		no no  no no nothing like that it my it's pretty pretty i think uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my truck sort of puts me as a uh as as a Baltimore Baltimore suburbanite i think is more uh you know i uh when i bought the truck i was going to buy a boat
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i needed something that would be able to haul a small boat but then i i um i because i wanted to try water skiing and enjoying some water sports and things and that's one reason why i bought it but then right after i bought the truck i broke my foot
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i and the doctor said because of the type of physical therapy i got no sideward movement you know for a couple of months and that meant the whole
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		season uh water skiing you know uh season was over so i thought well okay and then by the the next year i was thinking about doing it again but i invested the money in a house
 	
 	
 		oh well probably that's probably a little more sound investment
 	
 	
 		you know so
 		little more sound investment yes so so then i still have this pickup truck and then i think well now maybe i'll you know go by the boat again and of course then i broke my foot again uh so the thought
 	
 	
 		
 
 		perhaps you should just uh dispel that thought
 	
 	
 		yeah that so that's so i'm not ever going going to own a boat
 	
 	
 		but you still like your truck though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah i love my truck in fact uh well my wife and i contemplate selling both of us owned pickup trucks actually when we got married so we now we're a two pickup truck family
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh hers in in some ways is is a little more convenient and then mine's convenient other ways so it's hard to decide she has a a cap on the back and and uh she has um
 		uh roof racks so we were able to carry things on the roof and able to put things in the back of her truck without them ever worrying about them them getting wet or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but with mine see i have a space cab so you can put like luggage immediately behind the seats and i also have bucket seats
 		and air conditioning  so each one has its good points and each one has its bad points in a two truck family yeah uh what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah do you feel that
 		uh you're the always the guy that gets called when someone moves or something
 	
 	
 		i think family um i do a little bit but surprisingly i have uh two of my brothers since i bought my Isuzu pickup two of my brothers have bought uh Isuzu Troopers
 		which actually you know can open the back and just take out your backseat and you can haul washers and dryers and almost anything in them so i think um i used to be
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the one that was called but now everybody owns one themselves you know i do have some friends every once in a while that'll ask me and i'll i'll of course do that you know that doesn't matter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it's for for a friend you'd do it anyway so it doesn't really matter
 	
 	
 		yeah that's uh it just seems that uh i don't know if i'd ever want to own one because
 		i know i've used guys with pickup trucks two or three times and and they you know what are you doing this weekend well i'm helping a guy move you know and it just seems like they're always getting the call
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah that's true what type of car do you drive Fred
 	
 	
 		well i have a eighty five Mercury Cougar and i've had it since well eighty six actually so it was still fairly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know it was a new style when it came out and uh my wife drives and eighty seven Topaz or an wait an eighty eighty seven Topaz yeah that's right and so we're a Mercury family i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um not so much on her part but i don't know my dad always bought Ford and Mercury products so and i like the looks of the Cougar
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		yeah they're nice looking i like them
 	
 	
 		yeah thanks and uh except for i got a some Texas hail storm damage it's a little golf ball action so i've got
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		driving driving around a with a Chinese checker board basically
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		i got that about a year and a half ago actually two years ago this May and i just totaled out the car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so it paid for itself and i'm basically driving uh almost a free car so
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's see that's what i'm hoping to stop paying truck payments soon you know that's i think that's payments are important what you so but your wife drives a Mercury Topaz they're nice too
 	
 	
 		yeah we haven't had a trouble with either of them yet uh her Topaz uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh my Cougar's got like eighty some thousand miles on it it's made trips because we're both from Indiana and she moved down here first she she pardon
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah so you've gone
 		yeah back to visit family
 		have you driven back to visit family
 		in Indiana
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i've made the trip probably ten times because i was still going to school and she was down here and so it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's just racks up you know about sixteen hundred miles each time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and we just started going in Carla's car the Topaz and it seems to make the trip pretty well it's getting around thirty five forty miles per gallon
 	
 	
 		oh that's really good yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it is especially we we were weighting it down a little bit it get it you know on the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it averaged out around thirty five or forty forty
 	
 	
 		yeah is uh gas mileage an important reason why you buy the cars you do
 	
 	
 		probably uh the Cougar i got it just for its looks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh the the Mercury brand and uh  Carla wanted a
 		a car that got  good gas mileage a little something to get around town and uh dependable and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it it it's kind of a sportier model than most Topazes it's got the the stripping on the side and it came with uh i think Eagle tires
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some guy had some salesman had decked it out and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it it looked pretty sharp
 	
 	
 		well i i take it you don't have you don't have kids then
 	
 	
 		no no we we just got a new puppy but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's close enough
 	
 	
 		because if you had if you had kids you wouldn't say anything about sportier looking you'd be saying things like it has a good backseat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh the car seat fits in very easily and we can seat belt it in securely it's that's that's a big difference in conversations there  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh so you don't you don't have children or
 	
 	
 		no we well we're uh just recently married in December
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh but that's we we laugh now my wife says we should sell my truck and i say we should sell hers
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i said well the reason why we should sell yours Laura is because see mine has the space cab and it actually has little drop seats in the space area with seat belts i said and we can seat buckle in a car seat there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we should get rid of yours because the three of us won't be able to go on trips i said but we can go on trips in mine you know we can travel anywhere with my truck so that's uh you know we laugh i laugh about that um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's funny uh see that's true i never thought of that and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know oh it's a good child and you know loading up the kids you know we haven't crossed that yet so
 	
 	
 		i know  we haven't either but
 	
 	
 		have you seen these new station wagons they look pretty sharp
 	
 	
 		well what the Ford ones
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know what it was i just saw it going down and mom and the kids were in there and it looked like a pretty sleek looking car
 	
 	
 		yeah i think uh i think Ford was one of the first ones to step into that new um that new almost shuttle space shuttle like appearance and i think they've done they've really come on strong with some of that um
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		uh wind resistance and energy saving and uh uh developments i think that that's their station wagon i think those are Fords but i do i like those
 	
 	
 		okay
 		no more of the the panel station wagons anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah now now the station wagon looks sleek it looks yeah
 	
 	
 		i know they do look pretty sharp
 	
 	
 		and uh and hopefully i think uh you know it's supposed to get better gas mileage and um i think that's that's becoming an important thing too my wife and i've been discussing is you know looking for a car when we do get rid of one of the trucks we'll probably look for a car that gets good gas mileage
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just because um
 		it it just has become such an important thing i think for the environment and for the economy and everything you know to start to pay attention to that more and more
 	
 	
 		so you you bought an Isuzu so you're not a a the buy American crowd or
 	
 	
 		no i think i think the reason why i i bought the Isuzu is because you know i looked almost all the small trucks are made by Japanese anyway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's only a couple of them like i looked the first place i went were the were Dodge Chrysler Plymouth and you know i went to a number of them and i priced them all out and i was just the the i was almost going to buy a um a Chrysler which was actually a Mitsubishi truck
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the salesman insulted me um the guy the salesman you know they always do that deal with you where they say well i got to go talk to my manager well here the manager's actually the guy that owns the place and in this small town we live on he's always on TV
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he comes out of his office and i asked him for i i i said well you know it was like maybe eighty three hundred dollars for this truck
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i said well i i'd like it for eight thousand dollars i said for eight thousand dollars i'll sell you know i'll write out the down payment now and you know because i can get financing i can get financing through my credit
 		because i'd checked about financing and everything you know i said i'll for eight thousand dollars i'll take it you know because it was oh sort of marked down you know and the and the guy came out of the back and insulted me he said
 		he said you want a truck for under eight thousand dollars go back to the used lot it's behind the building and he walked away
 	
 	
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		i guess it was a sales technique he thought he was going to pressure me into giving up that three hundred dollars that i asked for i don't know and i said i said i looked at the salesman i said i'm i'm sorry your boss just insulted me i can't it's against my pride to buy a truck here now
 	
 	
 		that
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		and guy and i felt really bad i walked out and the guy
 		called me at home the next couple of days it was terrible but you know i walked out i got into my brother was actually with me shopping for a car and we drove down the street
 		and he said why don't you just look in here and we went into the Isuzu dealer because my brother always had this love for an Isuzu Trooper he wanted one you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we walked in and here there was a demonstrator model on sale like ninety six hundred dollars with everything standard
