 
     		
 	
 		okay Kate uh do you play golf
 	
 	
 		um i have played golf in the past i'm not very good at it even though i'm pretty well sports minded um there's something about holding that club in my hand that i want to hold it like a baseball bat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so i can putt but i have a terrible time driving
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's very similar to me
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		i just uh haven't taken the time to learn the fundamentals of the game i just go out and try to be Joe Athlete and think that i can just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know use transfer skills from like you said softball or baseball
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and i've got that baseball swing and i hook everything viciously so i have to aim like forty five degrees off to the to the right and hopefully it curves back in and usually i end up uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		going from one side of the fairway to the other and not straight down the middle
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah like you're supposed to well i even uh took a golf lesson
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		six weeks i guess worth of golf lessons and and i had a terrible time trying to remember uh where your hands are supposed to be and over this way and under that way and keep your legs this way and it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		extremely difficult considering how easy it looks when the pros do it and so uh i played for a while that way but i can go play Putt Putt Golf really well that's the kind of that's the kind of stuff i can go for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh yeah
 		
 
 		do you watch golf on TV a lot
 	
 	
 		um i watch some of the things because my father is an avid golf fan he he watches every game he goes out every single day his whole stance
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the way he walks is a golfer's walk  if there is such a thing and so he uh he's gotten me interested in it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i have my own putters and and you know some some equipment but um the only thing that i would probably watch is like things that are local like the Byron Nelson Classic that's coming up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and then there's another one out let me see off of one twenty one coming up pretty soon so i like to watch things that are close uh by to see if there's any names that are familiar with Texas
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i we don't have a TV so we don't watch much golf
 	
 	
 		uh-huh no i can't imagine watching much golf without a TV
 	
 	
 		yeah so we don't go out to the local uh uh golf course and watch amateurs very often so uh uh but you know when i was younger when i was into it i'd watch it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		every now and then if if baseball or basketball or something else wasn't on and golf was always the uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the if nothing else is on i'll watch golf
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i don't know it's it's pretty it's neat watching i really enjoy watching the highlights like on ESPN Sports Center when they show the great shots and everything i mean that's fun but i don't i'm not up for watching the whole game like i do for baseball or basketball
 	
 	
 		yes yes um-hum
 		right right yeah well at least with now with the with the sports uh and and the TV is um they can get the camera's
 		just at the time the people are starting to swing so it makes it a little bit faster and um a little bit more interesting but i think it's it's more interesting to go out and watch them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh than it is on the TV and and to follow like one or two people along on the golf course and then you you almost feel like you are
 		in doing exactly what they are doing uh it it's so much more interesting i thought than um uh sitting and watching it on TV i think it's kind of boring yeah
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah so you've been in the gallery before
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh on the Byron Nelson Classics um was it no it wasn't last year it was the year before
 	
 	
 		so who'd you follow
 	
 	
 		uh gosh i can't even remember you know all those names kind of go together  after a while
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		was it like a big name with a big gallery or was it one of the younger pros or something
 	
 	
 		um let me see because i followed several
 		and i'm trying to think who it is that i was um going along with i don't remember now
 		i mean gee whiz i all i remember was we had tornadoes about the same time and that was the big highlight they were afraid they were going to go down through the center of the the the golf course and that's what i remember the most about that uh but i do remember thinking it was a lot different to be out there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh watching than it was to watch it on TV uh watching than it was to watch it on TV
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah you're outdoors and you know it's kind of neat that's the only thing that's what draws me to golf is just you know being outside on a large wide open space pretty much
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh well down here it's so expensive i'm from Indiana and up there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i went to Purdue and you have Purdue golf course and if you're a student i mean you can play eighteen holes for like seven bucks
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		on a really you know it's a big ten championship course so it's really well kept and everything else but you know down here it's it's incredible i've
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've never golfed down here because it's you know nine holes for ten bucks or something and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and by the time i i drill a you know a half dozen balls into a pond or something you know that's that's an extra five bucks right there and so
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it gets kind of expensive for the young college graduate
 	
 	
 		sure sure well i know uh
 		uh  since it's warmer weather down here and you can
 		play almost year round then yeah that's the reason is there's so many people who want to get out and go play golf
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		see my parents live in Ohio and my dad what he'll do is uh he will come down here or go someplace else in the South to where it's warm so he can continue playing golf i mean this is what an avid golf person does
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it is just so fascinating and then everything we get for him is all golf junk you know the golf hat the golf you know clock everything because he's he's just he is he is a freak when it comes to golfing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		golf clock
 		has a subscription to Golf Magazine or something
 	
 	
 		yeah he uh he's he's really something
 	
 	
 		that's funny
 		yeah so uh has he always been like that or just in the later years
 	
 	
 		no see he um it's only been in about the past five years
 		and he's so good we keep telling him he needs to get into some of those senior tournaments and he says oh i can't get in there with Arnold Palmer and all those other good people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i'm saying yes you could you know and then that's where you usually can make a little money and and profit this way uh because his handicap has gotten lower and lower and lower every single year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh but no he hasn't gone to do that yet but we wish he would you know make a little mega bucks and pass it along you know to the family
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well if nothing else just get out there and rub shoulders with the boys
 	
 	
 		that's right i know get to meet all these stars because i remember sitting on his lap when i was a little girl watching golf he has loved golf really all of his life and but i remember watching it golf with him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so yeah this is something that uh he can go and see all these people he's uh got to watch on TV for years and years and y ears and years so
 	
 	
 		well that's neat
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so too
 	
 	
 		so uh you don't see you uh
 		taking up you know and charging being the avid golfer in the near future huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i think some of my brothers are going to do that i'm a volleyball person myself yeah yeah i love volleyball so i'm on a TI league
 	
 	
 		oh volleyball
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh play with a group of people from here at work but i don't even think TI has well they may have a golfing
 		i don't know they may have a golfing club you know it's possible
 	
 	
 		i've never really well Sherman's a smaller plant but i've never really seen
 		a golf club but  okay i've seen a golf club that's funny but uh golfing club uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		golfing club yeah there you go  i bet you they do but i just
 		you know i hear about things like the tennis the tennis um teams and and uh volleyball and baseball but i haven't heard of golf but i'm sure they probably do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well i don't know there just not that many places to play around here from what i hear there's a private club maybe one and there's uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the local junior college has a golf course because it used to be an Air Force base so they've got the old Air Force base golf course and it's like
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		playing on dirt i mean there's no grass so uh you know it's not too many golfers like there are in Dallas probably
 	
 	
 		oh no uh-huh
 		uh um-hum
 	
 	
 		with more courses and more people and probably higher money better kept
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but
 		i don't know i'm i'm just kind of glad my wife's kind of in to it she's she'll play in it about once or twice a year but that's about it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah me too it's not uh not something like uh that obsession i think my father has
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well if it's genetic you'd better be careful
 	
 	
 		i know that's true  well it was nice talking with you
 	
 	
 		likewise and uh maybe we'll get hooked up again sometime all right take care bye
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay take care bye-bye
