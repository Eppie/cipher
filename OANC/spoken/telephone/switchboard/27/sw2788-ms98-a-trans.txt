 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what kind of  do you have children
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah we have one that's seventeen one that's fifteen and one that's just now six
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and we had kind of a hard time finding someplace that would
 		we could put Michael's because his birthday is the first of September and he was going to school at five
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so he started the first grade when he was five or started
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah first grade when he was five years old
 	
 	
 		and you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five
 	
 	
 		yeah so we could you know we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it was
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that
 	
 	
 		mediocore mediocre expensive it wasn't really that expensive but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		to learn something and that's i mean that's  even not only toddlers but you know even your older children
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's hard to find anywhere there really going to learn something and then yeah you do have to pay you know if you the better the place the more you're going to pay
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		yeah but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway
 	
 	
 		true very true if
 	
 	
 		you know my
 		my wife works so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the babysitter so
 	
 	
 		um-hum if i had any children i would uh i hope that i'll be in a position to stay home with my child because
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i'm not real uh
 		uh trusting  of a lot of people
 	
 	
 		yeah see i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh especially today people i work in the news business and i just see different things all the time
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and people are just crazy these days they're crazy
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		and  and i don't you know it takes me a takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend much less to you know trust someone with my with my child
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well see we took our time and we checked it out and we found a preschool for him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it you know through other
 		folks where i where i work i work at TI
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so through other folks where we worked we
 		found a nice preschool it was actually at a licensed preschool you know we
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		had those requirements
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i guess that's the best way you know to get recommendations from your friends or family members
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you know i well that and
 		you know i don't think i would have left him anywhere that would i would have stayed home with him first
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		before i left him somewhere that you know they still have unlicensed babysitters running around up here and
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you know i just i i don't think i'd take that chance
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i think it's out of sight or out of mind for less than
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i mean you have to be you have to be sure that these people
 	
 	
 		for more than a minute or so
 	
 	
 		i mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything but you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them you know that they wouldn't let them drink something or
 	
 	
 		but you never know
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know eat something off the floor you know just simple things that can be harmful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but you you know
 		as far as brittle as child abuse is these days you never know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you don't know who you can trust and who you can't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and you hear so much you know on the news about
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		uh child care places and also um senior care facilities you know and you hear abuse yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah senior care is getting real bad
 	
 	
 		and so you just you just don't know and you almost want to you know spend a couple of weeks with in class with your child just to see how it is or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		so you have no children at all huh
 	
 	
 		no i don't
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		gee
 	
 	
 		no
 		i'm
 	
 	
 		do you miss that part in your life or
 	
 	
 		uh no i'm only i'm twenty three
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i still have a little bit of time
 		um it's just not in the cards for me right now i'm trying to get my career going
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i imagine yeah working in the news production anyway back to the subject
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we should have discussed this earlier but anyway it's tough it really is it's hard to find
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		good child care and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's going to be fine all day long
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		and you brought up a good point you know about learning you just don't want a babysitter you you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their ABC's or something you know get them
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah you know and he's he's doing real well it it it has paid off for him he's in first grade now and he's you know got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so you know those early ages when he would you know when his mom and dad are at work and he's actually in child care in a preschool not
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just child care you know we could have sent him to anybody you know there's a lot people at work that would have babysat him but
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us his his attitude is i think a little bit
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		tall for a six year old and
 		you know but his
 	
 	
 		did you take this same uh route with your other two children
 	
 	
 		um they they were outside my marriage so
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i would say no but
 	
 	
 		i was wondering how
 	
 	
 		you know all my children excel they're they're really good and i guess no he learns from the older boys too but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right
 		and it helps that he has older brothers you know um just to have role models and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah seeing like uh in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all boys but in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have
 		another woman in the house for my wife to share but
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we faced that too but
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		he learns quite a bit he learned quite a bit from
 		not only from nursery school but he learned quite a bit from the older boys and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know he's excelled and it's paying off for him it really is he's
 	
 	
 		that's excellent
 	
 	
 		he is pretty smart sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed but he is smart you know yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well what kid isn't
 		these days so
 	
 	
 		but
 		i think it's important i think it's really nice to know that you can
 		find someplace i don't know you know how it is down there in Waco but in Lubbock we have a few that you can
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		send your children to and they can actually learn something instead of just being babysat
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do they have any kind of program like at TI or wherever your wife works
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		um some any kind of day care
 	
 	
 		no not any
 		huh-uh
 		we just
 	
 	
 		hum because i know they're they're putting that into a lot of uh corporations now
 	
 	
 		yeah they're trying to the federal government is trying to insist on that too so
 	
 	
 		right
 		so maybe that'll be an option for
 	
 	
 		no we don't yet
 		well it would be nice
 		you know there
 	
 	
 		but then i i foresee that being just a babysitting
 		thing not much learning but
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah there's not well
 	
 	
 		kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work
 	
 	
 		you know where where we sent Michael the first few years was there was different teachers all the time you know some
 		girls were there in the morning and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day
 	
 	
 		hum
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and then he they had a group of kids and they put on skits and they put on plays and they did the Halloween thing and the Valentine's Day things
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's you know it was important to us so we you know we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way
 	
 	
 		hum
 		do you think it would have been better for him to have um
 		maybe one continuous teacher somebody to that he could
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh get attached to or is it better the other way with a lot of different
 	
 	
 		no because i think
 		you know as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't think he needed to be attached to too even though he did
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know he attached himself to a couple of those but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think his attachments at home and you know he gets the idea of what school is for and uh you know i have different teachers here and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach teach me another and
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		no so i i i really can't say that it would be it's important for him to attach himself to anybody
 	
 	
 		right um um-hum
 	
 	
 		he did well you it it with another child i can't say that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because i don't have that experience
 	
 	
 		yeah each child is individual as for as learning and things
 	
 	
 		yeah see
 		but i don't have that experience so i can't say that you know he did well so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't think we made too many mistakes
 	
 	
 		right well it sounds good sounds like he's doing real well
 	
 	
 		we tried hard
 		yeah he's doing real well
 	
 	
 		um-hum well good
 	
 	
 		and he learned from it so and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be babysat all day
 		you know babysat sounds to me like
 		well you're here i guess i'll watch you when i get time you know maybe i'll clean my house maybe i'll cook you lunch maybe i won't
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and
 	
 	
 		and they'll probably sit him in front of the television
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know while they do other things yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and i don't you know i don't allow that when he's at home so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		we had a good experience and we really did well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good that's good
 	
 	
 		so and he didn't
 		he served
 		better than we did you know he gained he actually gained from it you know sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		continue our family but i think in the long run he gained from it just
 		being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching TV and playing all day
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and its important
 	
 	
 		that's probably what i'll try and look for whenever i do have my children i don't know when that will be but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know just really look into it will it will take me a long time to find somewhere i'm sure
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		just because i i just want to be i want to be so positive that you know my children are okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as well as the other children in the center you know
 	
 	
 		well you know his his mom didn't go back to work till
 		you know he was six months old
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we just didn't want to dump him somewhere and make him feel like he wasn't wanted
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and we wanted his center of attention at home but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we did what we could and it it worked out real well i'm glad we were so careful
 	
 	
 		it's difficulties but it's it's a lot more difficulties these days because you have both parents working a lot of times and so you have to find day care whereas you know here
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you know
 		well it
 		most of the time now it's a necessity you can't afford
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 		you know i'm not making seventy or thirty eighty thousand dollars a year so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		it's pretty tough
 	
 	
 		so child care's a necessity whereas years ago you know the husband basically worked and the wife basically stayed home
 	
 	
 		yeah and mom  mom was allowed to stay home and there was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a few families outside of that where dad stayed home and mom worked but not very many that i know of when i was growing up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know i'm forty now but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i know when i was a kid mom was always at home
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so we didn't
 	
 	
 		i think that has a lot to do with just just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is is breaking
 		you know the basic family is not there anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah it is yeah it is i'll agree with that it is it's it's not there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i think that plays a big part in in a child's learning and you know what they can and cannot do in child care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i would think
