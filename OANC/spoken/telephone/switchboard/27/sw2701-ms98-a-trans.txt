 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		anyway so what have what have you been into did you watch LA Law last night
 	
 	
 		uh no actually i i don't i i don't uh it's funny i don't really seem to watch a lot of television what um i usually like to pick up on TV are some of the
 		news type of shows like you know 20/20 60 Minutes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um unfortunately a  couple of weekly soaps like Knots Landing and uh Dallas we watch
 		and uh and i usually uh i just other than those i i catch movies once in a while i like a lot of the movies that are you know true stories true to life that type of thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um but i'm not i'm not real big on that much on television uh i don't have really many favorite shows that i i must see every week you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh part of that i think is uh i have two boys and you know usually i don't get to sit down to watch the
 	
 	
 		they they they get first crack huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so uh anyway um
 		but how about you then
 	
 	
 		well i usually i guess a lot of the sitcoms
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Cosby Cheers uh
 	
 	
 		well i find i do sit down with them when they have those those they like a lot of those uh shows and often when they have them on
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's when they're quiet i like sit sit down with them and watch it yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah A different A Different World
 		a Different World
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but some of the other ones like i've been getting into L A Law and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you watch uh Thirty Something
 	
 	
 		no i don't make a point i i guess i really never make a point to to watch anything i'll just end up catching it but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so you catch whatever might be on if you're interested that evening
 	
 	
 		yeah you know if i'm not doing that night uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know which i guess is usually most nights no
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		oh speaking of 20/20 you didn't see the one in with the exorcists exorcists
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i you know i wanted to and i forget i really i kept seeing it advertised and i wanted to see that and i don't know we might not have been home or something  excuse me and
 		i didn't see that but i was really interested in in that i i found that a pretty interesting story that they said the church recognized that as as a real exorcism
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh did you see that show
 	
 	
 		yeah i did
 	
 	
 		and what what did you think what did they what uh was that all about
 	
 	
 		oh well the girl that supposedly was possessed uh had actually uh you know seen uh you know something uh some medical the medical  side i don't know if it was a psychologist or what all but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know it was interesting interesting it's interesting uh and uh
 		you know i'm from you know i'm was raised Catholic fairly you know fairly fairly strong with my mom and dad so
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband is too
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it you know that's kind of interesting um but the bottom line it you know they did the exorcism it wasn't real major you know she she was fairly you know she you know obviously there she you know she something was wrong with her
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh it wasn't really uh
 		you know extraordinary as far as her actions
 		and she had done that and she felt like that helped her
 		but at the same time shortly after that exorcism they also started um
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um uh giving her medication for like a split personality type stuff of
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so uh she's doing better but and and the girl herself you know believes that it you know that she was uh
 		you know possessed but and you know it it's hard to say
 	
 	
 		hum
 		it could be a multiple like one of these multiple personality disorders
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm not i'm not sure you know who knows but uh anyway it wasn't uh
 	
 	
 		also
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you know it was uh
 		it was you know
 	
 	
 		it wasn't as dramatic as i guess maybe they made it seem
 	
 	
 		well i i can't say it wasn't just because of the fact that that it's pretty
 		unusual for something like that to be nationally televised uh or or have anybody come in you know who who would want to have that televised you know if that was happening to your daughter
 	
 	
 		right
 		and well
 		right
 		right and also
 	
 	
 		and her parents are right there you know doing it all you know  so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um and also for the church to recognize it as a a true exorcism you know um usually they're such i think i really think that there's a fine line between what um
 		you know a lot of people think is possessed and what are really mental disorders you know and maybe in the old days you know many years ago what they often said oh people were possessed we probably recognize now as schizophrenia or something
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and uh you know it's it's it's hard to to say you know whether
 		it's it's just a it's a mental disorder or it's really uh uh it's a or if it's a split personality or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wait honey i can't talk right now  uh but um what i don't know now what area are you living  in
 	
 	
 		i'm in Phoenix Arizona right now
 	
 	
 		oh  wait Jackie what
 		yes okay okay go    excuse me so
 	
 	
 		are you in Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh no we are uh outside of Washington DC
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and i was just the reason i asked that i was curious i thought maybe in different parts of uh you know the country maybe there were certain shows that were more more popular than in other parts
 		and i know in this area it's i don't know DC is especially the newer areas are really known for having so many yuppies you know and a lot of them are into Thirty Something and you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know some of the other shows they watch um Twin Peaks  you know and i'm not really into those shows and that really surprises people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i never got caught up in Twin Twin Peaks either so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and i just i was just wondering demographically if you know if different parts if there were shows that were more popular than in other areas i don't know like where you live um you know what are the real
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what are the hot shows you know that everybody seems to want to watch
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know i don't hear people talk at work you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as far as uh
 		you know what what people are getting into but
 		um
 		you know some of the top sitcoms obviously do you know always in the top five you know
 		the Cosby or i think A Different World is real strong and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		now that's funny see i haven't even heard of that show that's just
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's the one it's the one right after Cosby and it's produced by Co sby and it's about it's basically about uh college
 	
 	
 		oh is that right so
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		you know and it it obvious it's you know since since it's kind of promoted by Cosby it's you know mostly blacks
 	
 	
 		i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh but it's it's a pretty good show it uh
 	
 	
 		and are all the kids into the Simpsons
 	
 	
 		have you ever heard of Jasmine Guy
 	
 	
 		pardon me uh yes
 	
 	
 		okay now she's one of the main stars of that and now she's just come out came out with an album
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh and which is fairly successful she's got one or two singles that have done very well so
 		but she is a very strong personality in that show uh and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i see
 	
 	
 		it's your basic college and what people run into and they in fact they just had a show covering AIDS
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		so you know they try to get their messages across i should say
 	
 	
 		yeah now there's a new show on and i can't think of the name of it apparently the producer of it was a
 		Potomac resident um you know which is right right around here close to where we we are living you know the Potomac
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		area outside of DC and and i i think he went to like Wooton High School here or something and and some of the papers that circulating the rumor  that
 		this show is based upon stories that actually happened at Wooton High where he went and that's and he she denies some of it you know um i oh
 		eh eh i eh it might be the Beverly Hills um there's that one called Beverly Hills one O two one O or something like that uh
 	
 	
 		um not sure
 	
 	
 		and uh that's becoming a little popular and of course the kids all like the Simpsons here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i guess it's the same there also
 	
 	
 		yeah uh that one is is it still competing with Cosby
 	
 	
 		um i'm not sure i don't know what's happened uh i know a lot of some of the parents won't let their kids watch it  you know uh
 	
 	
 		such a brat
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah but um it what what uh
 		what changes would you like to see i mean in in in you know evening television do you think there should be more like news type programs like 20/20 or more comedies or weeklies
 	
 	
 		honestly i'm indifferent
 		i probably i probably will watch a little bit of everything uh i i i i get into movies i'll uh i'll see you know i'll watch 20/20 or i'll
 	
 	
 		you're indifferent it doesn't matter
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh you know i guess i'm only mostly into sitcoms i guess my favorite you know one show i'm really into is Arsenio Hall
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh yeah i watch that uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and then you know i've been watching him for a long time now and i i needed a break and i watched Johnny Carson last night a little more level you know  and so it's like i'm just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		think oh what do i feel like today you know we're getting option our options on different talk shows and i always liked watching Letterman but he starts so late
 	
 	
 		you so you like some of these late shows
 	
 	
 		yeah well the the talk shows with the personality yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah talk shows yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh Letterman starts pretty late out here about twelve o'clock
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right oh oh okay
 	
 	
 		but i'll still watch it once in a while
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah um i guess so i think also probably because people now there are so many
 		uh  everybody has VCR's and rents so many movies that might have i don't know that might have hurt some of the the popularity of certain shows you know a lot of things that they put on Saturday nights a lot of people
 	
 	
 		yeah
