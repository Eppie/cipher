 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what what kind of car did you just buy a car or are you in the market to buy a car or
 	
 	
 		actually i'm real close to being in the market to buy a car i've got uh a couple older cars they're both over ten years old
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they've served me well
 		but i kind of would like to get a more uh gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i've got three children at home two  fourteen year olds and a twelve year old
 		and so i need to make sure i've got one that i can fit
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all five of us into and if you if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i i seem to remember when i was young that was a problem
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but no no car was big enough for that
 	
 	
 		well uh i've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh now i know that that uh they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years
 		but uh i like the Dodge products
 		and uh been uh couple times i've had a opportunity to rent one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i've been really pleased with its performance and with the size
 		and because if you get the seven passenger version  you can put some space between the kids
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh i think that would that would serve us well plus it's got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store
 	
 	
 		um-hum which is the one that has modular type seats you know which one i'm talking about they have the commercial on TV where you can you can pull some seats out and you can move around
 	
 	
 		um-hum exactly correct
 		yeah if you want
 	
 	
 		is that is that the Dodge Caravan that does that or
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah it uh the Dodge Caravans will do that
 		uh you can take the uh uh usually there's a uh a double seat behind the uh front buckets
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then if you get the and then there's a three seat that goes or three person seat that goes in the back now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out
 		and just have the three seats in the back and the two seats up front or you can take the uh three seat out and just use the two seat or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's very versatile you can move the seats all around that's the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat and move it forward
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		well the one that i can't remember one it is but it's the
 		if it's the Toyota or
 		or one of the other ones i don't know if it's one of the Americans or the import ones where uh they actually have like um
 		some bucket seats in the back but you can actually pull them out i mean they're really easy to pull out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and you can uh move them around and stuff and it it to me
 		that that would be real good for us uh my husband and i uh like to go camping and stuff and right now we have a van which is it's an older van and we're we're thinking about buying another sedan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um probably next year
 		um right now motorcycles is takes precedence since that that's what my husband really wants right now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh next year we'll probably buy a new car and we're looking at uh possibly the Honda Accord
 		um
 		that's kind of uh
 		as far as far as the interior it's got the luxury interior but doesn't it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have
 		which is one of the things that we were looking at you know finding something that's that's fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i think that's getting to be kind of important now that uh you know the price is becoming
 		the driving factor and then you look at once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at at what you can buy with it where before i think you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you looked at the car you wanted and then you looked to see how well you could afford it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		or how you could afford it
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think it's going to be a lot easier now i just heard that they  lowered the prime lending rate
 		so i think it's going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think banks are going to be a lot more a little bit more lenient
 	
 	
 		yeah i know they're trying to do everything they can to uh end the recession
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and dropping the prime is probably one of the things i just bought a new house so
 		i got a a uh nine and a half percent interest rate
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		not sure i could do much better today
 		but uh that is also effecting buying a new car
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i can imagine you got to kind of work work that into your budget that balance that and the house payment and of course uh is if you buy a new car you're going to are any of your kids driving age yet
 	
 	
 		well that and there
 		uh two fourteen year olds will be uh fifteen on the fourth of July
 		so
 	
 	
 		are so are they twins
 	
 	
 		yeah they're twins born on the bicentennial
 		you're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial is our motto July fourth seventy six
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh uh i've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be
 		behind the wheel of a car so America's safe for another fifteen month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh after that
 		now i may keep the uh one or both of the two cars i i currently have for them to drive you know they're they're
 		they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that i feel safe feel safe that if they were in an accident they would survive
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know what i mean it i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the Honda
 		they're just
 	
 	
 		well the the Honda's have been have been very safe in in accidents uh more so than a lot of the American cars as a matter of fact i just heard something today on on the news about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		those uh automatic seat belts that are attached to the door um they're questioning the safety of those now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		saying that and they showed uh a simulation where there were they had a dummy in the car and the door opened and the dummy actually fell out of the car and the car rolled out on top of him
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		so they're saying they're not as safe as they give the appearance of being safe but they're really not as safe as they as they uh appear to be
 		so um
 		i'm kind of concerned about that as far as you know what the seat belts
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know if Marylan d has a uh a seat belt law but they do have one in Texas and you're you're required to wear them
 	
 	
 		yes definitely
 		the thing is that they're i think it's a two part seat belt though there's the uh door belt and then there's one a lap belt
 	
 	
 		exactly but
 		ninety uh probably about well i don't know about ninety but probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it
 		i know my brother doesn 't and he has one in his car
 	
 	
 		then make sure you smack him around then
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i mean it it kind of gives you a false sense of security you think oh i've got one portion of my seat belt on
 		um but if your door comes open
 		you know it's not going to do you any good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that that that's a concern of mine as far as uh what i'll be looking at with with buying a new car um
 		i'm not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door i think i would feel better with them attached to the actual car the inside where they're normally attached to like behind the door
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah the uh the supports
 		um a good source of information i've found has always been these uh used car manuals
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because you can flip through the used car manuals and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and you can look at the uh the track record on a car over the year and you usually notice uh a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out to where there's fewer problems and you get an idea on how well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		the the next car's going to be now as long as they aren't changing the model you know like when the uh Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems with the smaller car as long as they aren't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah the the Le Mans is like that too uh we used to have a Le Mans when i was in in high school
 		um and it was a big car i mean it was like the uh the Grand Prix
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in i think around nineteen eighty um
 		they changed the model and it like went went to half the size
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 	
 	
 		literally i mean it got chopped in half and it wasn't even the same car anymore didn't even remotely resemble the old car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i remember when that happened so unless they're really changing the model
 		um
 		yeah chances are that it's probably going to have the the fewer mistakes than it had the year before
 	
 	
 		yeah well everybody that i've talked to who's ever had a Honda loves them and my husband had a Honda
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and it was a lease car and he had to turn back in uh a year and a half ago
 		uh and he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it and it was great
 		um and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because
 		we didn't feel the at at the time the residual was like sixty five hundred dollars and it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um a four year old car
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		so
 		so we ended up just went just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and and got out of the lease
 		um
 		one thing that i that i am curious about is um reading information on air bags do some of the vans i think i don't know about the Dodge Caravan but some of the vans now now have um driver side air bags
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which i think is a good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah
