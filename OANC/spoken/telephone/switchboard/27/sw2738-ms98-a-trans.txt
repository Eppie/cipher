 
     		
 	
 		have you run into any problems with invasion of privacy there
 	
 	
 		well what i consider invasion well maybe it's just invasion of my private time is i we get a lot of those computer generated uh telephone calls
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		where they just you know go through the list and whenever you pick up the phone it's a recording and there you're supposed to hold on for a very important phone call and i feel that if it was so important that they would uh be there instead of putting me on hold
 	
 	
 		oh well that explains that i got one the other day they they did that uh it was a very important phone call from somewhere and they put me on a dead line for
 		oh it must have been minutes and i said well it couldn't have been that important and i wound up hanging up and i've always wondered what that was
 	
 	
 		yeah we uh i don't know why it is but there have been so many of those that um instead of the the sales usual sales calls that you get that they um
 		will just run through the list and i guess wait for someone who's going to hang on to talk to them but uh yeah then we get a lot of those
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		almost sort of like these TI phone calls no  right right no these these are beneficial too too uh for personal uh benefit here so
 	
 	
 		yeah you you don't mind them
 		no most of the people that are looking for me will try to get a hold of me at work that's about the only place they can pin me down
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so about any important phone call that i have i'm going to get it at work and if the phone call comes to the house chances are it's either for my wife or one of the girls
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i just do not answer the phone call you know i'll let it ring until somebody else answers it and if they say dad it's for you
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i says what are they selling  and i'd say ninety percent of the time if the calls for me at home it's somebody who wants to sell me some oil leases or some
 	
 	
 		right right
 		swamp land in Florida
 	
 	
 		some uh grave sites or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah we get a lot for uh aluminum siding
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh but yeah what do you all have what do you consider your invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		i consider that to be the invasion of privacy particularly when i'm sitting down at the dinner table and they give me a call and i i have to answer this phone to find out they're trying to sell me something and my dinner's getting cold
 	
 	
 		right right that seems to be the prime time they call is is definitely well between uh six and eight o'clock i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think for metropolitan areas they realize that most people work and that that probably the majority of people both husband and wife work and so there's nobody home except maybe school kids after school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so they might as well not even try you know not even tie up people dialing phone numbers except in the evening
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		fortunately they have uh sufficient respect that they don't call after ten o'clock and they don't call before eight o'clock in the morning
 	
 	
 		right i'm surprised they don't though  uh i but i'm sure if they did that uh there would be a lot more uh
 		public uh uh voice about it that uh we wouldn't go for that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think if i got a phone call at six o'clock in the morning it was somebody trying to sell me something i would call the phone company immediately and list them as a nuisance call
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right and what's so bad about it is um and they don't i mean all it is is they just go through down a list of numbers i mean they don't know who they're calling it didn't seem like uh it they're just a haphazard um
 		uh at it so i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i think that's about the biggest invasion of privacy we have uh there are a few others but uh i presume that they have legitimate purposes
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		yeah the government seems to intervene quite a bit uh one of the other complaints i have is uh have you ever checked your credit with the credit bureau
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh no not yet
 	
 	
 		you ought to do that it's interesting that to see who has inquired about your uh finances because uh they're required to keep track and for i think about the preceding year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's interesting to see who has uh called and inquire about your credit and there's quite a few companies that uh want to send you credit cards or uh charge cards you know will ask for a uh credit dump and then
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		send you a letter trying to get you to take their credit card open a charge account with some company
 	
 	
 		that
 		now we've gotten several of those letters as far as trying to um sign us up for you know like you you've been uh approved for a pre you know for a credit card and all this and uh i've always wondered how
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh why now we had a problem not too long ago our
 		uh my brother-in-law recently moved and uh somehow or another we we got their new address on our credit reports because the uh
 		i guess the credit card companies or whatever sort of keep up on some of them and uh had uh picked up the new address and was sending all our bills over there
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so it was like okay now wait a second here so it'll be interesting to see how that works out how messed up things will be
 	
 	
 		yeah that takes some paperwork to get straightened out
 	
 	
 		yup so that was a mess
 		but uh yeah it the credit there was a report not too long ago on the news here on uh
 		they were going about how easily it was to get information about anyone and uh you know they got a credit history um you know went through all the moves that they made you know their uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was just amazing the stuff that they got and it was so easily you know it was all public uh information it seemed like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well there are uh lists that go by zip codes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh a lot of companies will target people for specific zip codes because of uh you know if you live in the Elton region or Great Falls area of Fairfax County or Montgomery County in Maryland
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh you're a prime candidate to be living in a rich house and uh spend money on foolish things so uh that gets you on a mailing list for Jaguars and Rolls Royces and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah we're in one of those counties and uh it uh you get lots of interesting things in the mail in Fort Bend County in southwest Houston the it seems to be the the up grown you know the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the uh new generation or whatever the up and coming people are all are moving out this direction and uh the new it's funny to see how the different stores are now changing uh to the um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		new demands and uh or trying to get the different uh people in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so uh but yeah i do you know you brought a good point about the um credit histories the credit reports that uh i feel is an can be an invasion of privacy if it's used wrong
 	
 	
 		um-hum  well there was something on the news just this morning that uh somebody in doing their
 	
 	
 		and uh should be so
 	
 	
 		uh Master's dissertation or something of that nature uh did a study
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of uh credit card reports or or credit reports and they found that something like twenty percent of them have erroneous data in there
 		uh data that would prevent that person from getting a loan in the future or or getting a credit advance and uh the information was erroneous
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so uh i i think everybody recommends that uh well they've they the uh story this morning on this radio suggested you ought to do this about once a year but i figure about once every five years is good enough
 	
 	
 		that's right because isn't it uh about fifty dollars to get one oh is it oh okay i was thinking uh maybe i got some wrong information somewhere
 	
 	
 		uh it's about five dollars yeah it's fairly cheap
 		yeah well i had it done just to make sure that there wasn't any wrong information in there everything seemed to be all right
 	
 	
 		right
 		but it it's difficult to change those or or easily to correct though oh
 	
 	
 		well apparent apparently not not if you uh approach the people and and they're they're interested in keeping their records accurate
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh it's just nice to make sure that no uh
 		uh strange records show up
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		there was one case i think here recently where some fellow down in Southwestern Virginia uh wound up being arrested for uh failure to provide child support
 		and he didn't have any children and he had a heck of a time convincing the authorities that he wasn't the the party that was responsible for failing to make child support payments
 	
 	
 		oh  i bet his wife was like okay come on what are you not telling me here  right the second life here oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh well i enjoyed talking to you and uh uh you i guess have a nice day thank you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		all righty
 		thank you bye
