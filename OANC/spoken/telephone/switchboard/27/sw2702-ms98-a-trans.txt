 
     		
 	
 		well as much as i'd uh i'd like to say that i'll be looking for a flashy convertible or a or a four by four or something i guess the next car i'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door
 	
 	
 		what kind of car do you have now
 	
 	
 		oh we've got a uh an older Delta Eighty Eight and then uh our our newer car is a uh a Corsica and uh we'll probably be looking for something about that uh that same style that same kind of four door hard top style and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		you got kids
 	
 	
 		uh no but we're planning for it so uh in fact uh our Oldsmobile is a is a like an old Delta Eighty Eight but it's in pretty good shape it's in really good shape and we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles that's probably where the first place we'd look
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well we've always had uh Fords uh mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that'll do it
 	
 	
 		yeah that'll do it um but yeah we're we're in the same shape i think our next car will be a you know some big old four door  uh
 		something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons and  we've got a minivan
 	
 	
 		yep
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's great
 		and i drive i drive uh well i used to drive an Escort but it died on me so i  i mean i i i used to run it i uh where we used to live i used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		and uh and this Escort took it all and its it it got up to uh uh i was at ninety four thousand miles on it and the engine just went
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i i bought i bought a used um Dodge Aries
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which has been okay i i mean i haven't had it that long but  it it'll it's an eighty five Aries but it only had thirty four thousand miles on it when i bought it
 	
 	
 		really
 		um-hum
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		and i just you know i just drive it to work so it's just a ten minute commute everyday
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um it doesn't get much of uh i mean  it's not like i'm putting it through its paces  but i think uh and it's a four door which is nice but it's still a little cramped i've got three kids
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah sounds like you you need at least like a Taurus size or something like that
 	
 	
 		so i i
 		yeah that's what i was thinking of was a Taurus um
 	
 	
 		yeah i i know i know a lot of the guys at work they uh the ones that have uh families uh and they still want kind of a sports car they've been uh a lot of them been getting these uh Taurus SHOs
 		that i guess it's the sport version of the Taurus in fact it comes with a standard stick and uh
 	
 	
 		oh really  yeah
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and a lot of those it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and usually they're in like black and gun metal grey and and those kind of colors you're not gonna see too many uh you know green ones or blue ones or anything like that they they put them in sporty colors i guess but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah well my wife wants a Miata
 	
 	
 		oh well sure  that's what you know until till you look at the price tag and then you go what what would i really besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun what would i really do with this car if it what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		right yeah
 		i know i know it's like i i guess i could fit in it  maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i went i went through that when i first got out of uh college i had an old car that i bought just to get to to my job my first job
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and when i got there the first thing i did was trade it in on a Spitfire and i i knew that was gonna be the only time i could afford a two seater uh sports car
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that that just does not make it as an only car it's uh it's like i bought i would i bought a set of stereo speakers
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was one of those cash and carry deals and i had to take them one at a time with the top down
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it was winter so i was like in this coat with the top down and the speaker in the passenger seat
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i drove that one home and then i went back and got the other one and put that in the passenger seat and drove that one home
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh funny funniest sight and  you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i you know it's funny most people that i've talked to
 		did stuff like that when they were in college or you know  or when they were single anyway they'd they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last i never did that uh you know my first car was a Toyota Corolla
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh because i got a good deal on it and uh that was a great little car actually
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i met that's how i met girls
 		was i'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission which i i'd never i i'd learned on an automatic transmission and so so i'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		boy that's a good deal
 	
 	
 		and uh in fact i married one of those people and it worked yeah it worked all right real good
 	
 	
 		ah okay well i'll have to remember that if i ever get in that situation again
 		huh because i i know we've uh that's that's something that that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission my um my wife just does can't can't
 		can't uh  she doesn't really wanna learn i guess the uh the standard shift in fact i i remember once we uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we uh went uh went on a uh test drive we got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said you know i'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a car and we went uh we went uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we went to a dealership and uh
 		it it was it was pretty she she did pretty well but it was one of these things where we just went to a big parking lot and the uh dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking because that's all it was it was it was the funniest thing it was like a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a big Le Baron it was a Le Baron with everything on it but it had a standard shift it was the craziest thing i ever saw and and and that's probably why they were trying to sell them i guess
 	
 	
 		wow
 		that's weird
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth she did pretty well after a while but uh it's it's kind of hard to learn i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well my wife i mean she'd always driven standard transmission and uh and and in fact all our earlier cars were standard a standard transmission in fact the minivan's a has a stick shift
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and in fact this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything you know it's got
 		automatic transmission cruise control you know electric locks you know it's like it's like a luxury car except that it's the Dodge Aries you know so uh
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 		yeah yeah
 		what the oh well
 		well i guess that i guess that's about all i got to say about cars
 	
 	
 		well  um
 		the the thing about this uh the i will say this about the minivan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we thought that was a luxury car when we bought it it it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i would think so yeah because it's so big
 	
 	
 		yeah and and it was quiet it had a stereo system we never had it you know we always had the AM radio  and uh course this had stick shift it had speakers speakers that you can control from the backseat
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		sure sure
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you can change the channels on the on the radio from the backseat too and put speaker speaker phones in it so uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		now now now that used to be a luxury but i bet on the next time you buy a car that's gonna be mandatory  you've got to have that now you're used to it and you got to have it
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right that's right
 		and you got to pay for it too and i bet and i bet it costs twice as much as as when i bought mine
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true too
 		it  probably does it probably does
 		but uh
 		oh well well Bill it's been nice talking to you okay you have a good evening um-hum bye-bye
 	
 	
 		well
 		nice talking to you
 		thanks a lot bye bye
