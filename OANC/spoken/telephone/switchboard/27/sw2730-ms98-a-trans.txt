 
     		
 	
 		okay well do you have any formal programs in your area
 	
 	
 		sure i used to cycle around the block two or
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i recycled once before no yes actually we do we have Berkeley is a very avant-garde recycling city
 	
 	
 		somehow that doesn't surprise me
 	
 	
 		yeah they they go around and they give you these boxes and you you fill these boxes up and you take them out and they leave you know
 		uh you leave them on the curbstone and every Thursday or some such day they come by and pick them up problem is you end up with these boxes in your home that
 		you know get pretty piled up with such things as glass and tin cans and newspapers and and and by the time you you manage to drag one downstairs you know it's
 		it's work i i i just the the there there's got to be a better way of incorporating it you know somehow so that the manufacturers uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh that there's an incentive to get it back to them
 	
 	
 		yeah what i i don't know we we there are some beginnings of formal programs where we are though they're not in our town i mean Jackie and i uh recycle cans you know we just we just
 		fill up a we have a trash can set aside for aluminium cans and when it gets full we just take it down and drop it off at the recycling center but that's about the extent of ours
 		uh i don't it seems to me like if if they really wanted to get serious or you know the government and uh the other private industries that could benefit from it would make uh perhaps more permanent
 		uh exterior fixtures which you know wouldn't be hassle to drive to or carry stuff to you know that that's kind of one of the thoughts that i had about it
 	
 	
 		exactly you know what what they uh oh another thing is that it the industry has got to get the mind set that what they'd do affects the universe you know the affects the environment
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what they manufacture has got to be and the way it's packaged has got to take that into consideration
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but like here in Berkeley you can't buy anything from a fast-food place anything like that that's in styrofoam
 	
 	
 		yeah they've switched to that paperboard the pressboard stuff
 	
 	
 		uh and you know it's it's supposedly decomposes i've heard some stories though about
 		that uh the thing that that lasts longest in in in a in a the the uh landfills
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is not so much the diapers and the things that everyone's yelling about but it's the newspapers
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's really strange you wouldn't think that but whenever you see you know they're usually uh wrapped real tight and bundled and under pressure themselves before they get put into the landfill so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		inner areas of them are are protected
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so they don't decompose
 	
 	
 		isn't that something
 	
 	
 		isn't that you know you
 		and all those thousands of trees that gets cut down and you think well geez well newspaper's pretty good because it will you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw a sign at the local Wal-Mart here back there in the baby section talking about Wal-Mart does not buy disposable diapers
 		because they don't decompose as rapidly as people say they do so they just buy the ones that don't decompose at all  i thought that was interesting
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		indeed well you know there's got to be a fortune in that you know i've got all we've got to do is get together and figure out some way to to use these diapers in some useful product you know some some some
 	
 	
 		huh like like compost
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah
 		or or or or a compost brick uh you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know build your next sky rise out of compost brick you know you'd see the little blue things flickering through it but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think that might give it a little added
 		touch of something i'm not sure what
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		no but that so they're aware of it in Texas huh
 	
 	
 		they are yeah they're uh like i said we've we've just recently i guess in our part we're like right in the middle of the state and you know we're not more in some of the metropolitan areas like Dallas or Houston or something but that you you are starting to see more
 		big large uh recycling like dumpsters where
 	
 	
 		that makes my heart sore because the last time i was in Texas
 		was on a hunting trip and i was there with a couple of buddies and we had filled up a couple of cans we're going down the road about eighty miles an hour and rolled down the window and just threw them out now
 	
 	
 		oh no you messed with Texas
 	
 	
 		uh i i will have to say that the people i was there with were Texans
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i was visiting it was not my idea
 	
 	
 		well you know they've got these adopt a highway programs they have to give the convicts something to do you know
 	
 	
 		well i i understand that and i think that that that he's certainly contributed to that
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm gonna say i don't typically
 	
 	
 		i want you to know you've taken a big load off my chest i've never been able to to confess that to anyone and now i've gotten to confess it
 	
 	
 		well i'm i'm happy to oblige  not happy that you did it but you know
 	
 	
 		well something's got to be done i tell you what i was just watching a a show the other night on on Antarctica uh
 		and how they're wanting to make it a a uh
 		an international park zone so that no one country you know gets down there and trashes it for mining rights or any other thing and um uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it just it just amazes me uh you know that that that there's so little left on this earth where there is that sort of thing and of course the only reason that that place is left is because the damn
 		climate is so inhospitable that no one can live down there you know
 	
 	
 		right right yeah well of course  they're they're trying real hard to devise ways to sustain life more comfortably down there just so they can get at some of those resources
 	
 	
 		yeah well they're they're doing it they you know they're they're learning and and it's inevitably doomed and speck you know all they got to do is find one speck of platinum or one speck of gold or uranium and and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well there's already oil there isn't there
 	
 	
 		well they not uh not absolutely for sure now there is some off offshore
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but as far as on the continent i don't think that anyone drilled a rig on the continent yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh in any event
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i think we all just sort of have to hunker down and do something about it but you know it's like we we we have all the needs that you know a civilized society has and i think that it's not
 		all our responsibility to to do that i mean the the the manufacturers would would manufacture things in ways that were biodegradable and did not
 		damage the the the environment you know i think that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those products
 	
 	
 		oh boy there there's such a higher level of consciousness about that now that's that's got to be i mean if you could come up with something like that just to the the marketing advantage would be phenomenal
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think that the people are ready to pay a little extra for that kind of marketing
 	
 	
 		yeah i well i think we've already seen that i mean just in the the this the few products that have uh plugged that is a is an advantage you know it costs more and people have jumped on them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i i know i'm willing i just uh you know it's just i i have certain needs for certain things and uh you know i really can't help it how it is packaged
 	
 	
 		yeah right right and then as soon as something comes along that is that that you need and all of a sudden it's available and in a environmentally
 	
 	
 		i have the need for what's there
 		found ways and i will switch immediately and i think probably the rest of the planet will too
 	
 	
 		conscious package
 		i i tend to agree and it sure would be nice to see something like that
 	
 	
 		well listen it's been a pleasure talking with you Steve right
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right i sure enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		alright well you take care and listen uh the next time you run over a beer can in the road
 	
 	
 		i'll think of you  okay  bye-bye
 	
 	
 		please do
 		alright bye
