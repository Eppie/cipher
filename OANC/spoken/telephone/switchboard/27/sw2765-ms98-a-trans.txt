 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		i was afraid for a while she wasn't going to find anyone because they were all out on the golf course
 	
 	
 		oh really well it's it's raining in Texas right now in my area so there's probably not any golfers out on the course
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		they just they just said that the uh Byron Nelson Tournament here had been suspended
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		for because of rain of course that's just for today it'll it'll play again finish tomorrow you know or finish today's round tomorrow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well near Dallas you're used to playing golf in the wind too
 	
 	
 		oh right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i i'm not really much of a golfer i have not played golf in probably fifteen years but uh it it is an intention to take up the  the uh sport again
 	
 	
 		the biggest problem with it i think is time
 	
 	
 		right uh
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i know that it's a four hour dedication
 		it could be four hour relaxation or it could be gritting on your nerves which you're using that much time
 		uh and not not having that much fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right well yeah if if you're good at it i guess it's a
 		not so much frustration but if you are it it you know if you're not a really good golfer it it can be real frustrating real frustrating
 	
 	
 		you know and i i played tennis for exercise but i play golf for fun uh and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		apparently it's the attitude that you have that makes the big difference
 		the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i enjoy catching it too do you ever go out to the
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i it's been a while since i've been out to watch i do watch a little on TV you know when i have the chance but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		i keep wondering why i you can understand in sports like uh basketball or baseball or football there's an age
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh position in there but i keep wondering why
 		some of the real legends can't go just a little bit longer than they do
 	
 	
 		well you know i wonder that too in watching some of these senior tournaments uh you know the uh the seniors skins and stuff like that on TV you see how well they're playing and you and you wonder why they're they're not able to you know to play with
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		
  
 		it the regular tour
 	
 	
 		with the with the younger guys on the regular tour
 	
 	
 		and they do mix some of them mix it but it's uh it it does amaze me sometimes just to see it i don't know whether it's a lack of concentration
 		or particular muscle development or what but it seems to be uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i to me it's not a sport that you would
 		be overwhelmed with muscle activity in it
 	
 	
 		right well as i understand it and of course it's like i said it's been a while since i played but uh as i understand it as you do get older that your concentration in the putting area you know really suffers and
 		that's that's the primary reason that some of these older that you know that the old players don't play as well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i tell you what it's a sport that has a great number of jokes though
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i
 	
 	
 		i as i said i play tennis and there are no tennis jokes i don't know if you can think of one at all
 	
 	
 		i guess come to think of it i've never heard a tennis joke
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but but there are a slew of golf jokes so it it indicated and it's great uh sport for equalizing the handicap system
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		allows you to play competitively even though you don't play on the same level play competitively
 		with just about anyone you know i can go out and stand a chance of winning a dime off of Jack Nicholas
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh if
 		the handicap system uh worked properly and it should so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's nice to be able to to uh compete
 		and and be together with someone
 		and yet
 		have a basis for competitiveness such as uh ten cent be anything over a a dime i joke on so
 	
 	
 		and perhaps and perhaps even learn a little bit of something
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yes oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's interesting we're talking about golf the television own in my den right now and i'm watching a ball roll up about four inches from the hole  in today's Byron Nelson so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you know that's one of the other things i i'd i'm am fascinated sometimes two sports bring it to mind more quickly than any others but all the other
 		functions that the human body performs really are are uh
 		as equally amazing But when you start thinking about the eye hand coordination and trying to get a little sphere
 		uh four hundred and twenty yards away into a little whole in about four shots
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's true you have loft of club and everything else but knowing how far to bring it back and the
 		the concentration and all the things that go on in the human body to get it there
 	
 	
 		there's a awful lot of mechanics involved in
 	
 	
 		yeah the same the same thing is true with basketball where a a fellows running along and runs and jumps up in the air and then pushes the basketball toward uh a hoop and it swishes through
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the the the human body is amazing and i think i'd like to see
 		uh
 		elements like that in almost everything i do and golf
 		uh i walk down the fairways sometimes just thinking about that and then of course i'll miss the putt
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah so well what uh what course do you get to play on over in North Carolina
 	
 	
 		but
 		we just moved here from from Oklahoma as a matter of fact and i'd been in Oklahoma for twenty years up in Enid
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but so uh i'm used to the wind too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact that's the only that areas the only place i know of that you really have to uh consider the wind on putts  out on the grass green and everything else but the wind effect
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah but i guess in North Carolina you you're in an area where there are some really nice courses
 	
 	
 		oh i know it i know we had just moved to Charlotte and uh i've gone to a couple of uh public courses uh we haven't settled in here yet we're just
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		here temporarily but
 		a
 		the courses are beautiful and you can play just about year round on it too
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		now Richardson maybe you can too
 	
 	
 		yeah right Richardson h as it's you know it's pretty close to year round there are times uh well i guess that there are times in the winter you know when you can't play but then there are times when
 		you know when it thaws out and warms up and people flock to the golf course you know in December and January so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		in fact uh the last few years i've had
 		in Oklahoma i went to Norman and it would play New Year's day down there now there it was stretching the imagination to enjoy it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but at least i played
 	
 	
 		yeah probably a week later it was warm enough you could have gone out and played and really enjoyed it even then so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		well i have enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah i have enjoyed it too i i really intend to play golf you know in the future my my wife and i even uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		are going to try to play together sometime you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well that that's a good sport when people enjoy it because it can be very social at the same time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		well it's been nice talking to you okay
 	
 	
 		good luck on the course
 	
 	
 		okay you too thanks
 	
 	
 		bye
