 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay um i don't have any i guess definite views about elderly care um
 		the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see where elderly people are abused and things like that i think that's one thing that i would look at if i was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		putting my grandmother or my mother uh
 		in some sort of home the first thing that i would look at would be their history
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		as far as any court cases that came out of there um the history of you know their doctors um their nurses and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i agree with you i um a group that i'm a part of goes once a month to a um they call it the Heritage House
 		they call it the Heritage House it's it's a nursing home for elderly people and this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape a lot of them have had
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um limbs amputated or um have serious illnesses you know that kind of thing and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i watched the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands it started out just being a terrible place for the people and then a new company bought it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and came in and remodeled the whole place hired new nurses and uh just really just redid it you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i'm just out of curiosity what what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place
 	
 	
 		well to me it was dirty for one thing uh when you would walk in the smell was just awful though you know the floors you could just
 	
 	
 		huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if you're walking on them feel how filthy they were um there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying and
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		of course i don't know how many of them were you know not in their right mind or how many were
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know yeah yeah i just really don't know but i feel like they were neglected and um
 	
 	
 		in pain or something yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's what i was going to say it sounds like to just neglect all over neglect you know to clean up and
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		right i don't really think anyone was being you know cruel or or trying to mistreat them or anything i just think they were
 		just not doing anymore you know than they had to do and um just kind of letting everybody live
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		in a not very good environment
 		but this new company came in and they like i said they remodeled the place and it smells nice when you walk in and it looks nice and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they got like several new color TV's for the people and and redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more interesting place for them to be they made a little patio area where they can go outside and
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah just you know small things that make it seem a lot more
 	
 	
 		homely yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's like it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just uh horrible
 	
 	
 		i would i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or
 		anyone is in a home like that and my biggest fear would that they would be is that they would be lonely
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i would like to know that there are
 		you know just a lot of activities like you said you know just putting a plant in a room you know Just makes just brightens and and and just makes them just a little more active television
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they can go outside and just to know that they're not you know laying in a room looking at gray walls you know that that would
 	
 	
 		right
 		right with nothing you know
 	
 	
 		that that's what would just really kill me i'd like to know that you know they have friends there and they you know have little conversations and things i'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		right
 		um
 	
 	
 		maybe some kind of of activity little field trips or something i don't know how they would do that but
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		well they uh this place that we visit it's really neat they have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they will do bingo our group does a church service once a month and and then other groups come in and do the services you know other Sundays so that they have at least one service every Sunday and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so there are a lot of things there are places that have a lot of things for them to do
 		but you really do have to kind of seek it out you know and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and make sure that it's not a place like this one was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that that's really neat that's really neat
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah it is it's real nice and um i know our church does it and there are a lot of other churches and they are just like civic organizations that do
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i have other friends it's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		make sure it's a friendly animal you know and take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that is great for that that will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew you know that the puppy is coming on Wednesday
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that would be something to look for that's really neat that really is
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah there's a lot that can be done it's just a matter of people not being lazy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know doing the best they can again i don't know what i'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know uh that would be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		putting putting any of my family in an elderly
 		home to me would be a the very last resort you know it
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		um and i know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to to work or trying to take care of your own family it's kind of hard to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to to because an elderly person sometimes can be
 		totally dependent you know on you and i know that's hard sometimes and but it would really have to be a last resort because that would just i would feel so guilty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah i would too
 	
 	
 		just i don't know unless i knew that they were somewhere just really
 		i mean just really great you know that they were really enjoying
 	
 	
 		yeah right yeah
 		yeah i know i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		i don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home
 	
 	
 		yeah well i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because um
 		um many of them of course their minds are not good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so a lot them have told me exactly the same story you know every time i visit them
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		they'll tell me they'll reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did and then the next time i go it's the same thing you know but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just somebody to listen to them uh just seems to make them really feel good
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		to nod their head and smile at them
 	
 	
 		right i'll tell you the people i feel the sorriest for there's a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he's really an intelligent person but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		and um he's blind and he has seizures you know i mean he's just like in a world of his own and yet he wants so much to be around people
 	
 	
 		um
 		right
 	
 	
 		and if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he'll grab it and kiss it and oh he's always got a smile i mean he really tries to
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		to brighten up your life oh it's just amazing um but he can't say anything he can just kind of make noises you know
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's something that i mean if i had to work
 		in an elderly home i don't think i could do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like i i would really like to be a teacher
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't think i could do it because i'm very very emotional
 	
 	
 		me too
 	
 	
 		and the minute i mean the minute something happens i mean i cry on i mean you know Hallmark commercials but i'm just that's just the end of me
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		i know
 		i know
 	
 	
 		and so i mean something real life i just i'm
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		i uh interview a lot of children i'm an education reporter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i always go you know everyday i'm doing an education things and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i meet these kids who are you know dropping out of school left and right and all the sudden they're in this program they're making straight A's they're going to graduate early
 	
 	
 		um
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i'm just i just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic and you know i could just imagine you know working in a home like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and those people they're so sweet and and so genuine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and all they want is just for everything to be happy and you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and so that would probably just tear me apart i mean in a good way but you know
 	
 	
 		oh it does yeah
 		yeah yeah it is it's really hard and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids i have a three year old and a six year old and they um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		have gotten comfortable being around these people because they've always gone with us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the people love them and
 	
 	
 		i'm sure
 	
 	
 		they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand and so far my kids will do it just real easily
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think it's because they've gone since they were real little and they've never been afraid but that's something to me children
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know need to people need to take groups of children  because the kids just brighten up their lives they
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as we walk through the the lobby they'll all say bring her here i want to see her  i would love to hold her
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and children i mean
 		usually a lot of elderly people like to
 		they like to uh share their experiences with the younger children they'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they don't even know what they mean but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		you know they feel like they've lived life so they need to share it and i'm sure i'll be like that too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well me too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it's quite an experience
 	
 	
 		but that's great i didn't know there were such groups
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah there are and and uh it really helps those people i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but like you said i'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it would be a last resort
 	
 	
 		and i would hate it if anyone put me in one women
 	
 	
 		oh i know i'm always afraid like oh no what if i lose my mind am i going to end up in a place like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		somebody take care of me
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		okay thus
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		okay well nice to talk to you
 	
 	
 		yeah you too Tonya thanks for calling bye
