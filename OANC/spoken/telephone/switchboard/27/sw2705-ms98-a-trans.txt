 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um what area do you are you in what area of the country
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh i'm in southwest Houston
 	
 	
 		oh in Houston okay i'm up in Plano near Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh where
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you live in a suburb or
 	
 	
 		yeah i live in uh um
 		well i live uh i live about five minutes from the TI plant and it's in uh a it's in the a leaf area which doesn't mean anything to you but it's in a it's in a subdivision and it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		probably
 		uh i don't know three bedroom house with uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know fenced in yard and it's it's an older house it's about twenty years old i bought it about four years ago and i've been kind of fixing it up and uh doing things to it as i can
 	
 	
 		is it
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i love it i'm just it's a lot of work though i'll tell you
 	
 	
 		what fixing it up or keeping it up yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		keeping it up and uh i've decided that i was going to try to do my own yard this year so i've
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh i've you know it takes me three days like come home one afternoon and mow and one day edge and another day weed eat and then my stupid magnolia tree is dropping leaves and the raking and the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep
 		yep
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i thought wait a minute this is and now it's ninety five degrees almost here in Houston it's horrible but anyway so how how about your house
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		yeah
 		so you don't want
 		well we have a really large house we have three kids and we bought a five bedroom house when we moved here and um it's getting to be too much  too much work to keep it up
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness uh-huh
 		
 
 		how many kids do you have
 	
 	
 		three three so we have a bedroom for everybody and then we have an extra playroom for them to pile all their toys in and an extra TV up there and the ironing board
 	
 	
 		three kids
 		and you're a working you're a working mom too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well yeah i that's the other thing is i was working uh full time i just started back about a year and a half ago
 		and um my youngest one got to be three years old and so then i went back to work and i decided after a year of being a secretary that what i really wanted to do was go back and get my master's degree
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um so then i went to part-time work and i'm going to school part-time
 		and uh it's getting to be too much financially too without my full time income so we're we're just decided to put last week to put our house on the market and um get a smaller house not too small though with three kids
 	
 	
 		smaller house
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		so so that that was kind of a hard decision to make but i think uh i it's just been an awful lot you know financial is one thing and that's kind of concrete but also it's just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there it the house is just really big and there there's a lot of kids and a lot of space and it all gets messed up
 	
 	
 		i know i you know i can imagine gee
 	
 	
 		so and with cleaning out to you know to sell the house we're trying to clean things out in closets and the playroom and the garage and everything
 		and when you have this much space you don't have to be as careful about throwing stuff out you just put it in the garage or put it in the playroom or something
 		so it's just we just have massive stuff that you know is we just accumulated too much stuff i mean not that we have a whole bunch of things it's just little junky you know old toys
 	
 	
 		well it it
 		you tend to fill up what area you have you you don't have a whole you know when i moved into this house i thought oh wow because i moved here from an apartment
 	
 	
 		that's it
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and apartments you can't accumulate a whole lot because you just don't have room to put it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		there's no place to put it yeah
 	
 	
 		and now you know well you've got the garage you know so going to a smaller place yeah you're going to you'll find
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's going to be great though it makes it gives you a good feeling when you've got clean out the stuff and get rid of it
 	
 	
 		you know yeah you have more control control over it it seems almost like it's taking control here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		a lot of things in the garage that you know you never use you never want you know why do i keep them there's you know it's just filling up the garage
 	
 	
 		but
 		right
 		yeah yeah it's just because you have to physically go out there and go through it i guess when you
 	
 	
 		so you have to
 		um-hum well i kept kept things that see my children are grown and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh some of the stuff you know was from when they were growing up so what you know you hate to throw it out but they don't want it and you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i'll probably keep it keep it a while but it's it's amazing how a house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		get yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know how you do it with your children and although i you know
 	
 	
 		it's crazy
 	
 	
 		well me i did it too but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but oh it's it's a tough deal
 	
 	
 		i think well i don't i really have uh really relaxed standards about how well organized and cleaned it is i mean it has to be basically clean because
 		you have to be organized enough enough to know where things are to be able to find things if it gets too messy you spend your whole life going through trying to find what you need
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i learned that it has you have to maintain a certain standard of cleanliness but i mean organization but
 		i i mean compared to the other mothers here on my street that don't work i mean my house is just it looks horrible compared to theirs
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i mean you have to decide what you're going to do you know if you going to
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		what's the most important thing yeah so that's what slides for me
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		you know you have to decide is the house going to run your life or are you going to run your life yeah you just
 	
 	
 		right exactly
 	
 	
 		but it is it's it's it is a lot of a lot of work
 	
 	
 		yeah and we this house was new when we bought it and it's all white walls and so we put up some wallpaper and some drapes and you know but we just never got we didn't have the money we didn't have the time to really decorate it
 		and i was said to my husband if we had a smaller house it wouldn't take you know hundreds of dollars to decorate one room it of
 		you see we did this one huge wall that we have and it was like three hundred dollars worth of wallpaper and i didn't even buy that expensiv e kind you know that it wouldn't even cost that much but it was it's a real long wall
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so if we had a smaller house  everything would be smaller and it it wouldn't take well it took us two weekends to put all the wallpaper up you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		but i have a feeling it's going to be hard
 	
 	
 		are you have you started looking for another house
 	
 	
 		uh
 		we have we have driven around in the neighborhood we don't want our children to have to change s chools we want to try and stay in the same school area so we've driven around the neighborhood and we've looked from the outside but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i still trying to find time to get this house this weekend we're going to finish up the garage and we're going to do you know i have a few other things i need to do here and then after that i hope
 		that this house will be good enough for people to come through and look at it and then i want to start going to some open houses and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um you know look at some
 		but i've talked a lot with our realtor about it and she assured me we could get you know a four bedroom house in the price range that we want
 		in that area she said you're not going to like it as much as this one  i said yeah no kidding
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh well are prices holding you know you be able to get what you've got in that house you think
 	
 	
 		but
 		um yeah for this house it's just in this area of Plano it seems the the houses are moving really quickly they said my realtor said about three to six months and maybe closer to the three months because we live
 		half a block from the elementary school
 	
 	
 		oh that's a real plus um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that's real nice yeah
 		and it is five bedrooms she said you you it's really hard to find that and most places places have four and there are people that really want five so that's another plus so it might be closer to three months
 		and you know we'll be if we're real lucky we won't lose any money you know we'll we'll be able it's mostly the closing costs that are going to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that you we can we'll be be uh asking for more than we bought the house for three years ago but the closing costs are going to eat out just about all of it so
 	
 	
 		so maybe you can get enough to cover that
 	
 	
 		yeah then we'll feel really we'll feel good about it
 	
 	
 		so are you you you you're basically going to have to sell that one before you can
 	
 	
 		so
 		before we can look too much yeah
 	
 	
 		or commit to something else anyway
 	
 	
 		right that's what that's what our realtor wants to do i've talked to some other people who have put contingencies on their houses
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um but our our realtor just doesn't really like to do that she doesn't even want me to go out and look and fall in love with something until you know i yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really i would have thought you know at least go and start looking at least to know
 	
 	
 		well i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to tell her you know when i have
 		the time that's the hard thing i have finals right now because i'm taking two classes i have finals and papers and stuff so in um two weeks from now i should be pretty well set
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm going to go out there and look i'm going to tell her i i want to know i want to have a feeling before i sign saying i'm going to sell this house i have to see what exactly it is that we're going to be moving into
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so  but i trust her pretty much in that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know she knows what we're looking for and she knows what's out there so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so how about in Houston how is it down there
 	
 	
 		well
 		well i think uh you know i think uh real estate houses are uh it's
 		it's selling much better than than it than than they did i think new homes new homes in certain areas uh you know are are are doing very well uh and i think uh
 	
 	
 		is it getting better
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when i bought this house was actually it's be in May it'll be five years and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		this was uh a foreclosure
 		a foreclosure foreclosure and uh so i mean it was had had been pretty bad in this area for for awhile
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and uh i guess over the past year it sort of i got my uh the appraisal you know the thing you get for what they're base your taxes on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's gone up from it went down from what i bought it for and then and now it's come back up
 	
 	
 		oh
 		come back up oh good yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well but then again i i didn't care if it went down as long as i don't want to sell it because then i have my taxes are going to be less but
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's true i didn't think about that that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh but you can tell by just riding around my neighborhood
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh when i bought when i like i say when i bought this house there was oh just many many homes for sale and uh now uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you don't see quite as many and i and there's a lot of people like i just put a new roof on my house and repainted the outside and uh about a three or four weeks
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
