 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay yeah i'm originally from New York and i go visit a lot and their real estate up there is i mean ridiculous absolutely ridiculous
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		an apartment here like i live in an apartment and my apartment is three fifteen a month and it's just the one it's a one bedroom
 	
 	
 		and how big is it
 	
 	
 		which is still kind of expensive but i prefer to live in uh in a nice part of town because i feel safe here and i i i pay more to feel safe you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right well what's what's included in that
 	
 	
 		you mean in a one bedroom oh nothing hum-um i mean just
 	
 	
 		like washer dryer or nothing
 	
 	
 		nothing no microwave we've got i have ceiling fan i guess that's something it's real cute it's got a little vaulted ceiling and mirrored um mirrored uh
 	
 	
 		wow yeah
 		which one is it
 	
 	
 		it's Wood um  listen to me i can't even think of the name of my own apartment Woodhollow right next to Village Green it's on yeah kind of far North Waco
 	
 	
 		where
 		oh okay okay yeah i i used to live in Waco so
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah far north like on Lake Shore where all those apartments are it's right up there so
 	
 	
 		yeah yes yes
 		yeah um we live in a house here and uh it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a three bedroom two bath and uh i it's it i don't know i got two numbers today actually we were talking about mortgage insurance today with my agent and uh it's about sixteen hundred square feet which is fine for the two of us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it it you know we looked at a lot of houses that were had more square footage but they didn't use it right you know it was a bunch of empty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know hallway and stuff that  yeah yeah really so we've used every bit of it and our house um
 	
 	
 		that could have been used as yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we bought it for sixty four and uh the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventy five
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i you know i think we were  you know got a good deal on it considering yeah yeah yeah well
 	
 	
 		yeah so that looks good when you all get ready to sell you'll probably do really well my father used to live in Dallas uh now he he went back to New Jersey we're originally from the East but he
 	
 	
 		oh really my husband's from New Jersey
 	
 	
 		oh really  he uh well actually right now he lives in Rhode Island he
 		lived in New Jersey for a while now he's in Rhode Island and um he used to like to go and we used to go just every weekend just to look at houses for no reason we weren't buying one every weekend but just to look at them
 		and so i got a pretty good feel of you know what i want when i do you know get my house whenever that is um
 		what was i going to say about that  i completely lost my train of thought um but we we enjoy going looking at houses and and um we now i kind of have a good idea of what i want i know i want a big family area um
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what we were looking for the first thing
 	
 	
 		yeah fire a fireplace i saw this awesome house the other weekend it was a great big family room and it was circular and the other side was the patio and the backyard
 		and it had a built in uh grill and every i mean it was it was just an ultimate the ultimate party room you know i was but that's pretty nice
 	
 	
 		wow um-hum yeah
 		but that's what we had uh uh that's what we had looked for was our main concern was a big living room you know and big closet space you know i said
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right yeah i like a lot of closet space i don't like because i don't like to have a lot of things out you know just all over the place i like to have them kind of tucked away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		and uh so that's that's what we went for first and and it you know we we don't we just have a big living room an and a dining room is separate
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know some places have like the house next door to us that we looked at had a living room a dining room and a den but to stick a wall between two rooms
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den so we opted for the just the whole wide room that went from one end of the house to the other just about
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		my father had uh i keep talking about my father because he owned a house um
 		he had the kitchen kind of a kitchen and a very long family room it's just kind of one room and what he did he put uh a bar right in the center and put some um a glass rack
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		down so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar and it just kind of it kind of separated it it was still you know together but it just looked a lot better
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i personally don't like the combination
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		rooms so
 	
 	
 		right i but i i think for where we are um i think we got a real good deal on it and we you know we have a uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the backyard is just huge it is just really i think another house could fit back there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i'd like a big backyard
 	
 	
 		and uh we really liked it of course when you have to mow it  you know in uh middle of August it's it's kind of a little hot yeah but uh it's it's nice and that was
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah a little hot try to do it early in the mornings
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know a big selling point too and i think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they've lived there and have it all built up you know they've got a whole garden and trees and everything so it's not like we're uh kind of secluded you know we don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours
 	
 	
 		hum
 		wow
 		
 
 		uh-huh well that's good yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is like a lot of the little model homes that they  you know throw up in three days
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  that's true they do throw those up
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		are you all planning to move anytime are you looking for a house or not um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		no no not at all in fact uh we we talked about that just a little bit you know we were joking around about uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		winning a sweepstakes and what would we do with the money and Steve said we'll i'll buy a bigger house and i said no i would just fix this one  you know there's you know because we i like where it is and i like how it's laid out and it took us forever
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah really
 		um-hum
 		to find it um-hum
 	
 	
 		to find it but when we found it it was we knew it yeah
 	
 	
 		you knew that was it  i'll probably i'll probably move but i'll probably move to another apartment or something because i'm i'm i'm really
 	
 	
 		yeah have you had any
 	
 	
 		um what's the word i move a lot anyway because the job i have i only work like here i'll be here for like a year and then i'll move off i can move up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		where
 	
 	
 		and so i'm a i'm a news reporter i work at Channel Six and so this is like my first job so i won't be here very long so i'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house
 	
 	
 		oh okay oh okay
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know so i'm staying staying in an apartment and i'm not married or anything so it's no biggie
 	
 	
 		um yeah and that's and that's one thing is once you you know you get into a house it's like you you get more stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work  God i can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff and it actually fit you know of course we got it on a little bit of more furniture and stuff but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		like i'm amazed at how much stuff i've accumulated in my apartment because up to this point i was in school and so i'd go home every summer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i could take all my stuff home because i didn't have a bed or a couch or any any of that but now i could not move back home and i just realized this you know the other day i'm going wait a minute i can't go back home for the summer or anything i have too much stuff so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was just like a weird transition out of home  so i have to move in apartments just because i have so much stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's actually three fifteen over there's probably not real real bad for for Waco and and for as many gosh as many as apartments and condos are over there
 	
 	
 		no it's not it's not yeah
 		oh my goodness yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean it it's just and and especially around Lake Shore area that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah um-hum there there are tons of apartments down here i mean and it
 	
 	
 		yeah because i i had lived in the gosh i'm not sure what they're called now but they were Lake Shore Apartments that are like right next to the baseball field MCC Baseball field but
 	
 	
 		MCC yeah yeah i i think they're called Lake Shore Villa or something
 	
 	
 		no the ones next door to those there were Lake Shore there's a i don't know what they look like now
 	
 	
 		hum and it's a nursing there was a nursing home or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah there was a nursing home and then there's an apartment and then there's another apartment and we lived in those those third ones and they we moved in when they were brand new uh you know we drive by now and think gosh you know look how much it's changed an
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um i think that uh-huh
 		yeah
 		how often do you all come through Waco
 	
 	
 		oh ever now and then um it just we
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		depends on what's going on
 	
 	
 		it's uh yeah and it's not really now that it's sixty five it doesn't take hardly anytime to get there you know run to the mall or run to Sam's or
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		or whatever we used to run to Red you know Red Lobster but now they've got one in Killeen so we don't have to run that far so that's that's about how things are and the seems like the market here's picking up yeah i really think it is
 	
 	
 		um-hum  all right
 		hum
 		you think uh-huh uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		just for the fact that the
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know it's
 		it seemed like as soon as we bought this house
 		we saw all these houses for sale you know and i think now a lot of them are selling and a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of you know just having to give it away
 	
 	
 		um
 		Waco to me seems seems like it's pretty steady i mean i'm not a real estate person or anything but it it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a real college town and so you know you have these apartments and then the the houses are all most of the houses are pretty nice and i don't i don't you know really see a lot on sale or anything and people are pretty stable here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i kind of see this as kind of a retirement community  as i always call it yeah um um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah i i saw i see that a lot too there and it's nice too i liked living there
 	
 	
 		nice and quiet
 		so i don't think i could live here much longer but   i'll deal with it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		well i guess we chewed up the house market and apartment market for a while
 	
 	
 		well it
 		yeah really okay well it was very nice talking to you okay you take care okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		you too Tanya all right bye-bye
