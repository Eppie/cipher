 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay are you on any kind of uh regular exercise plan
 	
 	
 		i i yeah i'm
 		yeah i i do aerobics uh step classes and um
 		toning classes yes
 	
 	
 		step classes
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		it's um it's a new uh form i think uh it's like low impact aerobics but at it
 	
 	
 		oh instead of hopping and jumping your just stepping
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah you you have a step and you literally step up on the step and move your arms it's it's it's it's new it's fun
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		huh
 		i probably couldn't do that because of my knee
 	
 	
 		uh-huh bad knee
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um and uh i do toning a lot and uh some every once in a while i play tennis
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not too great at it but i i try to play
 	
 	
 		yeah i've
 		i've kind of gotten out of the habit myself i mean it's i guess what i do now is i play softball right now that's about well right now i'm on two teams so it's four nights a week but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		uh so i enjoy it but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		as far as you know uh instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there i went and bought a weight bench and don't ever hardly use it need to need to make myself do that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right yeah
 		yeah i slacked off a little because of um
 		i'm about to graduate from college and so this past couple months have been really hectic so i haven't really gone and i've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out but
 	
 	
 		what school you going to
 	
 	
 		i'm at East Carolina
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but um
 		no i uh my step classes and toning is about the only thing well i mean
 	
 	
 		now what's what's toning is that lifting lifting weights
 	
 	
 		it's it's um like isolated movements for each muscle certain muscles groups you can do with
 	
 	
 		oh okay isometrics stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah you can do it with certain you know you can do it with weights if you wanted to but you know you leave out of there usually the next morning if you haven't done it in a while you wake up the next morning you're like oh no what did i do to myself and your whole body aches you know um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i know i'm looking forward to getting back into
 		getting into shape uh
 		i feel like i'm out of shape but i feel guilty for not going because i really i'm i'm so used to going for you know three or four years now but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i
 		stayed in pretty good shape during school i played baseball all the way through and you know working out six hours a day usually six or seven days a week that kind of kept us all in pretty good shape
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh ever ever since i got out of school you know just jumped right into the job and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess the job that i'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because i work some weird hours and do some traveling and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no some
 		um
 		i walk a lot because uh you know being in in school we i don't know if your campus was anything like ours but our parking lot's in one end of the of the campus and the school the buildings are all at the other end so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		no i didn't have well much of a problem we i guess i went to a small Baptist school and we had about when i was there maybe thirteen hundred people  so it's pretty small yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh okay that's if yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh
 		i live i live on the second story apartments so i walk up and down stairs all day long so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh we've got a one story house now that's that's enough i guess i push the lawn mower around that's fairly regular
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's one of the exercise now i i um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		would like to start running
 		i've never been much of a runner but i want to start i want to run but i don't i don't know if i'll be able to to do it
 	
 	
 		what just because you you don't like to or because because you won't be able to
 	
 	
 		i'm  i'm afraid i won't be able to i wish i'd
 	
 	
 		oh if you do if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running
 	
 	
 		yeah i hope not
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we've we've ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i don't even own a bike i think the last time i was on a bike when i was about twelve so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know i'd be afraid  afraid i probably forgot how to ride a bike you know
 	
 	
 		no you can't forget how to ride a bike
 	
 	
 		yeah but um
 		no i guess
 		that's about the only form i'm trying to think of of other things that i do that
 		would be considered exercise  or things i should do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		now when i was going to i i went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred well when we were at this junior college uh
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		our coach you know we one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so they uh i mean it was a regular i mean we had it for course credit but still i mean it was pretty high impact stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		those aerobic classes are are tough the the high impact
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		definitely are are tough classes
 	
 	
 		yeah and she'd uh you know most of the guys were all in one class so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		first thing eight i think we had eight o'clock in the morning was our class
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		wake up
 	
 	
 		well now they have those uh
 		those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight you have like bands i don't know if you've seen them they're
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i think my wife has some
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're weird they're uh you get uh
 		they're just made of i guess it's different kinds of rubber uh and they get
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		or sand even some of them well no they're elastic so i guess it wouldn't be sand
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and there's some that
 		like the different colors denotes how much they
 		how much the tension i guess they are and how easy they are to move
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh there's like i know there's purple gray and uh green and some of them are real short and they're the ones that are the tough ones to use you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		those classes i i enjoy uh i think uh
 		with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's
 		fun if you don't have one that's fun and not enjoy it look not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing the class is not going to get out uh what they should get out of the class
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		if the
 	
 	
 		so are you going to get into instructing well what are you studying
 	
 	
 		oh i'm an interior design major
 	
 	
 		oh okay  not in the not in the
 		aerobic instructor type field
 	
 	
 		oh no no no no oh i could never do that i don't think
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'd rather just be the student
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		oh occasionally i do the weights at the health club but
 		low weights just
 	
 	
 		yeah the uh the some of the Nautilus equipment that i started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting i mean they they they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with those things but man they are
 		ah uh i don't know to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right well they um i just noticed at our health club they
 		they put on these computerized one these computerized machines and you set a speed on it and the weight and it and it makes you do it and it tells you like if you're going too slow it will say my grandmother could do this faster than you
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and stuff like a turtle goes faster and um it tells it and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you
 	
 	
 		a little negative reinforcement there while you're going
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so uh do that stuff like that but just i've never used those machines i just use the regular
 		machines and the free weights you know like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just to do you know some bicep tricep exercises
 		sit-ups of course
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's that's where i'm really starting to get noticeable i'm just getting real soft in the middle
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		i think that's uh number one problem with everyone
 	
 	
 		um-hum i haven't really started to put on a lot of weight i'm i guess i probably put on about ten nine or ten pounds since i stopped playing which was about four years ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i've just myself i just notice myself just really real soft and i'm sure i don't have near the endurance that i did
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i i intend i keep saying i intend to get back into it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just need to
 		put the old nose to the grindstone i i i guess at that point it would turn into a task
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't consider it fun doing that but
 	
 	
 		right yeah i plan on getting back once i graduate next weekend
 	
 	
 		next weekend all right
 	
 	
 		next weekend yeah one week  then i plan to get right back into it
 		you know it's it does a lot for you i think makes you feel a lot better
 	
 	
 		yeah oh no yeah there there's no no question the the end result is great and i i mean i enjoyed you know we when i was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and i mean you feel so much better about yourself just that you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner
 	
 	
 		oh i still don't but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
