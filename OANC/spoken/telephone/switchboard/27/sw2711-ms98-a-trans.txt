 		was Seattle
 	
 	
 		oh really i've heard it's really pretty up there
 	
 	
 		well
 		we uh
 		was two years ago

 		oh
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		it didn't rain for a whole week
 	
 	
 		yeah  that would have been nice that would have been best time to go
 	
 	
 		yeah somehow we picked the right time and uh
 		walked down on the wharf and i think we ate seafood every meal for
 		well not quite every meal but most meals for a week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh it was wonderful uh the Pacific Science Museum the little girl really enjoyed it's
 		very interesting
 	
 	
 		Pacific Sites
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yes it was it was super and uh
 		went to the Seattle Aquarium
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's right down there
 		on the
 		right there on the ocean and
 		down there on the wharf by the piers and all and
 		you walk down in a dome a glass dome
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the bay is circulating over your head and you
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		you can watch the fish swim by and sharks
 		oh it's
 	
 	
 		oh neat
 	
 	
 		yeah and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises and oh it's it's amazing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's the vacation you recommend huh
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		without a doubt
 		Seattle is beautiful and the mountains the mountains to the east of Seattle
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard it is
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		are just incredible
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i rode a ferry for the first time in my life
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		you know up there
 		you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		instead of by bridge
 		and you drive your car on you park your car you set your brake you walk upstairs and you have a beer
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		or coffee or whatever depending on the time of day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's amazing
 	
 	
 		and your car is on a ferry and it goes across with you
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that's really neat
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and
 		there are people literally that
 		everyday take the ferry you know and drive on to it yeah
 	
 	
 		to work
 	
 	
 		live on an island off off shore from Seattle
 	
 	
 		huh
 		that's really wild
 	
 	
 		and
 		you uh everyday they drive on the ferry they go upstairs and have their morning coffee
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		take for the twenty to
 		hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and
 		you know depending on where it is
 	
 	
 		hour and ten minutes
 	
 	
 		well in some places you know in some areas you know depends on how far they are commuting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's really interesting
 	
 	
 		oh it it's strict i'm i'm a West Texan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		out there in the land of no water
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		and to think that people live on the water daily is kind of odd to me
 		you know it's it's a different life style
 		than we are used to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it is
 		i've been wanting to go to the West Texas and see different parts of Texas because i haven't lived here very long and i haven't really seen much
 		so what are some good things in Texas to go visit
 	
 	
 		oh Galveston
 	
 	
 		Galveston
 	
 	
 		yes i liked Galveston real well uh
 		there's uh one of the
 		areas down there close to Galveston is
 		i forget the name of the island but it's a bird sanctuary
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		with all kinds of wild birds
 		whooping and sand hill cranes and ducks and
 		pelicans and it's very pretty uh i like the Rio Grande Valley
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		real well of course you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone to the uh to the Alamo
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		Boardwalk and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah the river walk oh it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there oh it's just simply beautiful
 	
 	
 		i've heard it's really pretty
 	
 	
 		and of course always when i lived in West Texas had to annually go down to San Antone just
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and go to uh
 		Lone Star and uh you know
 		make my annual pilgrimage to the Lone Star Brewery and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		uh El Paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way you know go across the border and all uh the Davis Mountains are interesting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		out there in West Texas
 	
 	
 		down by Big Bend what's that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		because
 		there's a beauty to the desert that it can most be it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at it's most enjoyable
 		to get you know to get warm
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's nice uh
 		down there in the lower Rio Grande Valley
 		closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf that's interesting i love the Texas Hill Country
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and uh Austin is neat for for an occasional visit
 	
 	
 		i've heard to go to Austin too a lot people say to go down there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's a fun few days
 		uh
 	
 	
 		what's there to see in Austin
 	
 	
 		oh UT is real pretty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area Marble Falls and all that's real pretty uh
 		i would say definitely go see that part and uh
 		i'd say go to uh
 		Midland once just for the heck of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know why exactly
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		you know find out when they are holding
 		the
 		petroleum fair uh
