 
     		
 	
 		okay
 		well we're official now yeah
 	
 	
 		um yes
 		yeah it's um it's very hot in fact i've been cleaning because i live in an apartment so i can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um you know i have the little flower boxes with um a variety a lot of different flowers and i do enjoy plants but i don't have a yard or anything that i can do gardening really
 	
 	
 		oh you're you're you're not the so-called expert you need a house i guess to go through all of that i have had a couple of houses and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the only recommendation i would have for someone who hasn't gardened is uh one get a couple of good books of books of course and usually they have talk shows here in Dallas they have
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh-huh
 	
 	
 		two great uh talk shows that go through everything that will grow here which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are you know so
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh in fact you you could easily do that now listen to turn on a talk show up there and see if there there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in and and what kind of grass to grow up in Virginia and everything so i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for someone who doesn't garden i'd say that that's my biggest recommendation is to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh so you enjoy gardening
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i like it a lot uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh it's a lot of work i'm an engineer i'm i'm with TI you are you with TI up there or okay
 	
 	
 		no no i'm with a defense contractor
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um
 		where was oh yeah no i i like it i uh i always know that why i'm not a farmer when i garden though i mean it is dog work and it is tough
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i have a lot of trees down here uh
 		the part i don't like i guess would be from December
 		through February where you have to rake leaves
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		forever it seems like and the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		other than that you know those three months when it's pure dog work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences of of putting little plants in or whatever i i haven't had to plant any trees because i've got so many but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but i do listen to that talk show there there is some great people from Texas A&M i don't know
 		uh maybe you've heard of A&M down here but there's some great uh folks uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that have been well trained and again uh to
 		to uh recommend gardening for this area
 	
 	
 		um yeah i'm sure it is you know different in the different areas um i'm originally from Pennsylvania and i do go home on weekends during the summer and that and uh mow my mother's grass and different things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah you probably have rye grass up there we grow bermuda and Saint Augustine here
 	
 	
 		oh i would have no idea  no idea whatsoever
 	
 	
 		right yeah see you would have to learn that though see
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like i said i'm just a balcony kind of gardener with my little flowers and my flower boxes and my herbs on my window sill and
 	
 	
 		um
 		do you have much luck in the Winter don't they they're freeze it freeze out because the roots are all in the Winter uh or do you have to start all over every year
 	
 	
 		yeah i have to start all over every year well except i do have some um
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		some day lilies that um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i don't do anything with and they seem to come back year after year and i leave them on my balcony even in
 	
 	
 		in the same pot that's that's amazing
 	
 	
 		in the snow and the winter you know in the ice everything because here you know not as severe as the snow is in Pennsylvania but here we still do get some snow and ice and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		i grow a few things in pots but we have to bring them in here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in the Winter because usually
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh if it's not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing you know the pots will uh will die everything in a pot will die
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you can bring them well we do bring stuff in the garage and everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh it's quite time consuming by the way i don't know how close you are to getting a house or anything but it's quite uh but i would definitely do it
 		i'm all for doing everything whether whatever subject you pick uh do it the knowledgeable way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		don't go out there and start digging holes uh
 	
 	
 		right right i agree with that
 	
 	
 		get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		as as well as uh not your neighbors of course they usually know nothing but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh listen to still then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper for communications
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		as well as i bet there's a talk show up there right now that you if you turn the dial around you'll on Saturday this is Saturday that you'll find someone probably in the morning i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		discussing you know what we do up in Virginia to get something growing you probably don't have to do much over there the soil's probably so good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		our soil's not very good down here we're
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess in the ice age it it it's pushed a lot of uh
 		limestone and everything some parts of Dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh i think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the Johnny Appleseed type trees
 		where people have come from i'm sure when the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of of Dallas it's so scrubby
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and i think that we even got our famous hundred year old uh pecan trees from Alabama and all that too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we we call them native pecan trees but they grow wild here
 		they're eating pecans though pecans are probably not taken from Virginia they're probably only in the South
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh right i'm
 	
 	
 		for pecan pie and all that
 		it's what they call pecan pecan pie up there in in the East
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm from Pennsylvania and New Jersey i'm from New Jersey originally
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh you don't sound like it
 	
 	
 		i've worked on that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		with some chewing gum which i shouldn't do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		go ahead you what how many times you called by the way or how many times have you been called
 	
 	
 		um i've been called a lot  at the times though it's been not very
 		appropriate i guess that i haven't been able to actually participate i've participated probably in about maybe i don't know seven calls
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know i've called a couple of times but most of the time i notice that um you know it takes forever to get a call through
 	
 	
 		oh yeah today that's what i'm saying today i was i got to laugh because i tried it this morning and uh i thought everybody was gardening i thought well no no this is a great subject because they're out there gardening you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i didn't tell you what our weather is like it is beautiful here today
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah it's like eighty five degrees here
 	
 	
 		it's not quite that hot yeah we've had a real nice mild Spring uh
 		you might have seen if you've seen the news today about all the tornados here that were north of us
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know if you get CNN i don't get CNN but it's here at work in fact i'm at work today believe it or not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh they have uh TV's in the break areas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there was some some heavy tornados uh i guess in Kansas quite a few people were killed you'll see that on the evening news
 	
 	
 		oh my uh-huh i'll have to make sure i catch that
 	
 	
 		uh
 		tornados uh which is not the right subject but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they blow through here all in the Spring i guess it's related somewhat to the weather you know and and the plants and all that that uh sometimes they do essentially nothing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the weather men yesterday were all alert say hey there's something really terrible going to happen and they they sure were right but it wasn't in Texas it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		north of us yeah look at the news tonight they'll they'll they claim thirty odd people were killed up in Kansas City Kansas somewhere
 	
 	
 		i'll have to make sure i catch that
 		uh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		anyway back to planting
 		uh i have never studied it is very interesting uh subject uh
 		when you when did you get a house uh you your trees grow up so well up there but i'm sure you have plenty of trees
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that that is a key thing for shade
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and keeping your bills down uh
 		i guess you have mostly pine trees but where in Virginia are you all
 	
 	
 		um right now the District Washington um in Fairfax Virginia it's fifteen miles west of Washington DC
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh do you have the cherry blossoms and everything there or not
 	
 	
 		yeah there's there's a few not you know nearly as many as what's actually in the District but um they're definitely enjoyable right now i know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		yeah azaleas grow all over we grow those here too although again we have to prepare the soil
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you probably have nice big pine you probably have all kinds of trees the oaks and everything that's one thing i noticed about
 	
 	
 		yeah there there there is a vast variety here of you know trees like if i look out my window right now i can see you know couple of pine trees some oak trees
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have you ever been down here
 	
 	
 		um no actually i haven't
 	
 	
 		okay it's it's interesting country uh
 		it is wide open uh and flat
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and again as i said i think the when the Indians were here there there weren't any trees but the the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees and uh
 		a lot of them have done well uh they they do have some pine forest areas in west in west in east Texas where you have native pine trees but here in Dallas it's uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed and uh
 		uh Johnny Pecanseed whatever you would call it you know because there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees that we use for you know uh for eating
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop uh
 		hundred and fifty years ago because they are all over the place
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in the South
 		what else
 	
 	
 		um oh well  i guess that i really don't know that much
 	
 	
 		how many how many subject i i the subjects are usually pretty interesting i i'm i'm of course i'm a TI'er so i'm hoping this works TI is very good uh
 		has done a lot of experiments in the speech uh synthesis synthesis can't say it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they've come out with some new products uh some new in fact this week they came out with some new math uh you might see them in your advertisements uh new math uh Speak and Math uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh devices they they have had Speak and Spell and all that for years but they've come out with some different ones
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		this past week and uh
 		my wife and everyone ask me what what are they going to accomplish out of all this and i said well you're not going to have to type on the computer one day you're just going to have to talk to it
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know so you it's going to be much faster
 		of course you know the classical thing for the handicapped too person who can't type very fast or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		like i can of course
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh not that i can talk very fast either but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum but then what about people that um i i i personally work with someone that that is deaf and cannot speak she can speak but she can't
 		speak very clearly and she in fact is a data entry person i mean she types away all day
 	
 	
 		yeah
