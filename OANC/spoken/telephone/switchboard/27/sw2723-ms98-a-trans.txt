 
     		
 	
 		about how many calls have you made on this system
 	
 	
 		uh i've originated only a a few
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've received quite a few
 	
 	
 		i uh i only started doing it after uh i started getting calls and said oh heck that's right i'm supposed to make a few calls so i started
 		about month ago and i this is getting close to twenty here which i think is about all
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh our little gift book goes up to but i don't really know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i've got about twelve tickets in the mail do you have you've  a few
 	
 	
 		yeah i've been getting mine
 	
 	
 		okay uh medical go ahead i'm i'm medical that's mine
 	
 	
 		uh you pushed the record button we're supposed to be discussing the subject
 	
 	
 		yeah i i'm benefits go ahead you first
 	
 	
 		yeah uh well i'll tell you i've
 		been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies and uh it's hard to beat any of the benefits that or salaries either
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that we get from TI i'm quite pleased with it
 		course there's a few things that uh i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the CEO's seat but um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i think Jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes
 	
 	
 		the one it's kind of like uh automobile insurance the ones uh that i think are the highest and important to me
 		uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although i've used medical a little bit uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that well that one certainly is high i i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		then salary salary salary continuance i've never used that one i hope i never will but that's kind of like an insurance thing i sure like that one
 	
 	
 		well
 		ah yes
 	
 	
 		that's like automobile insurance you never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well uh
 		like i say i worked for several different companies and there's nothing to compare with uh TI here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now i really got caught up back in eighty five i got caught up in the oil layoff
 		uh i wasn't with GSI but i was connected with uh
 		uh oil
 		uh exploration
 	
 	
 		right
 		with TI or somebody else
 	
 	
 		no with TI
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i say i wasn't connected with GSI
 	
 	
 		oh right yeah
 	
 	
 		and i got caught up in a layoff now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh course you get six months
 		uh unemployment from the state
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but what TI did for us is is uh i i've never heard of it before
 		they fixed us up with an office with uh telephones access to long distance
 		uh computers
 		a secretary to take messages for us or type uh letters for us
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh they had out of town newspapers
 		and then the company
 	
 	
 		and outside consultants didn't they have an outside consultant too
 	
 	
 		i beg your pardon
 	
 	
 		did they have an outside consultant like a
 	
 	
 		uh yes they they did have uh seminars every once in a while
 	
 	
 		the employee
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh cause that was not uh restricted just to just us
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but the most important thing was that uh they had
 		made up the difference between
 		uh unemployment pay and seventy five percent of my net pay
 		and they then TI paid me that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so uh i was able to uh not just exist i mean i i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off
 	
 	
 		yeah they seem to be doing doing a good job of that i'm in facilities and and our organization built builds those facilities over in Park Central now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i guess they've been using them for six months now and i've known several engineers that got laid off and they said
 		it's like getting a PhD almost they the much they learn over there you know after they've been laid off uh one engineer said it was really an education he he just learned like you he said
 		he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too
 	
 	
 		well this was not a learning thing by any means it was just a uh
 		uh an assistance trying to find another job
 	
 	
 		to have an office yeah
 		yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a PhD in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months he did eventually get a job
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		well course i went through this uh what about five years ago they may have improved it considerably
 	
 	
 		yeah apparently it's very sophisticated and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyone's doing
 	
 	
 		well that's one of those little uh
 		uh little extras that you don't see in the uh the the the handbook you know
 	
 	
 		right you're absolutely right that's a good one
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		what do you think about pensions anything on that or
 	
 	
 		well now i have uh uh i'm getting close to retirement
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and of course i've been looking into it but uh
 		since i'm only a yellow badger i won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from TI as far as retirement is concerned
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a 401K account i i've been thinking about that for years uh
 	
 	
 		i've never heard of such a thing
 	
 	
 		i know that's what i'm saying that that pensions you see just like you were you're saying you've only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after you're vested
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then just add the money together like you do with a 401K account you know
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it's your account period it doesn't matter where you go or anything that's your account to roll over
 	
 	
 		i that that sounds like a hell of an idea i didn't know there was such a thing
 	
 	
 		no no there isn't i i'm saying that's the question what do you think could be better and i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will
 		i think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose you work for a company seven years
 	
 	
 		yes by all means well what would be the difference between that and social security
 	
 	
 		uh well social security's going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and it's not paid for by the current
 		like when say we retire after the year two thousand
 		social security's paid for by the twenty five year olds you know they may rebel
 		and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it it's there you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's just a thought i mean i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh no i i like the idea course that's that's some something like an IRA
 	
 	
 		if they say which
 		yeah
 		yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i don't really know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i i can see where they'd need to do something on that because
 		the statistics are you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know
 		you work for five six seven and you you a lot of people i know guys
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's what i've done i i've bounced around about every ten years i change
 	
 	
 		yeah i have too but not not quite that often but uh yeah i've only got uh
 		i've got fourteen now here at TI and i hope to make twenty five but say if something happened to me i mean
 		you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i do worry about medical though again knock wood that uh
 		i haven't used it i guess you i'm sorry you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that i mean i but i'm not i'm talking about major items i haven't used it for anything major
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm glad it's there though
 	
 	
 		well knock wood i haven't used mine anything for anything major just doctor visits and
 		well i i have the uh the Homa i use Homa
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i like that uh a lot better than Aetna
 	
 	
 		i have the regular i again i just i haven't i can't complain about it because i haven't used it and every time i needed it it it  it's uh you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		fallen right in line for the the minor things i guess i'm the one just supporting most of the others
 	
 	
 		well doesn't it work you don't see uh uh anything until you spend the minimum
 		don't you have to spend the minimum of two three hundred
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah i think it's two seventy five for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well now i have the same dental you have
 	
 	
 		okay yeah the medical you have to have a deductible
 	
 	
 		uh-huh now see i don't have a deductible
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		i pay a straight five dollars for anything a doctor visit or drugs
 	
 	
 		well drugs are okay now i'm on that uh
 		plan where i take blood pressure medicine if you take an allergy medicine so anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks they just raised it to twelve
 	
 	
 		oh that one i haven't heard about
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a typical that's a typical one that's in there
 		the forms are right in personnel
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		fact you may be able to take care of take advantage of that it's through Baxter Labs
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i have high blood pressure problems myself
 	
 	
 		well maybe you still can do that do you do you buy your pills one at a time
 	
 	
 		every thirty days at a time
 	
 	
 		well turn turn in your forms go right to personnel i don't know whether you have to about an HMO i don't think so
 		you turn you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription
 		and uh they're twelve dollars again they just were six they just raised them to twelve this year
 		twelve dollars for a three months supply
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		or whatever whatever the the amount is uh i don't want to say three months but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's a lot cheaper allergy medicine's really uh expensive and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive i take two
 		go right to personnel they got the forms in personnel and maybe i maybe i've told you go something you didn't know about in benefits there
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 		yeah i just might do that
 	
 	
 		i do it yeah i you know it's a very common thing
 		it's through Baxter Labs tell yeah
 	
 	
 		well thanks thanks for the tip Jim i i shall look into it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what else i'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh let's see we discussed uh uh medical and dental
 	
 	
 		what other benefits
 	
 	
 		uh retirement
 	
 	
 		yeah the salary continuation i think that's a great one but again a hope i never use that one that means you're really sick if you have to use that one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		what about vacation
 	
 	
 		i'm satisfied with the vacation i don't know what else you know you nice to say you get another week
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and when i'm well i only got fourteen years so i'll get another week when i hit fifteen
 	
 	
 		uh yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		so that's that's fair i mean it's reasonable if four weeks is a lot i think
 		i know some people who have twenty five years and thirty and they want more but uh you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well i'm uh i'm here i've got just eleven years
 		and i don't think i'll ever see a a silver badge i won't i won't be around that long
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well the way things go i think i'm going to have to work till i'm seventy five whether i quit and uh uh or when i retire get a part-time job
