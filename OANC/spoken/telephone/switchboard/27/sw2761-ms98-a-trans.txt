 
     		
 	
 		okay
 		what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful
 	
 	
 		
 
 		have a big family i guess that's a start
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i guess so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have you had any in the last how well how old are you
 	
 	
 		twenty five so i just got married
 	
 	
 		okay so
 		you have you have been to some family reunions perhaps
 	
 	
 		right every four years on one side of my family they plan on having um like my parents grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids
 	
 	
 		now how long in advance do they uh let them know
 	
 	
 		well we plan on it it's like the third weekend in August so it's every four years and so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so they all know it
 	
 	
 		yeah and then you know arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know
 		um food and whose whose staying where because a lot of people from are from down here in Texas and uh a lot of my family is in Indiana that's where i'm originally from
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so um  we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the um at the lake and uh make a couple days of it
 	
 	
 		well that sounds like fun do they all have the small children too that come
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty much
 	
 	
 		so all ages
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh
 		
 
 		you know there's some my age and then there are some a lot younger an about four generations i guess
 	
 	
 		well my husband has uh on one side has an extended family
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they don't ever plan it like as like you do i think if you can count on it every four years then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		people have it in mind so they have to start talking about it or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody because they're rather socially active too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so it has it seems that by doing it about six months ahead they can pretty much get everybody there
 		if they don't you know they'll say oh we're planning to go so and so that go to to a certain place that weekend with somebody else and we're already locked in
 		but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my family uh my parents are the youngest of very large families
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		therefore they don't have many people left
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the few previous ones i've had uh i haven't known many of those people but uh in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family
 		and that's been very nice with uh i have one sister and three brothers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they're only three out of five of us who have children
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so uh we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other and that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they don't see each other very often we don't really know many of them
 	
 	
 		yeah that's kind of bad
 	
 	
 		it really is they're fun they're a lot of fun but uh still uh they're not done on a regular basis
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you kind of forget what happened  and who they were from the time before
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's it's fun getting together with immediate family a lot of my cousins are real close and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that so
 	
 	
 		uh those are the ones that are in Texas
 	
 	
 		um no the ones in Indiana uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or you go to Indiana on that
 		uh-huh where in Indiana
 	
 	
 		Lafayette
 	
 	
 		Lafayette i don't know where i used to live in Indianapolis
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a little north of Indianapolis about an hour
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's very pretty country in there i think it's gorgeous
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so
 	
 	
 		well i uh when is your next one uh scheduled now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well it's like the last one was my high school graduation the next one was when i graduated from college so i guess about two more years
 	
 	
 		yes well and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh maybe i don't know two more years i don't know probably
 	
 	
 		maybe
 		
 
 		i mean you need another milestone you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess that's that's what i mean i've been married now for about nine months so that was another milestone i guess
 	
 	
 		yes well i'm sure and have then all of your family probably has not met your husband
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um yeah he's from Indiana so they all met yeah
