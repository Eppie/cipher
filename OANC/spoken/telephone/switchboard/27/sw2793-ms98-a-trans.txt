 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh you know i when i was much younger uh than i am now i i had wanted to go to the Peace Corps
 		and uh
 		seems like i it it was something that i i really wanted wanted to do
 	
 	
 		can you speak up please
 	
 	
 		seems like wanting to go to the Peace Corps was something that i had really wanted to do when i was young
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't believe they accept you after you you know after you're married and you have uh kids and all that so i got into that and i wasn't able to
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		to uh participate
 	
 	
 		but
 		they will accept you later in life also
 	
 	
 		oh they will
 	
 	
 		yeah after your children are grown
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		then there's no age limit
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		your kidding
 	
 	
 		no i'm not some of the people that have
 		been involved with Peace Corps among other things were retired teachers
 		uh there was a retired plumber that went to uh
 		uh Uruguay i think and helped them quite a bit with
 		concepts in plumbing you know providing for a
 		for better public hygiene
 	
 	
 		goodness i'm surprised i really had no idea
 	
 	
 		yeah but
 		so do you think that
 		people should be required to
 		give a couple years for the good of the country
 	
 	
 		well
 		i don't i don't really think that they should they should be it should be mandatory i mean
 	
 	
 		why
 	
 	
 		well
 		i don't know i it's that just might not be something that everybody wants to do i mean there are a lot of people who would like to do it and there are a lot of people who get into other things and they get all involved and they just
 		you know
 		don't want to or don't have the time
 	
 	
 		well i understand but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our
 		seventeenth and uh
 		twenty sixth birthday to give a year or two to the to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or
 		the Peace Corps or
 		something you know the military service or something
 		wouldn't we have uh
 		maybe a better class of Americans
 	
 	
 		i don't see how that can can
 		make a better class of Americans to make everybody
 		to make it mandatory for everybody to participate
 	
 	
 		a lot of these people a lot of our uh
 		pardon the terminology but yuppies now
 		are interested in one thing and one thing only and that's themselves
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		well
 		i don't i don't think that
 	
 	
 		and at least if you legislated
 		giving
 		for a couple years of their lives
 		or or uh
 		a
 		actually purely giving but but some sort of equitable exchange then at least
 		the country would have gotten two years from them
 		where
 		hum
 		they would have given something to the country instead of take taking
 		away all their lives
 	
 	
 		yeah are are you suggesting then that if if uh if i have to go and and do something for the country for two years
 		that the country will compensate me in some way
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i i will be compensated for this i'm not just going to
 	
 	
 		give them your time give them your entire life for two years no
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it will be a job of sorts i'm sure that
 		the Peace Corps pays it doesn't pay well it's not top wages
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		but it does pay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the military
 		for young hiring in soldiers
 		does pay it doesn't pay well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		okay currently in our country
 		especially in some regions
 		there's an employment problem
 	
 	
 		that that that's true but in even in our region there's an employment problem  there's a lot of uh
 	
 	
 		you're aware of that i'm sure
 	
 	
 		people gotten laid off lately you know from  companies like General Dynamics and Texas Instruments
 	
 	
 		and Texas Instruments
 	
 	
 		thousands and thousands of people are out there looking for jobs
 	
 	
 		you know in in another time we had the WPA
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		Works Progress Administration
 	
 	
 		i'm not familiar with that
 	
 	
 		during the great depression
 	
 	
 		oh i
 	
 	
 		though i can't see why it was great
 		uh
 		that
 		gave people
 		pay that was
 		halfway between relief
 		which was welfare
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		the minimum wage
 	
 	
 		i see
 		and that was
 		that was some  some some program where people gave their time
 	
 	
 		in trade for
 	
 	
 		in trade for
 	
 	
 		money
 	
 	
 		some money okay
 	
 	
 		and
 		and living
 		they gave them food and uniforms and
 		uh here in Colorado you'll find
 		a great many things
 		public roads that were worked on by the WPA uh
 		dams that were built by the WPA
 		uh scenic overlooks
 		parks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we are road our road system's falling apart
 		our  our national road system system of highways
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and roads is falling apart
 	
 	
 		well then i guess there are a lot of a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country
 	
 	
 		there there's a lot of work to be done
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i really i really don't see anything wrong with it i just don't think that it should be mandatory that every person have to do that
 	
 	
 		i
 		i can't see the problem in it for a year
 		the
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		what what i'm saying is that
 		if it were mandatory
 		that every person
 		right after graduation from high school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that were able bodied
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		would give a year
 		well or not give a year but
 		but trade a year
 		then they at least one not more than say three or four
 		then
 		it would definitely effect unemployment
 	
 	
 		all right i wonder if if they didn't make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering to to to do it that it you know that they would have enough
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		i mean i
 		i probably
 	
 	
 		well you know Texas
 		New Mexico Colorado
 		huge numbers of other western states have no real welfare system
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		there's Aid to Dependent Children
 		and Aid to Mothers of Dependent Children but there's no real welfare system
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but if we took these people off
 		off the streets for a year
 		there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else
 		and who knows maybe
 		some of our graduating high school seniors might
 		would find out
 		a little bit more the
 		what the traditional American work ethic means
 		you know we have had some problem with that in recent years
 	
 	
 		oh well yes we have with with uh
 		recent generations i i know exactly what you are talking about i i mean i know several people who do not wish wish to work
 	
 	
 		uh they wish only for the paycheck
 	
 	
 		well they wish for the money and they they decide that they're going to get the money anyway they can with you know without
 		uh without without working in the the traditional American
 	
 	
 		really producing
 	
 	
 		job market
 	
 	
 		yeah be it selling drugs or whatever
 	
 	
 		right
 		so what i'm saying they they get the money anyway they can
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		and
 		maybe if we
 		instilled
 		the work ethic
 		you know i enjoy the i enjoy working
 	
 	
 		yeah
