 
     		
 	
 		uh so i uh weight train uh three days on and one day off
 	
 	
 		uh so what do you do to exercise
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i uh ride bicycles  um fifteen twenty miles
 		i don't know maybe three times maybe four times a week i play basketball uh couple times a week i play softball one night a week
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh that's what i do what about yourself
 	
 	
 		hm that's pretty impressive um  i guess i bicycle uh the amount varies as much as a hundred fifty miles a week um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i guess i play softball one night a week and i backpack a lot over the summer
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's about the extent of it i mean i don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise
 		but um i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise um but i do it mostly for fun
 	
 	
 		yeah what um what do you ride uh like bunch of hills or flat pretty flat
 	
 	
 		it it it varies uh out near my house is pretty hilly um but sometimes i bike to work which is about um a fifteen mile trip each way and that's mostly flat
 	
 	
 		how long does that take you to get to work
 	
 	
 		about forty five fifty minutes
 	
 	
 		how does how does that work work out with uh storing your bike and showering and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah it can be a pain um
 		basically uh i work on a campus so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there uh but it's it's enough of a pain that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i did it consistently one year i would commute everyday um
 		but it just became such a pain i mean we were talking you know forty five or fifty minutes for biking um and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff it was a big hunk of well hunk of the day um and then of course another hour to get back home um
 		so i've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends
 	
 	
 		yeah do you ride a lot of rallies are lot of those around there
 	
 	
 		not so much um
 		i guess mostly i bike on my own i've got a touring bike
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um though i haven't gone on any extended trips with it how about you what kind of biking do you do
 	
 	
 		uh well actually my wife just got me into it and i did a did an internship at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas at Cooper Clinic and i learned all the health benefits of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i you know i was a solid weight trainer and all i did was weights and anaerobic exercise and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise said you really need to do it so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		once i got into this uh internship i learned all the physiological advantages advantages
 		advantages to it so i began a program couple i don't know probably three or four weeks ago and i did my first bike rally  this Saturday i did uh forty forty miles
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh that's the longest i've ever ridden so far i usually you know fifteen or twenty  and it was it was kind of hilly and it was pretty tough but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i'm looking at uh doing a lot more of it because you know my wife is really into it and i i kind of
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		held her back a little bit this this weekend she wanted to go go go but you know she wanted to stay with me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it's good to have a partner
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is
 	
 	
 		are you you thinking of doing any like centuries or
 	
 	
 		yeah that'd be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i just wondered if you're were gonna do that mostly or more like you know uh um
 		uh touring like from Vermont or you know that kind of thing i mean people seem to get into different aspects one is more of a distance and one's more just you know they wanna
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour
 	
 	
 		i've never really looked into that that you know that's my wife would just love that and i may do that sometime there again i'm just kind of a fledgling into this
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've it's kind of funny i'd called this number and i just reading through a a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up i mean around Texas you got
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you got about five or six different if you live around the Dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from because they're really into it
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 		hm
 	
 	
 		bicycling's really big here i didn't know that and you know till i came down here and just kind of caught the fever  because i lived in Indiana all my life and
 	
 	
 		wow yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you may say one see one or two guys on a bicycle that are above the age of fifteen or something but other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i'm not sure why that is i mean generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less i mean maybe it's because of the winters
 	
 	
 		probably
 	
 	
 		uh or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and  there's a lot of bikers around here it's it's really neat
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there are a lot of a lot of resources lot of magazines and stuff little Texas Bicyclist is like a newspaper that comes out every month
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and it's free you just go to the bike shock bike bike shop and pick it up and it's got all the rides coming up so i guess i'm gonna be busy about every Saturday this summer going to a different ride yeah see a little bit of Texas i've never seen before
 	
 	
 		oh that's terrific
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh how long have you been biking
 	
 	
 		oh i guess
 		as an adult for just about the past uh three years or so
 		um
 		you know i guess the last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago and uh yeah i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		until i suddenly disevered all my friends were basically biking a lot  and so i thought i'd try it too
 	
 	
 		have you ever had a uh it's kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a uh a blood work up done recently or since you been biking to see if it because it really
 	
 	
 		no i haven't no
 	
 	
 		from what i understand it really improves your uh cholesterol and and you know it uh it kind of knocks you down two uh the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh low cardiovascular fitness and also uh you know the cholesterol it gives you uh increased HDLs and decreases your LDLs yeah so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's great yeah i've i've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse you know it gets it down to about forty yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you say you ride about a hundred hundred fifty miles a week man that's that's hard core when do you get to begin with the winters and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		on average yeah
 	
 	
 		or what time of the year do you usually embark on your do you ride inside if you can't ride outside
 	
 	
 		no i'm not that hard-core i mean there are some people in fact there are a lot of people who'll ride outside in the snow they've got a uh mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't do that i basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter uh-hum i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because it'll help your balance when you're indoor training
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um but but i just you know more or less stuck to like an exercise bike and that kind of thing um
 		but yeah i mean winters are kind of a problem so i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um but you know up here it's  it's only stopped snowing since then uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah it's it's it's it's pretty good it's uh the main
 		the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore i'll lay off of it more
 	
 	
 		right
 		so you uh change up your routes a lot and keep a
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i try to go someplace pretty different you know every week i rotate around um about four different routes
 		um from my house or i'll sometimes come in to school it's nice coming it's nice it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path
 		um because it's just it's along the Erie Canal up here  uh University of Rochester
 	
 	
 		so what school is it
 		oh okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's fairly picturesque and uh so it's it's it's a good ride as long as you're not doing it everyday it's a good ride
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true sounds neat it's kind of i was wondering if i was gonna
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week that's something motivating
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's really good
 		well
 	
 	
 		well it was good talking to you
 	
 	
 		good talking to you and keep up the good work all right take care bye
 	
 	
 		okay you too
 		bye
