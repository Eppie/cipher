 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		i will i guess i will start and say that i keep up uh with current events
 		mostly from three or four areas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'll tell you what they are and uh then you uh would you please uh tell me how you do it
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i think i keep up better with what's going on in the world from the newspaper but i usually am introduced to subjects by television
 	
 	
 		and then if something that struck your fancy then you pay attention more to that kind of topic then when you get the newspaper
 	
 	
 		exactly in more detail
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i also take uh Time magazine and i enjoy that a lot and uh i get a lot of uh i think pretty good detail there
 		and uh i'm pretty i'm pretty satisfied with i think those and some friends who are who are very knowledgeable
 	
 	
 		um-hum yes
 	
 	
 		and how how do you
 	
 	
 		well basically the same thing i i know uh my husband's favorite radio station in all the world is KRLD
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he we wake up to KRLD we go to sleep at night to KRLD and i used to just really argue about that and battle that and i don't so much anymore because
 		i do want to keep up and know what's going on and
 		it helps i don't often uh have time to sit down and watch the evening news kind of thing but
 		if i'm around during the daytime and have a chance i'll switch on CNN
 		always have watched CNN ever since we
 		got the cable
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh you know coverage that provided for that and have always enjoyed it and am glad to see them getting a little uh boost these days since the uh war a little more uh recognition and credibility
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i've i uh
 		have access to Time and Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal all of which i
 		rely on more i think than what i get over network
 		TV news
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and like you you know knowledgeable friends i work for a fellow who is uh in the oil industry internationally
 		and travels a lot to third world countries and all around and i feel like a lot of times what we get from his contacts is far more valid
 	
 	
 		wonderful
 	
 	
 		then you know but that's only in a real specialized area you know that's not that's just political it's not the medical arena it's not technology particularly although sometimes it overlaps
 	
 	
 		of course
 		
 
 	
 	
 		into those kinds of things but i don't think i would be satisfied if all i had was just television
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		you know the uh the newspapers i think
 		you know they uh i think a lot of the meat of what i get out  out of the  newspaper's not on the front page
 	
 	
 		i think that's right too well especially The Wall Street Journal
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i uh
 		i have really enjoyed being able to have access to that the last couple of years it uh
 	
 	
 		don't you find though that it's hard to find time
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		to yeah to the reading is The Wall Street Journal if i don't read it the day that it comes in then if they start piling up on me then i have to just forget about about it usually
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum um-hum
 		well and you know you just take a a newspaper just your your regular daily average big city newspaper
 		there's more information in one
 		than an entire month magazine you know monthly periodical
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and
 		a lot of times i'll just take the whole thing soon as i get it and i take out the sections i want trash the rest otherwise you like you say the the stack of paper is so large
 		
 
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		it's unmanageable just in your home situation
 	
 	
 		it really is and especially if you're trying to
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		save papers for recycling
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		just terrible job
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh i think i enjoy uh Time and i i get Insight and i don't like that magazine very much
 	
 	
 		i i'm not familiar with that one
 	
 	
 		it looks like a little Time
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it is not written as well as Time staff uh writers do
 		but i i like some of those magazines because they just choose certain subjects i guess
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and deal with a
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well i'm a nonfiction oriented kind of person anyway oh i enjoy a good novel
 		but you know given the choice in the doctor's office when they're all lined up i'm much more apt to grab the
 		Time or Newsweek or US News and World Reports than i ever would People or
 		McCall's or although i've you know i read those kinds of things too occasionally and and and find things that are current and
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		updated but i don't know i just just my particular
 		predisposition i
 		i tend more the other way so i try not to ever find myself in a situation without something to read because my reading time comes in
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right
 	
 	
 		little snatches  i have five kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so by the time i get around to
 		actually reading i have you know i may have ten or fifteen minutes of slot
 		to read so
 	
 	
 		i guess you have five children well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well they're good kids
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh well of course
 	
 	
 		and this you know this is another reason though i think that ah
 		makes me real aware and encouraging because i know there's always a a a tidbit of information that's going to come across some
 		i'm either gonna read it or i'm gonna hear it that they can turn right around and use in a report
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		so if i hear a statistic that's interesting or whatnot even just driving in the car i'll make a little note and uh
 		you know of where that came from and the time i heard it and whatnot so they can use that in a bibliography
 	
 	
 		well you are passing good information on to them aren't you
 	
 	
 		i hope so i hope so i think kids tend to watch news for the sensationalism
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my kids love to watch the news but it's not always you know you wonder if it's for the right reason
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right
 	
 	
 		not just the gore
 	
 	
 		they've heard it though
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but i think it's a good habit to
 	
 	
 		sure it is
 	
 	
 		to establish uh
 	
 	
 		it has been nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		thank you so much and uh
 	
 	
 		enjoyed it a great deal
 	
 	
 		i'll uh just be anxious to tell my daughter's friend that there's a nice lady out there
 	
 	
 		there really is  it's beautiful
 	
 	
 		and that there's she's not falling off the face of the earth
 	
 	
 		it really is beautiful you will enjoy i know she will enjoy it
 	
 	
 		well my daughter hopes to come visit before too long so we're uh we're anxious to point that way sometime take care and have a good day
 	
 	
 		oh
 		good
 		thank you you too
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
