 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you have any favorite restaurants in the area
 	
 	
 		oh yes i love uh Mexican and uh Oriental foods
 	
 	
 		oh okay sounds great
 	
 	
 		both so uh i could say Enchiladas down on Greenville Avenue in Dallas Texas
 	
 	
 		i've been there
 	
 	
 		is uh a real good Mexican
 		and we like uh stir fry Hunan style over in Addison
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		have you ever tried the Blue Goose on Greenville Avenue
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i enjoy
 	
 	
 		they serve a lot of food
 	
 	
 		and good food in the Blue Goose yeah that is a good place where do you like to eat
 	
 	
 		i usually go to El Chico once a week for lunch Thursdays Fridays whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		favorite spot
 	
 	
 		and uh China Market in uh Keystone
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah that's good what what other kind of food interesting
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh i like just about everything uh sandwich shops uh Schlotzky's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		restaurants that have a variety of food like uh Chili's or Bennigan's TGI Friday's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		Schlotzky's is probably my favorite deli deli sandwich i guess because of the bread the uh roll
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i go to Galligaskins' too quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah Schlotzky's is unique as they say different is better
 	
 	
 		sounds good
 		that's true that is true
 	
 	
 		do you typically go out uh for lunch or for dinner
 	
 	
 		well both uh probably eat out for dinner say once or twice a week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i eat out for lunch probably three times a week
 	
 	
 		yeah i usually hit the favorite lunch spots uh every week uh being El Chico and China Market
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		sometimes Schlotzky's uh
 		places like that during during lunch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't get out too much on the weekends but uh i'll occasionally go to an Italian restaurant or a Chinese restaurant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh there is a new Italian restaurant that is really good
 		uh on Greenville it's uh La Fontana or something like that it's right after you cross uh six thirty five on Greenville
 	
 	
 		okay i've never been there
 	
 	
 		it is actually the family has not been here even a year in the states
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's real authentic Italian food and their deserts are fabulous so if you like Italian that that's a really good place to go
 	
 	
 		yeah i live up in Plano so i usually go to some place like uh A Taste of Italy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i haven't tried that is is it good
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i think it's good it's uh
 	
 	
 		because i live in Plano too
 	
 	
 		okay i've been to uh Primavera also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i like that it's a little smaller and they don't have as large uh uh smoking a nonsmoking section to put it that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh so it it and it it gets gets quite crowded at at uh times especially on weekends
 	
 	
 		yeah that means a lot to me too nonsmoking
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		um
 		let's see what was
 		uh what about steaks
 	
 	
 		steak oh yeah they opened up the Hoffbrau here about uh what two years ago in Plano
 	
 	
 		where you use for a good steak
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that's very good i take uh some some of my relatives there aunts and uncles a couple months ago to the Hoffbrau and they're dairy farmers so they're real picky about their steak but they were impressed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh well that's good because i i know Steak and Ale is
 		a favorite prime rib that they have is is usually what i get and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i was real pleased now i haven't had prime rib at the Hoffbrau but
 	
 	
 		they don't i don't think they serve prime rib it's mostly just a steak shop uh Steak and Ale's a little more upscale than Hoffbrau
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the Hoffbrau's kind of neat in that they've got uh that market there too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and those uh shops with all the crafts so while you're waiting for uh for a seat you get to kind uh to browse around and see what what they've got in the farmer's market
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah and from what i understand i know on the weekends passing there they have quite a wait
 	
 	
 		they've got a wait even on weeknights uh usually between a half hour and forty five minutes
 	
 	
 		well you
 		really
 		um
 	
 	
 		so uh and it starts uh anywhere from from five o'clock on
 	
 	
 		well what about fast food what do you grab you know say what's your favorite hamburger Wendy's
 	
 	
 		as far as burgers uh yeah i like Wendy's
 		uh i do not care for Burger King
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i cannot eat their Whoppers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh McDonald's i avoid
 		i used to work there as a teenager
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh once you've worked in a place like that uh oh i don't know you don't i'm kind of reluctant to go back
 	
 	
 		yeah i can understand that
 	
 	
 		i know how the food is prepared
 	
 	
 		yeah well i don't know Wendy's i think Wendy's tries to be more of a homemade burger so
 		it's to me it's probably a little bit better you know an
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		maybe it's an adult hamburger
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah uh Arby's is good too except i don't care for the roast beef the chicken is good
 	
 	
 		place
 		uh-huh uh-huh well i like just about any kind of food i can usually i can eat anything any at anytime so usually whatever my friends want to go eat it suits me just fine an
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		they're opening up a new restaurant in about a month uh in Keystone called Razzoo's it's going to be a Cajun restaurant
 	
 	
 		oh
 		is that where the Flamingo was okay i noticed they were redoing that
 	
 	
 		right same building
 		Flang Flamingo used to be the Cactus before that
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		but the Flamingo never quite made it i went there one time an was not impressed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i've never been there now this new one is Razzoo's
 	
 	
 		Razzoo's
 	
 	
 		oh Cajun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well is that a chain or
 	
 	
 		i don't think so um it it looks brand new in fact we stopped by one time at lunch to uh talk to the guy who is redoing it and uh he was real excited and gung ho
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they've got their chef and their recipes all lined up and they're ready to start business
 	
 	
 		well good deal
 	
 	
 		but they're renovating the place right now it will take about another month i guess before they open up
 	
 	
 		i'll have to try that what about that Italian there have you tried that uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Eduardo's yeah i i went there a couple of times i was there for the grand opening
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a friend of mine and myself were the second and third customers he had at that the restaurant
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		but uh it's a little heavy for lunch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you get yeah too much pasta
 	
 	
 		a lot of food
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i don't really care for that type of food for lunch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so usually a sandwich uh maybe uh well El Chico once a week or once every other week something like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		soup yeah
 		yeah Super Salads is a favorite place to hit too yeah
 	
 	
 		Super Salads is good
 	
 	
 		one of those things you got to go early you know to find a seat yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah they get crowded real quick
 		the crowd's a little dressier too more of a yuppie crowd
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		let's see uh fish as far as fish i think my favorite place is uh Dinger's over over on Forest Lane
 	
 	
 		Dinger's i've never tried that okay
 	
 	
 		oh it's very good very good
 		matter of fact it's right by the TI plant that little shopping center
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it's pretty good and
 	
 	
 		yeah i stop by uh oh what's the name of this place Long John Silvers every now and then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for uh fish greasy fish
 	
 	
 		great yeah yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but every now and then you get into the mood for something like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		also in the shopping center you know where BG's uh Zaks is that little craft shopping center
 	
 	
 		yeah i sure do
 	
 	
 		there's a a home if you want just like a plate you know home cooked meal that's good it's called BG's
 		and every day they have like a plate lunch special and it's fairly cheap it's like two ninety five or three fifty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's real good
 		so
 	
 	
 		i don't think i've ever heard of that before
 	
 	
 		that's oh it's just kind of a mom and pop restaurant that's
 		uh vegetables like a couple vegetables and a meat an and roll and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		quick usually really quick too so
 	
 	
 		what do you think about Korean food
 	
 	
 		i have never tried any
 	
 	
 		there is a place called the Korean Rib on uh i think it's on Alma
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or is it on Custer
 		it's up here in Plano anyway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's very good i uh really thought it was well it's it's a lot like Chinese food
 	
 	
 		i was going to say how does it compare are the spices different
 	
 	
 		um
 		i it well they have different dishes uh it's not so much just a lot of rice with uh with something dumped on top they uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh they've they've got more type uh specialty type uh meals i guess you'd say
 	
 	
 		oh okay more like an entree
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		and and vegetable
 	
 	
 		uh-huh something like that yeah
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		i've also tried uh a Korean restaurant in Dallas

 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh she i've never got the courage to go but
 		that's once a week place for her

 		i used to eat the Mexican food but i lost the taste for that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah the burrito you can only handle every so often
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sandwiches are okay but there are better places to go the prices are not that cheap at the cafeteria
