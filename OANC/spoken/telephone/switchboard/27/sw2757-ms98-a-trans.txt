 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay  uh where do you stand on gun control
 	
 	
 		was a loud one
 		i'm against it
 	
 	
 		again your a one then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i i uh your against gun control why why
 	
 	
 		yes
 		you you can't enforce the laws you got why do you want to pass some more
 	
 	
 		that's a good that's a very good point very good point i personally
 		i guess i would be a five they said pick a one to ten
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh because i i'm i think i'm dead smack in the middle i think that
 		if there is going to be a ban on gun control that it should be enforced like you said and i feel like if there if if there is a band
 		put upon us it wouldn't be a forced enforced just like um there's suppose to be working on a drug problem suppose be working on our education problems
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		things like that and those aren't being enforced but at the same time i want to see people protect themselves because things like the drug
 		the drug war is not is not helping and i feel like i have to protect myself when i go out somewhere because there's so many people they're crazy people out there
 	
 	
 		that's correct i don't know how maybe that's i agree one hundred percent i just uh what irritates me i guess is that they keep wanting to pass gun control laws that do nothing but take away your your constitutional amendments
 	
 	
 		you know and so
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that is that is really not gun control is not the problem
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's the people using the guns
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and all they're doing is look at this new Brady Bill
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the seven day waiting period that does not deter anybody who really that wants to buy a gun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		there's spots here in Austin
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		on Sixth Street to Eleventh east east of the interstate
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you stand in an alley down there and buy anything you want
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		i mean you know and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		whether you want guns drugs women anything uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah it's just it's just like the drugs i mean they're legal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you can get them anywhere if you want you can get it
 	
 	
 		true
 		you can make two phone calls if you know if you know anybody here in town uh
 		you can make two phone calls and have automatic weapons
 	
 	
 		uh that is a shame
 	
 	
 		the law's just you know it's
 		they can't enforce what they have you know and i'm not a big fan of Peter Jennings peculiarly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he was on one of the on the talk shows one time they had Kennedy on there and Brady Mrs Gonzalez and some of the other liberals but you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he he pulled this big stack of papers out that was about oh four feet tall and he said these are all the current gun laws you have the books if you can't enforce these why do you think you can pass another one and enforce it
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		the Brady Bill won't do anything but just make it harder for the people that are honest to buy one those those that are criminals which are the ones that are refusing guns in the first place uh they're not going to walk in and buy one anyway
 	
 	
 		the reason i think i'm so cloudy on the issue is because i mean it it i want to protect myself but at the same time i don't want anyone to have a gun that could harm me
 		you know what i'm saying
 	
 	
 		well uh the uh proper solution is education of the masses
 	
 	
 		and so
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you've got to educate the people in in using the weapons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and you know our forefathers you know everybody carried a gun here in Texas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know for you know a couple of hundred years
 	
 	
 		right but everyone weren't they weren't going around killing each other
 	
 	
 		that's true unless of course there was you know
 	
 	
 		trouble yeah
 	
 	
 		sufficient sufficient provocation which we have basically the same something now it's just that all the honest people you know the citizens as it were no longer carry guns to defend themselves because only only the criminals are
 	
 	
 		but do you think more and more people now are carrying guns and weapons
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean just to i'm talking about the regular like
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh i have a class license
 	
 	
 		Joe Blow on the street
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for firearms and a friend of mine owns a gun shop in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i go up and help him you know work in the store and stuff like that and it it's amazing the number of people that are buying guns and the reason they're buying them is they want to give their wife one to carry in the car with them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that some of the woman will come in and they'll look around and they'll try and find a small one to fit inside their purse
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 		i mean you you have to because i i mean i don't have a gun it just scares me to have one but i feel like that very soon i'm going to have to get one just because i would probably feel safer
 	
 	
 		and
 		well if you get one you know
 	
 	
 		right now i have a knife under the seat in my car
 		uh if i'm going anywhere at night anywhere i mean if i'm just stepping outside my door i carry something on me if i'm you know going up to my door and i don't have anything i put my keys in some kind of weapon like position in my hand you know
 	
 	
 		you're single i take it
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		are you single i take it
 	
 	
 		yes yes i am i have a boyfriend but you know he's not always around
 	
 	
 		yeah okay
 		yeah
 		well my wife uh before we got married uh she didn't carry any sort of thing and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i've got uh
 		i've acquired you know her you know bought several that i give her to carry one of them she carries in her purse
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there's some in the car i i always have one in my truck when i'm driving any place
 	
 	
 		yes my boyfriend that that got me you know put the knives here and there and you know just different things and
 	
 	
 		you know knives or mace or something but uh you know
 	
 	
 		yeah and i have mace on my key chain i mean i have a lot of you know little things that
 		but i don't i don't like to have to carry them you know uh but you have to
 	
 	
 		well it's a sad state of affairs when have to but uh you know they're are more and more homes getting broken into and everybody says well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh it's because of guns no it's not because of the guns it's because of the people and and actually they're breaking in
 	
 	
 		no no
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		to the homes and and using weapons to buy drugs although you do have those that you know like the idiot who ran out and grabbed that AK-47 and shot everybody up at the McDonald's in Calif ornia
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		uh-huh uh-huh now that's just
 	
 	
 		you know that we're talking about somebody whose crazy having a gun law is not going to stop him because he's going to find one
 	
 	
 		lunacy that's
 		yeah
 		he'll find some other way whether it's a gun or bomb or what
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah well you know California
 		California Hawaii and New York state have these and uh
 		now New Jersey had the stiffest gun laws
 	
 	
 		oh do they
 	
 	
 		oh yeah but you know where where are the most crimes committed New York state
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as you know uh John Lennon was you know you know was shot and killed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in uh New York by a guy that bought a gun in Hawaii which has a tough gun law
 	
 	
 		uh uh uh
 	
 	
 		and you know i mean this clown out in uh California he uh had a criminal record you know a mile long
 	
 	
 		and still got a gun
 	
 	
 		but he still had not one but several
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there was one not too long ago but in the last six months uh
 		he shot up that Allstate or or or that GMC credit place in Florida
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well he went out and bought six different guns
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		you know and he had a criminal record
 	
 	
 		and i mean if you find
 		if you offer a uh enough money to somebody they'll go get you a gun you know if your not eligible you know come to me offer me enough money i'll go get you a gun you know there's probably a lot of people like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		and there are people
 		yeah they're people doing that so i mean the the solution is not to pass more laws than you can't enforce because they're they're going to pass one now they're trying too either the Staggers Bill or the Brady Bill
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		either way they do it it's going to cost you and me more money
 	
 	
 		right and not probably going to help too much
 	
 	
 		because and and and we're going to increase the bureaucracy that's supposed to handle it and
 		what are they going to do they're going to punch your name in the computer and you're going to come up as no you're not a criminal and no and no you have no criminal record you know and yeah you can by gun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but that doesn't say that you're not going to walk outside and three days later shoot somebody
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		you know there's no substitute for people
 	
 	
 		a lot a lot of people that are in jail you know it's their first shooting or why do people you know not everybody has shot someone before
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		actually guns are not the prime uh weapon used in killing people in crimes of passion or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's knives and baseball bats
 	
 	
 		uh-huh baseball bats
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i could see knives yeah stabbings and things
 	
 	
 		see you can walk down the street carrying a baseball bat and nobody thinks anything about it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and how many times have you seen people walking down the street carrying a baseball bat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you figure what little leaguers on their way to practice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they could be gang members just as easy
 		if you
 	
 	
 		i didn't know baseball bats was like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's uh it's quite a deal
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		nobody pays attention to a baseball bat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and you you can see a baseball bat in the back of the car and nobody no cops going to give you a ticket for a baseball bat in the back of your car
 	
 	
 		that's a very deadly weapon
 	
 	
 		yeah so why you know
 	
 	
 		i mean one blow at that and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		or knives you can have knives everybody's got knives of course you're limited you know you can't have switchblades and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh you know guns are used but so is everything else
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if you're going to ban that if you're going to band guns i've got an article in the Wall Street Journal where they had where they had uh used a satire
 		where someone in New York had suggested all the guns because they were used for commission of drug regulated crimes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they immediately decided well lets start banning the public telephones
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		bless you
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		and they said well let's band the public telephones too because the public telephones are used in the commission of drug related crimes
 	
 	
 		very true
 	
 	
 		makes about as much sense
 	
 	
 		a lot of sense
 	
 	
 		but you know the to my way of thinking you know uh i'm a i'm you know i spilled blood on the ground you know for in the United States
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh if if the United States does not trust me enough to have a gun after that then i don't trust them enough to govern me
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i'm kind of radical on that i just you know
 	
 	
 		you sound like you're pretty strongly
 	
 	
 		well i i see too much of it and i see people come into the shop up there and you know and i buy guns and and they haven't got the faintest idea what you are doing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and they want to buy a gun now i think there should be some sort of ID card that you carry
 	
 	
 		right
 		what do you think about making some kind of application or something
 	
 	
 		there's an application you fill out now
 	
 	
 		do you okay
 	
 	
 		it's a yellow form
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh see that's it's just another piece of paperwork it asks for your name your address and phone number and the county where you birth and all and you know and then there's a list of ten questions you answer and
 		if you answer no to all of them that means you're a good American
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you such um seriously and
 	
 	
 		yeah uh uh uh
 	
 	
 		it's a little yellow form you fill out and it puts the name and the serial number the gun who bought it and the date like that and that stays in the gun shop and it never goes anywhere
 		it stays right there we've got boxes full in the back room
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well that's a lot of help
 	
 	
 		and and the only thing that it's used for is if uh if Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms come down and does an inspection
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they look through and if they look through and if they look through your legal logbook you have to log it down in and out well you got
 	
 	
 		and they probably really do that
 	
 	
 		and they and
 		they don't come out very often
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i've seen them once in about five years
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		but they come down once
