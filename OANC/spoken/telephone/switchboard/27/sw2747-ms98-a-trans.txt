 
     		
 	
 		okay Jim um what are they doing down in your uh neck of the woods for recycling
 	
 	
 		we have recently the city of Plano has started a a situation it's pretty much volunteer as far as separating
 		oh paper and bottles and you know cans and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it's not exactly curbside yet they've got these little igloo like things sitting up in various parts of town where you can take that stuff in if you want to
 		the biggest thing that they've done is uh for forever we had been on the plastic trash bag business where everything was just uh put in uh plastic bags then set out in the alley
 		but uh they came through with these big green uh plastic dumpster kind of things uh where you put everything except lawn trash
 		and then they  they
 		we got these uh paper sacks to put uh lawn debris and stuff in supposedly uh you know it can all be mulched at once the paper sack and everything
 		only problem is you can't get anything in the paper sack
 	
 	
 		oh that's they're they're too small
 	
 	
 		yeah they're too small on the top and they're they're smaller than most grass catchers and that sort of thing so
 		they just started this uh oh maybe a month or two ago
 		and uh
 		they uh
 		the local folks you know they're just starting to use them now that the grass is starting to you know be cut and everything we're getting a lot of complaints about them but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you know i i realize the whole the whole recycling trash thing is a is such a problem because the landfill and all that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true right
 		um
 	
 	
 		i don't know what are they
 		they're probably doing more than that up there i'm i guess you all started this sort of thing long time before we did
 	
 	
 		yeah well up  Massachusetts i i live in Rhode Island
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know i travel back and forth which isn't too far it's only i only live about uh about eight miles from the plant
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i live right up in the uh in the northeast corner of Rhode Island and and the plant is is in uh is in the like the south uh southwest section of Massachusetts it comes down like kind of a neck so
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't have for to travel but i live in a rural community and last year we started recycling they made it mandatory in in our town
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they gave you uh uh little blue containers that you put all your your uh your bottles and cans
 		and like the plastic milk jugs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you put those in there and they recycle those  and then you put your newspapers in a separate or either you put them in a a paper bag or or you tie them up with string
 		you put those in a separate bundle and they have a special truck that comes around and they pick them up curbside
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then the rest of it is just you know goes to the landfill i guess or whatever they whatever they incinerate it maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah we  uh we're coming to that here you know in the metroplex is getting big enough that um it'll happen i i grew up in a
 		uh kind of a a rural area of of west Texas and New Mexico where that just wasn't a problem matter of fact till recently we burned trash you know we had the big barrels out in in the alley
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and when it's filled up you just put a match to it and burned it well course that's that's almost unheard of anymore
 	
 	
 		and that's  right
 		that's what we used to do too years ago we used to do the same thing
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah we used to burn leaves and burn grass you know and all that
 		as far as what to uh to do to encourage recycling i guess a lot of states
 		i have noticed on uh on Coke bottles and and whatnot we went i've got some relatives in Iowa
 		and uh there's a big thing up there what is it nickel for every bottle or some such thing and you know people
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah we do the same yeah
 	
 	
 		people actively go out and and uh seek them you know i guess that's one way of doing it you know is to make it worthwhile
 	
 	
 		yeah all the states around us Connecticut uh Massachusetts New Hampshire i think Vermont and Maine do it Rhode Island's the only state that doesn't put a nickel deposit on the bottles
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but every other state does so you don't you don't see any trash along the sides of the roads people that throw bottles away there's other people that come along with plastic bags and they pick them up and and i guess they can make of a you know it's like working a part-time job
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it's all free just takes time and if you're retired and have nothing to do
 		um
 	
 	
 		well course there's uh
 		people will go after aluminum cans and stuff down here because it's just uh there's not a per can value on them but there is a
 	
 	
 		oh just on the metal content
 	
 	
 		just in the metal recycling itself i've
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i'm not sure what it's what a can is worth now it's couple cents you know you've got to get quite a few of them to really make it worthwhile but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		to make it worth it yeah
 	
 	
 		it turns out that uh on a  a Sunday morning after a Dallas Saturday night there's enough aluminum cans and stuff along the road to make it worthwhile yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		uh my wife and i both graduated from the University of Rhode Island their uh master gardener program
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess every state has has uh uh  a land grant college
 		uh would used to be Brown University now it's uh University of Rhode Island
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and what we learned down there is that uh
 		fifty percent when you when you mow your lawn fifty percent of all the nutrients are in that top section of the grass and most people kind of rake it up or they catch it in the grass catcher and they throw it away
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you if you mow properly and just let it lay in there you refertilize your own soil besides building up a base
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's what  we've been doing that for the last couple of years
 		and you don't have to worry about uh fertilizing which causes a lot of thatch and all that kind of stuff so there's more and more people too are aware of that up here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they're not going out for chemicals they're not going out for a lot of fertilizers and stuff so they're letting it you know uh
 	
 	
 		our soil situation down here in this particular area we're in a real hard black gooey gummy awful black clay situation
 	
 	
 		oh so
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		summertimes it cracks when it heats when it gets
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you could lose a small dog in the cracks  sometimes
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh so i
 	
 	
 		i was watching uh  i was watching the news this morning uh national news and they were talking about uh i guess they got a a recycling dump for tires that caught on fire
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but they were saying that uh California  they recycle their their
 		all the tires and make like a a some kind of a rubberized compound and they incorporate that with uh with uh tar and they use it on their roads and they say the roads last a lot longer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		there was a thing in the local news here yesterday there's a little town down south of Fort Worth called Mansfield and there's some tire recycling outfit wants a permit down there they say out of every tire you can get a gallon what amounts to a ga llon of diesel fuel
 		and like you say several pounds of this uh carbon black and uh material for for making roads and anymore there's a couple pounds of stainless steel
 		in most of the uh the tires yeah because the steel belted tires and uh
 	
 	
 		oh for the steel belted that's right i didn't think about
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a totally gas fired operation they say there's no exhaust whatsoever you know most people think of tire yeah tho se burning tire uh
 		see there was what was it Massachusetts i remember here a couple of years ago reading about one that had been on fire for  long period of time you know it just smolders and the black smoke pours out of it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		there could be the one up here some place i'm not really sure um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		over in Fort Worth they had one catch fire here a couple of years ago and they had an awful time putting it out
 		but our big problem down here course is uh tires laying around down on the ground and stuff uh collect water and then of course that becomes mosquito breeding area and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh that's right too yeah i didn't think of yeah
 	
 	
 		that can be a real
 	
 	
 		yeah Connecticut was uh is in the process of building  a a plant to burn tires to generate electricity
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		so i guess that's kind of of a a recycling process
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the uh  all the all the communities in Rhode Island eventually are going to go on this like the recycling that we have now it depends on on each individual municipality
 		uh we went on it quite early because of the town fathers said yeah you know we think it's a good idea
 		but the state i think by nineteen ninety three every every town in the state has to go on this recycling program so it's like a forced
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um which is good i think
 	
 	
 		yeah what happens to us anyways as you can imagine in Texas you've got urban areas that are probably as compact or as you know densely populated as just about any place in the country but then
 	
 	
 		yeah well you guys got
 	
 	
 		then you run into uh areas you know they've
 		we've got a statistic down here that they like to use you know you can take the population of the world and pack it in the state of Texas about the density of Houston and then you'd have the rest of the world to grow crops in because there wouldn't be any people in it
 	
 	
 		yeah Houston's probably as big as this whole state of Rhode Island
 	
 	
 		uh yeah uh the panhandle the the there's well there's several counties in west Texas
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and New Mexico too for that matter that are bigger than Rhode Island but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we had a our  our government rep i'm in DSEG here
