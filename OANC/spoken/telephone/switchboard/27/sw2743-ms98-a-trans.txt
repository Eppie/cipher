 		hi
 		well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants shrubbery that were guaranteed and we had no problem with it we got our money got our money back
 	
 	
 		well why
 		very good
 		good well what do you think that uh consumer goods goods are generally getting better or worse in quality
 	
 	
 		well
 		i believe they're better
 	
 	
 		i do too
 		i believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time
 		but i don't i i believe that they're better now than they were
 	
 	
 		i think so i don't think that shoddy not as shoddy electrical appliances i think are pretty good reliable reliable
 	
 	
 		however i didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty three thousand miles on it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i don't like it very well if when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at uh on one side
 	
 	
 		oh did you return it
 	
 	
 		no i had moved away
 	
 	
 		no
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i had taken the first one back i didn't think that it heated well enough it never did get  anything but just moderately warm
 		took it back and  um the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be and i fell for it and uh when i got this one
 		it did a little it heated a little bit warmer and then after one year it started heating only on one side
 	
 	
 		huh so either you or your husband can be warm but not both
 	
 	
 		also i took an iron back after having it only one year
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		now i figure that uh anybody that is dumb enough to iron
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		needs to have an iron that will last a long time and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh did they replace it
 	
 	
 		well without even any question but i think it was the store
 	
 	
 		uh-huh Wal-Mart i was going to say it must have been Wal-Mart
 	
 	
 		Wal-Mart
 		yes  and uh well well have you been buying any clothes lately any new clothes
 	
 	
 		i haven't bought any new clothes well
 		the last thing i bought was a dress last summer
 		and  the buttons turned on it over over the winter the buttons tarnished slightly and i have not gone back about it
 	
 	
 		that was poor quality i think
 	
 	
 		i think it is too and it was an expensive dress
 	
 	
 		i wondered if it weren't expensive and they should have put buttons on it that  would last forever
 	
 	
 		yes it was
 		that's right that's what i think too and one belt loop the one um  you know like the chain link chain belt loop
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		half of it raveled out
 		and that was i believe a Leslie Faye dress and it was
 	
 	
 		the
 	
 	
 		i think over a hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		do you spend that much on your dresses
 	
 	
 		yep i don't usually but i did that one
 	
 	
 		you're really divulging very personal information
 	
 	
 		but i think it should've been better than that for that money is what i mean
 	
 	
 		oh of course i do too
 		well i believe that we've been talking about five minutes and Norma it is just wonderful to talk to you
 	
 	
 		okay i think so
 		good talking to you too i've enjoyed it  ah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you are a good one to talk about consumer goods because you keep up on it all the time
 	
 	
 		well we'll be talking to you later bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
