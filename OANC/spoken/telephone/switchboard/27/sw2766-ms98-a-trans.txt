 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we're supposed to talk about the Middle East crisis and should we be involved and uh what's it going to cost us in the long run
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay
 	
 	
 		are you ready
 	
 	
 		i guess so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the Middle East crisis should we be there
 	
 	
 		oh dear that's a hard one that's really hard for me because
 		uh you know i really i have a son that's sixteen and i think you know eventually you know he'll be of of drafting age and i think gosh do i want him to go and yet i'm proud to be an American and i know that we have a
 		a country that you know people would give anything to live in a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have and yet i don't know whether i'd be willing to give his life for for this country and yet
 		and yet i know that i that and i i when i was in school it was always the tired the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism
 		but i'm not sure that that that's the reason anymore
 		i mean not sure that communism is is as strong as it once was and i'm not sure that that that's the reason why we're like we were in Vietnam supposedly so
 	
 	
 		well you realize why we were
 		in the Middle East why we invaded Iraq why we were in Saudi why we attacked Kuwait and we we're why we are still fighting Iraq
 	
 	
 		well with the
 		well it's because of oil isn't it
 	
 	
 		no i really believe it's because
 		i think it has something to do with oil don't get me wrong
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but Saddam is Saddam is a madman
 	
 	
 		oh yes i agree with that
 	
 	
 		anyone that would
 		use chemical weapons to fight his own people
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well yeah he's uh a bad person very definitely
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		obviously that has something to do with it
 	
 	
 		oh sure sure
 	
 	
 		and
 		and if you know i can see that
 		he was in Kuwait
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Kuwait was the non aggressor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		the Saudis are our allies
 		we have several treaties and several alliances
 		with the Saudis that range back for probably forty years
 	
 	
 		yeah many years
 	
 	
 		you know they've been our friends through thick and thin
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they were at the Saudi border
 	
 	
 		well
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and ready to storm into Saudi
 		shouldn't we try and help our friends
 	
 	
 		certainly but what at at what cost you know that's the uh the thing it came out it came out wonderfully supposedly i mean everything is and we won
 	
 	
 		what did we lose forty one Americans lives
 	
 	
 		yeah and that that's wonderful but what if if that wasn't the case what if we would have lost thousands of young men would that would it have been too much of a price to pay for that i don't know see and i think there are a lot of things that we don't know but
 	
 	
 		oh of course our government is full of liars thieves and crooks
 	
 	
 		the American people
 		oh sure well and there's a lot that we
 	
 	
 		and that's our own fault because we elected them
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's true but i think there's a lot that we the public doesn't need to know i think there's some things we shouldn't know just for national national security sake
 		and i you know i think if we did know i think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because i don't i don't think people could handle it so i think there are things that we should not know the masses shouldn't know but i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too
 	
 	
 		you know
 		it's uh
 		i went on jury duty here not long back
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		one of the
 		guys that was on the jury they were asking him if if you could believe a lawyer or if a lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and one guy being selected
 		snickered and couldn't keep his head up you know and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the guy said well can you share it with us what you what you find so funny he says well i already told you my sons a lawyer
 		he said that when he graduated the day after his bar examine there in Houston
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he told him
 		dad you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you his lips are moving
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh  oh
 	
 	
 		and ninety percent of all politicians are lawyers
 	
 	
 		oh i have a lawyer background yeah have a law background you're right
 	
 	
 		so by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars
 		the fact that they take our money
 		and don't do what we think is right makes them thieves
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true  yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		so what's it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi
 		are we going to lose more lives there
 	
 	
 		see and i don't know i don't know i can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it i mean i thought the war was going to go on and on i really was surprised when it ended so quickly and
 	
 	
 		well we hit them
 		with more
 		in one month
 		than we used in three years the last three years of Vietnam
 	
 	
 		i know yeah
 	
 	
 		and whenever
 		you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		there's
 		nothing they can do about it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know it's not like we
 		threw
 		eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		we were there the Brits were there the French were there this is with UN backing
 	
 	
 		um right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and to some level even Russia was behind us
 	
 	
 		um-hum right they were
 	
 	
 		so
 		honestly if
 		there is was
 		a well perceived war world wide this was it
 	
 	
 		oh sure sure
 	
 	
 		but
 		what i can't understand is
 		then many of the Kuwaiti youth
 		didn't fight wouldn't fight
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's okay for us to go expend our
 		youth's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		lives like so much water in the desert
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's not their job to fight for their own land
 	
 	
 		yeah that is very  it's very strange uh and yet you know see that's another thing that that's difficult for Americans their culture is so much different than ours that
 		you know i've heard from many people that we could not even begin begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours
 		and um they just don't think the same way we do their culture is completely different and almost opposite
 	
 	
 		and really from all i can indicate from all indications the Iraqi
 		beliefs if you will
 		are more similar to our own
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and
 		the Kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country
 		the Kuwaiti
 		young
 		won't rebuild anything they won't work
 	
 	
 		huh i didn't realize that
 	
 	
 		yeah it was on the news last night
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		US Army is doing it all
 	
 	
 		hum yeah  see and that's another question you have to ask is this our job is are we should we still be there even you know
 		i don't know the answers to that those questions i think they're tough and i think you know it's i don't know that anybody knows the answers i think they know what they believe but i'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure
 	
 	
 		well they talked to uh one Kuwaiti woman yesterday
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and her biggest concern in life was
 		that she couldn't get a housekeeper
 	
 	
 		you're kidding that's unreal
 	
 	
 		and do you have a housekeeper
 	
 	
 		no
 		no and don't plan on having one either ever so
 	
 	
 		well i wouldn't mind having one
 	
 	
 		oh i'd love to have one but you know
 	
 	
 		but you know i'd like to uh make sure that i have a job tomorrow first
 	
 	
 		sure sure that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it it astound you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man woman and child money
 	
 	
 		uh no i wasn't i didn't wasn't aware of that no
 	
 	
 		for nothing
 	
 	
 		for doing nothing yeah
 	
 	
 		for nothing for for for doing nothing for sitting on there keisters
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		ooh that ought to give their programming trouble shouldn't it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 		they do nothing they hand them money each year and they're part of
