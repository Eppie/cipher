 
     		
 	
 		hi this is Judy i'm from Maryland and i'm in California visiting right now
 	
 	
 		hi Judy this is Norma and i live in Virginia
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		we got a great topic
 	
 	
 		i know i'm sitting here going oh dear  should we give it a try
 	
 	
 		i guess we might as well
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well um so so so what changes have you seen
 	
 	
 		let you start
 		
 
 		what changes uh i guess the biggest i don't know your age Judy but i in my lifetime the biggest is in
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		more women working definitely
 	
 	
 		well actually that's what i was thinking too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um you know just to jump ahead a little bit but then we can back up is it perhaps women in politics is for the future
 	
 	
 		for the future right yeah
 	
 	
 		because i don't see that really yet
 		in positions of power really
 	
 	
 		right i don't see them in positions in power in corporations either  not many
 	
 	
 		ah
 		that's true that's true
 		um do you work in private corporation or government
 	
 	
 		i did work in government
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		and before that i worked in a bank for eight years
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and now i'm retired
 	
 	
 		oh are you  that's the best status  yes um i don't i see um in
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		which do you work in excuse me
 	
 	
 		a government
 	
 	
 		in government
 	
 	
 		and i work in academia before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um actually there's one um woman in our i don't know what you'd call it uh institute who is a manager and i mean in a sense
 		perhaps um
 		a lot of she gets protected a lot because uh it's almost like a token
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and and it's sort of unfortunate
 		because i think that they don't accept her technically and but she's a good paper pusher
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's in a technical position really
 		and you know she should be more technical for what she does
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think that's sort of unfortunate because it doesn't it doesn't really help the cause in the long run
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um but um
 		you know i don't know and and teaching i still see that that's where most of the women are
 	
 	
 		in teaching
 	
 	
 		in teaching and you know and it's always been that way
 	
 	
 		but not at the college level
 	
 	
 		right not well
 	
 	
 		we live in a college town and i worked at the university for a while and there are there are woman there but they're not the high paid
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum not department chairmen
 	
 	
 		professors that the men are
 	
 	
 		yeah not the deans and things like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they did have one woman dean but and i guess she she probably did very well but
 		that's the minority
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		hum
 		and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or or just don't or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs
 	
 	
 		none of the above  i think they are extremely well qualified
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know how
 	
 	
 		they're just not selected somehow
 	
 	
 		i think they're not selected
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and course
 		at this university uh this it's a big engineering school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i don't think there are many women in the engineering college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's where the high pay is
 	
 	
 		oh okay but i'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering actually but you know i say that but yet i know two
 	
 	
 		quite an well i think there are more than there used to be
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm sure there are
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they may not go into teaching
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i mean the two that i know obviously are not in teaching but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's it  i suppose in a since i was surprised when they told me they majored majored in engineering i don't know why i but i don't know that many men that have majored in engineering either
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean it's just because i'm in the humanities it's just
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know it's not not something that i tend to hear about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um
 		yeah it's uh
 	
 	
 		well i met one one day that uh had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering and that really surprised me
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i mean i i suppose that that it's difficult to really say why because
 		you know there there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and maybe there aren't you know
 		maybe they don't apply for the job
 	
 	
 		i don't know i don't i don't know how many go on and get a PhD in engineering
 	
 	
 		right right which could be you know partial partially cultural anyway
 	
 	
 		that could be that's true
 	
 	
 		so that it might be circularly being the same problem of of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway so why spend your time getting qualified
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a rough
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's a rough a rough situation
 		um
 		and i guess what i what amazes amazes me is
 		the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids or and in our case we actually have one father who works part-time a six hour day so that he can take the kids
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		kids or kid i'm not sure to school in the morning and be home
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 	
 	
 		when the children or child comes home in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		
 
 		is it uh was she the major wage earner i mean did she earn more money that he did or do you know
 	
 	
 		th is is uh
 		well see i don't know anything about the family but but yeah i would imagine she might
 		um because he's
 		you you know he's a really nice guy but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that maybe he you know maybe she was more qualified but still but still it's interesting that you know he he's been doing this evidently for a a good number of years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and but it's unusual
 	
 	
 		i i know one uh gal that's she's a CPA
 		and her husband is a house husband
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		and then they had a child and he he still was the house husband he's the one that was going to
 	
 	
 		oh he was even before they had children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh even before that right
 	
 	
 		oh now that that really is
 	
 	
 		she was a little perturbed about it at one time i don't know how she's moved away i don't know how it is now but i know uh
 	
 	
 		oh she was
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we're we all went out one evening and
 		after work and uh
 		she was
 		there was an underlying note that she was perturbed about it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i mean i think that would be it would it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		somebody to stay home that
 	
 	
 		i don't think there was a valid reason  because her statement was
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		i told him let's face it you're a house husband that's what your going that's what you'll always be
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but but yet you know we have to think about that because if if she had opted to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything strange
 	
 	
 		she wouldn't have been that's right uh-huh that's right it would
 	
 	
 		so so we're carrying our own prejudice
 	
 	
 		it wouldn't have been a downer
 		uh-huh that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah oh gee  i guess we can't win
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh-uh
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because yeah if if somebody does it and breaks tradition you're surprised but
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		oh dear so so
 	
 	
 		i think maybe more men would like to be if they  weren't put down so badly
 	
 	
 		if they could get away with it
 		oh dear you know well i mean it it's an interesting topic yet i must say it's not one that i've given a great deal of of thought to but um
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		
 
 		no i don't
 	
 	
 		in the past it's um
 		one of those things that you know seems to happen
 	
 	
 		how do you feel your career has gone
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't feel for the most part that i've been discriminated against
 	
 	
 		you don't that's good
 	
 	
 		no i was a department chairman i don't but i don't like administration
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so then i'm uh uh probably a poor example although you know i was an administrator and could still be i suppose
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh i was discriminated against very definitely in banking
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was terrible
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you were you were more ambitious than they would let you be
 	
 	
 		right and the money didn't go with the positions
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i would
 	
 	
 		the promotion promotions came but there were there wasn't comparable pay for the responsibility
 		and i was told you don't need as much pay as i have because your children are older than my children or your husband has a good job and
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah actually in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government um at i was taken advantage of
 		and and that's true that you know sometimes other people get get higher increments
 	
 	
 		i think
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for you know even
 	
 	
 		i think we are programmed to just take it as it comes
 	
 	
 		right
 		right that's probably true i hadn't i hadn't thought about it because i do like what i do and i just sort of ignore the administrative part of it since i didn't like it when when i had to do it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i i figure you know nobody must uh nobody must like it it must be a rotten job for everybody  but i know some people thrive on it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 		well
 		since i don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic
 	
 	
 		i don't
