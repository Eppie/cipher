 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		i'll let you go first
 	
 	
 		well i think i don't know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax
 		so if you're renting a house or doing anything else you're not
 		actually contributing to the education of your children
 		and i think that's wrong i think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent
 		then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system
 		so
 		as it turns out we don't really have a
 		tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh i spent a couple uh years down in uh Plano Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death for the uh Plano uh school system
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh  i've you know i know that Texas doesn't have a state tax and so all the things come out of the the property taxes
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		and i was uh really shocked at the amount of taxes i ended up paying i was i was better off paying a state tax  back in Maryland where  than i was uh paying the uh property tax down there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you would be
 	
 	
 		uh what they did in Maryland to get around that is they uh they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services  that the renters were getting including the uh educational services
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the tax was administered by um
 		the uh rental company that actually was managing the apartments so when uh long long time ago when i used to live in apartments i would pay a rent
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		payment every month and a tax payment every month
 	
 	
 		gee
 	
 	
 		and the tax payment went to pay for the services that i was
 		getting as a a resident of that particular county
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		and uh that's the way it worked here in Maryland we have uh
 		a certain portion of your your property taxes uh goes to education but also a portion of the state tax that you pay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		goes back into the county that you live in
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		to pay for the educational system
 	
 	
 		oh well that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		and so it it works out nice it it it makes it so that the
 		uh whole county now i i know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland uh like Collin County uh would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County here in Maryland
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean the the counties are much larger
 		you know in the the whole state of Maryland i believe there's only like uh fifteen counties
 	
 	
 		gee whiz
 	
 	
 		and so uh you know each county has their own school system an and it works out real nice um
 		the the the flip side to this is are we getting what we're paying for and i don't believe so um a lot of things have come to head um recently and i heard a report because of uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh the emphasis that the President was putting on education
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know um him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education in other words they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then at the end of uh school year they would be tested and then they go into the fourth grade and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing so when they came up with these this nationwide system of public schools
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they gave some figures out and since it's inception uh they've the price has gone up per student the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty three percent
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so they're actually spending thirty three percent and that's real dollars you know that adjusting it back to to the days you know when it started uh probably you know seventy years ago
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty three percent improvement in education
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		we've actually gone backwards
 	
 	
 		well they say that Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation that our high school graduates can't even match the national average
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you know our school system down here is
 		no where near perfect but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah well they they've been having some problems uh even here in uh like Baltimore City which is a a pretty good city good good sized city
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they've been putting a lot of uh stress on it and of course speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to you know do everything they're supposed to do and of course they've uh been cutting the teachers salaries because they say we don't have the money to do it and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yep
 	
 	
 		all the services are costing more money and and everything uh but the uh a lot of emphasis now is being put on you know when children used to be taught
 		you know like uh uh each child is individual you know they're not all the same
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they need to take things at their own speed
 	
 	
 		and
 		some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade and then all of a sudden everything clicks in you know and then there are some students that you know read well at five years old
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know seem to excel and so that the you know one of the things i heard proposed on uh one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed
 		some kids
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it'd be a lot better
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know each child has to learn at his own rate they can't keep force feeding things to each other and
 		or you know at the kids
 	
 	
 		and and uh
 		and on top of that they they make the child feel inferior
 	
 	
 		um-hum because he can't do it
 	
 	
 		because he's not as good as another kid his same age i mean it's like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that's ridiculous
 	
 	
 		and it's not that he can't do it he just can't do it quite as fast or
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh you know i have uh i i have five children total and i've got two out of the house already and i have i have two that are in uh eighth grade this year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		all right
 	
 	
 		and prior to their um
 		when i when they were in elementary school they were identified identified as being slow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so they put them into special programs and then we actually held them back in fourth grade
 		and
 		it wasn't until the last two years um last year my uh they're they're a set of twins um a boy and a girl last year the the uh boy twin started doing real well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		all right
 	
 	
 		and it it it everything started to click in for him and he knew what he n eeded to do um and this year it it happened for uh for the daughter
 	
 	
 		huh all right
 	
 	
 		she just has been
 	
 	
 		jumped on out there
 	
 	
 		really doing grea t this year and she has the right attitude towards school and everything and i think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path i remember when i was in school i did horrible
 	
 	
 		that's good
 		yeah i did too up until ninth or tenth grade
 	
 	
 		up until about
 		yeah about the seventh eighth grade i i i started to to come around and realize an and basically i got interested in math and uh never really did well in English but you know once you got interested in something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and things started to click in place
 		then after that you take off
 	
 	
 		yeah and see when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course i had a electronics course i could take but we lived out in the country and we didn't have all that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		fancy stuff to worry about you know we had our auto shop out there and our agricultural shop and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know we had just about every thing that we needed but they don't have it anymore
 		there's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore
 		our our oldest boy goes to Lubbock High down here and they go to school four and half days a week
 		so
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		that's pretty weird
 	
 	
 		yeah it is um my children had a uh real culture shock um when we lived in Plano i guess i don't know if you've heard about the Plano school district but they're uh they really stress academics there
 	
 	
 		no
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and uh God if your child is not an honor student well then  you're something wrong with you as a parent and that that's kind of the way they are there
 	
 	
 		gee
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh when we moved back to Maryland um i moved to a uh a
 		Baltimore County which is a northern county in Maryland
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we lived you know in the northern part of the county uh we went from a uh
 		middle school in Texas that served fifty five square blocks to a uh middle school in Maryland that served fifty five square miles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was just a complete culture shock because i mean they they're riding on the bus in the morning with uh other kids that you know are a sleep because they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores and you know it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i can imagine
 		yeah
 		yeah that would be quite a shock
 	
 	
 		and they had uh agricultural they had an agricultural course uh i forget what it was called uh but it goes along the the lines of industrial arts but it's  agricultural and where they had to raise a small animal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh like Four H then
 	
 	
 		had to learn how to drive a tractor
 		they actually had to go take a driving test on the tractor i mean they just couldn't believe this and it was great they loved it
 	
 	
 		all right
 		all right
 	
 	
 		i mean they really enjoyed the courses
 		um
 		and it you know it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain a drain
 	
 	
 		yeah just something you do everyday
 	
 	
 		yeah and it was you know it was like  kind of like the way we feel about going to work
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah just something i have to do everyday
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh up here they seem to have made it uh a lot of fun for them and they they seem to really enjoy it
 	
 	
 		that's good our oldest boy went into
 		school politics and made vice
