 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		alrighty i think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that they've changed from homemaker to the work market  and for several reasons probably some of that is divorce
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and some is they're more educated than they used to be i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i think sometimes uh leaders in government they've become more uh adroit in that area too instead of just men all the time have more women in government
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and now i'll let you say something
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well uh i probably a little bit older than you are so what i see um is the change that i see the most is the is that um
 		women have much more many more occupations and careers to choose from than when i went went to college when i went to college you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary or
 		but there were very few women in business at that time a few but they were the oddity and
 	
 	
 		very limited
 	
 	
 		yes and now i see and and i see for my daughter which is wonderful  she's thirteen and i see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from so many different jobs which i think is terrific because
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i'm a teacher and i mean i love teaching but though i think there are a lot of other things i would have liked better and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		not that i would give the career up because it's it's a safe career plus because i always have a job plus i am a single parent too and i and i need the income
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh and i think that's a reason why a lot of women have have started to work too is because economically it's just a must
 	
 	
 		i think that's right
 	
 	
 		uh you just it's very difficult to get along on one income unless uh the male uh has an extraordinarily good job
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and especially men who teach school they don't make that much money and and most all they always either have they're either moonlighting or else their their wife works too
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um it's just an economic need now
 	
 	
 		i really think women have so much more responsibility than you know as far as everything
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 	
 	
 		and like you said um one women today have so many uh the average today of having a a single family you know with the mother as the head is just really um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so commonplace nowadays
 	
 	
 		oh yes exactly we have uh quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the majority is uh married couple with children but still there's a lot more than there used to be and see you never picture yourself in a situation like this when i married i thought i'd be married the rest of my life
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and uh but i'm all i'm really grateful that i went to college my mother always said you know get an education in case you need one because my father died when we were i have a twin sister and we were eleven when he died
 		she had a nursing degree and she was able to make it but she said in just you never know what's going to happen and i thank God that i did go to college and got a degree because otherwise i don't know how i would be able to raise my children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you know isn't that funny uh because the same thing happened to us except i was twelve and my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession and was isn't that funny
 	
 	
 		isn't that something
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh but just that they were able to do it you know and even today i think the chance for education is is so much uh better for all of our girls and and boys too but but the girls especially
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh yes
 		yeah i do too but i think it needs to continue to change and i mean i think it there's still not equality as far as uh paychecks for men and women i think that the we still have a long way to go
 	
 	
 		a lot of things yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i think that uh uh i think by the year two thousand it we're going to see  some a lot more changes uh hopefully that women are you know able to get the the executive jobs and hold positions that men
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		men do because they can do it just as well you know if they want to dedicate their uh most of their time to that they're they're they can do it
 	
 	
 		yeah and i also think that in the future that uh it's gonna continue that we're not gonna see a lax off of women in the work force i think they're going to stay there and i think that they're gonna
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		uh be really responsible and and do everything just like what you said you know make make it the grade and and make it so women can be the top people in their in their field
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly and i think that's the way it should be i think it i mean not that i i think that i'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that i
 	
 	
 		oh i think so
 	
 	
 		could never do strengthwise and so forth but also there's some things women can do like have children that men can't do
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you know it it i don't want i don't want to be equal but i i want to be i want  to get what i deserve and i want to be able to be on the same level with them if i can do a job as well as i man i think i should get the same pay you know
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah and i just i'm not a women's libber i really am not but i i think that well that we have
 		just as many rights as they do and i feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then she they should get the job with the same pay
 	
 	
 		that's right and i think that is happening more and more i think it's just gonna take a little bit longer
 	
 	
 		i do too
 		oh i do too definitely definitely
 	
 	
 		well great okay
 	
 	
 		well it was good to talk to you
 	
 	
 		good to talk to you Sally thanks bye-bye
 	
 	
 		all right bye-bye
