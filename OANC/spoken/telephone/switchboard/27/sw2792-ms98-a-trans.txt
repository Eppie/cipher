 		yeah
 	
 	
 		mostly uh something i like like true life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		not uh you know documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i also like romantic novels
 		i like uh
 		i like Readers' Digest  believe it or not i usually read that from cover to cover
 	
 	
 		yeah so do i
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like it because there's a little bit of everything in it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know that kind of a thing uh as far as like real novels
 		i haven't gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i wish i had in some in some senses but i don't have time really as much as i would like to to get into that kind of thing
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i like like you said real life um i like uh biographies of people's lives like especially like athletes for some reason it seems to interest me like people that make a big comeback or
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you know Orel Hershiser things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i like to read books on improve like family marriage
 		you know things that are written by like Christian authors or um
 		doctors about family and you know how to improve your home and all that kind of thing um i like to read the magazines i to read like i like to read Readers' Digest i read a lot of bicycling magazines
 		they're i mainly look at the pictures and stuff but they just usually have some good articles in them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know i haven't really found any romance type stuff i like to read i i'm more true you know fiction uh nonfiction i haven't found a lot of uh fiction books that i really like
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh not to say i wouldn't eventually i mean what was the last book you read
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh jeez let me think it i tell you i haven't read a book in a long time
 		and it i can't even really remember uh i think it was a romantic novel by Danielle Steel or one of those you know yeah  honestly um i don't do as much reading like i say as i would like to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've been working a lot of hours at work and
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and then of course we have a home so it's
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		you know a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or you know that type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i set i set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is
 		like about eleven more books than i would have read last year but so far i've only read like two books and so i'm not doing very well but
 	
 	
 		but see i do crafts too so it's hard i if i have a minute that's what i do i do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i find it's real hard i let papers newspapers stack up and magazines stack up if i don't really set aside a time to look or or read them
 	
 	
 		and
 		that's the and and that's like myself i've i've i've miss it because i really find it a very relaxing hobby too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i really do and um
 		i don't know it seems like you can get lost in a book you know it it it's like an escape for me i don't know about you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's if i'm really interested in what i'm reading i mean hours can go by and i i look up at the clock and say oh my word you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in fact i'd rather read sometimes than watch TV
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i would too
 		um
 	
 	
 		but i think you get out of the habit like you say you have to like kind of set yourself
 	
 	
 		kind of train your mind
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		have you ever read uh or heard of the book This Present Darkness
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		that was one of the books i read this year and it's really fast paced and intense
 		it was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book but it was a real it was one of the best i've read i mean it was it was real good and it was um
 		it was one of the few books that like it you know just hurry up and go through without putting down you know
 	
 	
 		yeah right  see that's the other problem i have if i start into something and i really enjoy what i'm reading
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then i have a terrible time getting away from it too i'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning
 		you know because i'm so engrossed in it and then before you know it it's time to get up and go to work you know that type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's why i i don't know i'm i'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that even if i'm uh doing something like an afghan if i'm close to the end sometimes i'll do the same thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know what you would call it maybe i have a problem
 	
 	
 		no i'm sure it's
 	
 	
 		it's terrible i i really like books that that you can get into and that's sense
 	
 	
 		fast  or something
 		uh-huh
 		i know what you mean
 		i like reading late at night right before i go to bed sometimes i just sleep better or something
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you do you kind of get relaxed that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i have a lot of craft books that i have too and uh magazines i like People you know those things that are about real people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i i like to uh read about people who've been a successful you know who've who made a success of their lives
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		which what book have you read that is along those lines
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that was really good
 	
 	
 		to to to give you specific titles i can't i can't like i say haven't done it in
 	
 	
 		well how about who
 	
 	
 		in such a long time
 	
 	
 		do you know who it was about
 	
 	
 		um well i went to uh seminar on uh
 		it was for by American business and some of the people uh what the heck was his name i'm trying to think he's one of the uh Paroe and um
 		it was more like oh it there was tapes and things that they had about him too
 		how he started out as just a salesman and now he's you know multimillionaire and that type of thing and uh how you have to uh be aggressive and you know really want something for yourself and that type of stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's like up to you in other words whatever happens in your life it's not up it's not someone else you have to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i find t hat fascinating that people you know can do that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just make up their minds that that's it you know have this one direction
 	
 	
 		and then do it
 	
 	
 		do it i can't i'm not that focused on something i i'm off in all directions um and i'm not uh um a planner which i wish i was
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know kind of off the wall if someone says do you want to do this tonight uh and i got a mountain of things to do it's okay you know we do it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  well that's all right
 	
 	
 		i know i know but i wish i was more the other way
 	
 	
 		you're more fun though see  you're not ridged right
 	
 	
 		yeah right i i that's see i like it that way though i i i would i don't want to change that part of me
 		that's funny uh even though i admire someone who isn't
 	
 	
 		that's good
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like i am you know and and i wish i could be more that way but
 	
 	
 		there may be some schools you could read about and learn
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true how many people do you supervise
 	
 	
 		uh about twenty
 	
 	
 		oh that's not bad
 		that's not bad at all
 	
 	
 		no
 		no
 	
 	
 		do you like your job
 	
 	
 		sometimes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		sometimes more than others but yeah i do i've been there about three years
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 		oh that's important do you have a family
 	
 	
 		yeah i just got married last year and
 		um most of my family's in Indiana
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i've only been in Texas three years
 	
 	
 		do you like it
 	
 	
 		yeah i do i love the weather down here
 	
 	
 		i i loved i loved Abilene too that's what i liked too is the weather
 	
 	
 		yeah i know
 	
 	
 		except for tornados
 	
 	
 		boy they they have storms here i've
 	
 	
 		yes they do and it it it's so surprising how it just happens you know
 	
 	
 		hail and thunder and
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		unpredictable
 	
 	
 		were you here during the hailstorm two years ago
 	
 	
 		uh no oh i've been up here about three uh we were down there uh from eighty six to
 		eighty five to eighty six no uh eighty well part of eighty four to eighty six i should say
 	
 	
 		yeah boy
 		i had thirty three hundred dollars damage done on my car a lot of people had their cars totaled
 		just from hail
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		i think State Farm went bankrupt just about
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 		i know the whole situation is bad
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		up here we're having a terrible time with the recession
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's not good at all
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i know things are pretty booming down there
 		i heard they sold Johnson City though
 	
 	
 		yeah and Colorado Springs
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and Colorado Springs
 	
 	
 		yeah i talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day and he was telling me about it
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		they just sold it
 	
 	
 		amazing
 	
 	
 		closed up and moved down to McKinney
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good at least they kept the business part of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's scary though i'm telling you
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		i don't know and well you know with the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family
 	
 	
 		how do i feel what
 	
 	
 		that that books influence do you know how to use them in your life or to influence
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i feel like it's important for young children to read too and what you read to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when my children were were younger of course they were all married and grown and i have grandchildren now they were uh i i read to them a lot
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		and uh i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also i'm not saying they read all the right things but they do read uh where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all and i think it's important
 	
 	
 		that's real yeah
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens i mean they don't learn anything it's because they can't read
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really surprising how many people graduate from high school and that i work with and people i mean i get memos all the time across my desk and things are misspelled and it's really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh it's so unbelievable isn't it
 	
 	
 		it's pretty sad a lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly and i think that that's why reading is so important
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh i think even mentally when you can do some
