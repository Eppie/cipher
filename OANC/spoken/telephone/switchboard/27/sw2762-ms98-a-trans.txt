 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		um you know one thing that i miss being in a small company is the opportunity for um
 		job growth just different job opportunity i was talking with somebody from Bausch and Lomb today and she was telling me how she started as a clerk typist and then found another opening in another department and
 		moved on and so forth and so forth and is now uh personnel uh director
 		and i mean it's just it's there's so much opportunity in a larger company to uh stay within the same company so you're not losing your seniority level but um
 		just to try new things and and see new areas and departments and i mean you can in in a large company you can go from one department to another department as if if you switched companies sometimes
 	
 	
 		well yes you have an opportunity to  to use a J O B system which is a job opportunity system it's most companies most big companies have that but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i think sometime that you get lost in that also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i really do i i i sometimes think that
 		a small company may offer
 		well i'm not sure how to put
 	
 	
 		well uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure how to put this but that's not
 		uh perhaps better one on one uh relations a a big company sometime you can get lost you can you can uh opportunities do arise
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the competition is much greater for that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh well it's true yeah
 	
 	
 		opportunity okay
 	
 	
 		there is a very uh uh at least in my office and i know that's not necessarily the way it is all over but the camaraderie within the office
 		when you're with a small company i think you're right you could be even uh you can be a big person in a small company you know
 	
 	
 		exactly i and i think you get a lot more support from your coworkers and and often times in a big company you are asked to go and do things in other areas that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		may not be your expertise okay but they require you to do this as their as your uh stepping stone or whatever you'd care to call it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and that can get to be sometimes very very disastrous with the consequences of that because people do the best they can
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure
 	
 	
 		and often times it's not really what
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		was aimed at in the first place if that makes sense
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i yeah i understand that you know a question that i have for you is um do you feel working working in a large company do you feel that you can see the impact that you make
 		do you feel that you can see like the results i know in my company each person is vital because we are the company and each person really can see the results that they produce
 	
 	
 		yes i can i see that in my job because my particular job is of of a troubleshooting nature and i'm you know it's one of these put out fires things  so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i can see the results of that
 	
 	
 		i see yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 		yes i i'm i i get a lot of gratification from my job but some some folks i guess they go to work every day and they just go to work for a paycheck every every two weeks or every month or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i
 	
 	
 		but in my particular job i really enjoy it because i do have an opportunity to help other people do better okay and i really like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh i i do feel bad for the people i mean obviously we all work for a paycheck but it's nice if you can be enjoying it you know while you're doing it
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah i i i also teach school at at TI at uh Texas Instruments i'm a i'm an instructor there so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i teach new
 		well not new employees but all yeah all employee any employees really that that care to and we talked about the job opportunity system we have uh a system where we train people to to become what we call automation specialists
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and it's a job where if you as a secretary you decide you want to be uh an automation specialist which is a much higher paying job and a much more technical job
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then you would come to one of our in-house classes
 	
 	
 		that is great
 	
 	
 		on on company time
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and and and or on overtime so we don't involve the the uh production process okay of of personnel coming to our classes and we set up and establish these
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		sixteen and twenty week classes at at uh three hours a day twice a week
 		for automation specialist training
 	
 	
 		that is wonderful
 	
 	
 		when you finish hopefully you've acquired enough knowledge to uh
 		you know move on into advanced machinery type operations and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and that that's really gratifying to me i
 		i see a lot of young folks come in and and gals and guys both and some gals that say i've no i don't know a hammer from a
 		a nail or a wrench i mean you know and okay that's and that's where we'll start but and we have the other side of the coin where you have you know really advanced people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh well
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		coming in and and top notch uh
 		mechanical type people and they want to do better so they of come they they jump right on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		that is great and that is so smart because with uh everything becoming so much more technical and sophisticated
 		you're just not finding people out in the work force that have the skills that you necessarily need
 	
 	
 		no that's a fact and
 	
 	
 		i mean you just don't find them and it it's such such a great way take the people that you already have and train them
 	
 	
 		and train and train them we sometimes we have to uh simply for for two reasons one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that we we are changing jobs constantly where we are changing our methods of doing things and we are finding more economical methods and more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay and the other thing is we cannot find the people outside to just walk in off the street and help us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		so
 		but that would be the same in your type of secretarial job i'm that one time we the girls used to have just the typewriter and they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh exactly
 	
 	
 		and then they had word processors and now they've got full blown desk top publishers so you know
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		oh exactly i mean it's incredible
 	
 	
 		it is i i'm that amazes me that you know people say your job amazes me well my job is really nothing i sit there and i watch some little gal make me all kinds of charts and view foils and graphs and
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's i it's you know they use laser printers and all that and it's absolutely mind boggling uh because i could probably turn it on before i get the screen to go completely blank you know and i generally do that
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah
 		
 
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i i was in the same situation i had to learn
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i i had no knowledge of a computer at all i'm a master
 		mechanic but not a computer expert
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but now i'm in to Lotus and word processing and i can hold my own with that
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		that is fabulous
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		you know another benefit that that i wish i had more of and who wouldn't is vacation time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know um
 		i think that uh when when you're working and an especially i don't know i mean every job you you say how you're constantly putting out fires
 		you know i i feel like my job is like that too unfortunately but that just it drains you you know after a while it just
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i feel that way and it's a long time to get you know you work for many years with two weeks vacation per year
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah exactly right
 	
 	
 		and then if you have extra days out for
 		what other reasons uh there may be uh an and we we try to deal on an individual basis with them but you can be penalized for that an and it it's penalized against your merit increases and et cetera
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so i mean you are allowed a certain number of days of what we call sick time and personal time off but if you you know if you extend beyond those
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		an and at times we will adjust on a one to one basis
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for some unusual circumstances but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to work for a company almost fifteen years with two weeks vacation it seems to me like an awful long time
 	
 	
 		it's hard
 		is that uh what your company policy is too
 	
 	
 		well no it well in some instances yes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay in some instances it would be we start with a a weeks vacation and then it's two weeks after a year or so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but then that two weeks stays and then it goes to three weeks for a long long time and then after fifteen years it's four weeks
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		but that's still that's a long time you know
 	
 	
 		but that is a long time and especially when you take a weeks vacation
 		i was just talking to somebody about this today it's funny it takes you until Tuesday or Wednesday to really wind down
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		you know to say okay i i can relax i can sit here for an hour if i want to and just not do anything and realize that you don't have to be worrying about something you know
 	
 	
 		i think uh i would like to see
 		i would like to see more
 		well
 		it's like the kids were talking in California about going to school all year but they have breaks every ninety days or thirty days or ninety days or whatever it is they have two weeks off or a week off or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they find that that's much
 		better for them than having the whole summer off an where they're completely bored like the second month into i think i think industry really would really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		benefit from that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure how we would accommodate all of our people being on vacation at all various times but we would always be shorthanded i guess but so that's a problem you know that's a problem pardon me
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's where temporaries come in
 		they could hire temporaries to fill in
 	
 	
 		well yes that's and that's exactly what we do in many instances you know where our work load increases an and our vacation periods and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of course we have uh what we called an SDS a Summer Development Student Program so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we we put a lot of school um
 	
 	
 		like a co-op type thing for the summer
 	
 	
 		college
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		like a co-op for the summer almost
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they work for us and and they they go to school back in the Fall
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and hopefully when they get out of college they consider us to come on full-time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they've uh established themselves with a work pattern an and the you know they're familiar to our
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		our ways and stuff and they're on our records and
 		we find that that's very very helpful
 	
 	
 		yeah i that is and uh it also gives you a chance you know to look at these kids and make your own determinations
 	
 	
 		you sound uh like a very young person
 	
 	
 		i'm twenty five
 	
 	
 		i
