 
     		
 	
 		okay what did you buy
 	
 	
 		okay a Ford Explorer a a Ford Explorer
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry what
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah one of the new ones
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um i'd i'd probably buy another this is the first American vehicle i've owned so i would probably purchase another one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i would be more selective in the dealership that i purchased it from but as far as uh the quality seems to be there um it's quiet it's it handles well um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i believe i'd get that or a Porsche one of the two
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		no not
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		if i had the money i think i would love to own a a BMW
 	
 	
 		and why would that be
 	
 	
 		i don't know i from what or either that or Mercedes just because they're put together so well it seems like they last forever
 	
 	
 		what's wrong with the Volvo
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know they're they're not as nice looking
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		oh  uh meant to me i don't know i'm sure there are some that are but everyone i've seen is kind of plain but
 	
 	
 		what
 		what what city are you calling from
 	
 	
 		Sherman
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		where're you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm Dallas um
 	
 	
 		Dallas
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		BMW or Mercedes yeah well that's uh that's um
 	
 	
 		if i had money um had the money i mean that's just i know i never would own one but uh
 		i don't know i like my actual favorite cars is were uh like the Ford Thunderbirds of nineteen eighty five i really like that style body style
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't own one of those neither
 	
 	
 		what do you presently drive
 	
 	
 		um Mercury Topaz
 	
 	
 		um fun
 	
 	
 		cheap taste cheap taste in cars okay
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well there nothing wrong with those uh
 	
 	
 		yeah they're all right it's it's a good car i mean i've never had any problem with it
 	
 	
 		they're they're nice vehicles
 		they're nice vehicles nothing wrong with those it um
 		
 
 		it's just everybody has their own taste but man the Mercedes are expensive my wife has a Volvo and it it's nice i mean you know it's okay an
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sorry i roped on Volvos then
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sorry i roped on Volvos then
 	
 	
 		oh no no no no no no no it it i i kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the GL rather than the DL but because they it is the safest car on the road um oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh is it see i don't much about them i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah they're the safest that's the reason why we mainly got it we got white and it's the safest four door and it's good for if you have a family which we do we just we just dominated everyone out and so it's it's uh um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer you know i presently i used to have a two eighty Z and i'm a tall guy and and uh
 		they're hard to get around in traffic to see because you can't see a car ahead of you but they're fast as lightning and all that crap but the Explorer i mean you're sitting up on top of everything and you can really see real well and i just it's it's so comfortable and
 	
 	
 		really
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so you're what are your feelings about American versus European cars
 	
 	
 		um
 		i like anything besides Japanese course everything has Japanese parts in them anymore i don't like Japanese cars but uh
 	
 	
 		why not
 	
 	
 		European i don't have have any i mean those are the kind i usually end up liking the most
 		American cars a lot of people say they they don't last long but i've never had any problem with
 		um my Mercury or my Cougar my husband has a uh Cougar and he's never had any problem with it either so
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		that's the way it goes i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what are your i guess this is your first time to buy American so
 	
 	
 		yeah i was real hesitant but it was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know uh i mean i think European cars are great course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff and they're easy some some of them are easy to work on a Volvo being a four cylinder is very easy to work on uh excellent warranty i mean just unbelievable warranty
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and and uh course Ford isn't too bad i think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle uh but all of it has to do in my opinion with the service and the attitude of the service of the dealership
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford
 		there's Middlekauff Ford in Plano
 	
 	
 		where
 		okay
 	
 	
 		their just their attitude is just slimy and and uh i've written a a letter to Middlekauff and i've told them that matter of fact i got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division
 		they're still concerned about my attitude and it it will never change about that place and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh anyway that's my own personal comment i guess but
 	
 	
 		yeah this girl that works for me just bought a car down there and she they they had a problem with they uh
 		took their Camaro in to get it traded and they they hadn't signed any papers and they had all ready uh taken it in to paint it and everything and everything was stolen out of it and the people um wouldn't reimburse reimburse them for anything
 	
 	
 		Middlekauff wouldn't she needs to find herself a lawyer she'd she'd come out like a champ on that one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i've heard some stuff about them but um
 	
 	
 		so have have you been using well anyway
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		that was i was asking you some questions about the telephone and how long and how many have you been doing but that's they they don't want to hear that but
 	
 	
 		oh just just about a week
