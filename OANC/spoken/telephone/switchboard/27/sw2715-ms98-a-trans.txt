 		my wife happens to be a secretary in the in in the group that does this
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay that'll work okay let me hit one now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay uh in my community they are doing a lot as as as far as recycling goes uh Waco's a pretty small city and so a lot of the city people
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess they want they take they take care of the community more than i would think that a big city does
 		or they can because they're smaller and so they're doing all kinds of recycling projects and the school kids are doing all kinds of things and i'm a i'm a news reporter and so i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		report on a lot of the recycling things that they do and just last week they opened up a new recycling center uh so now they have two uh in an adjoining community uh Hewett
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they are doing uh curbside recycling which is something a lot of cities are starting to look into but for some cities it's very expensive
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		yeah Plano just uh just started a program where they uh they gave everybody these big plastic garbage cans
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh what they're doing is on Thursday they pick up the regular garbage and these plastic garbage cans but on Mondays uh if you leave they have these special huge paper bags
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and if you put your clippings in that they'll pick that up on Mondays and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's a form of the curbside yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah right and then as i understand it they're uh they're planning to um start giving everybody containers to put aluminum and glass in to to recycle that as well so
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 		i know even uh Wal-Mart Department Store i don't if they do it there they have the recycling bin right outside the store
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and it's got glass aluminum plastic and
 	
 	
 		yeah i know all the the grocery stores here have a a bins when you walk in if you want to recycle your paper bags or plastic bags
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right the plastic bags
 	
 	
 		so uh i think it's great uh um i know the kids uh at school are being indoctrinated into the whole idea i know my daughter came home the other night
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		and um she was all excited because they gave her an eight hundred number to call to find out where your local recycling center was
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and she called it and turns out the the nearest one's in Garland which is about i don't know forty five minutes to an hour from here but
 	
 	
 		wow
 		do you recycle yourself at home do you
 	
 	
 		yeah we um in fact i've got a car full of newspapers that we're trying to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the uh here's a sort of i guess a a setback uh there were a couple of places that used to collect newspapers just around here and we went to all of them yesterday and none of them had bins for for the papers so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i don't know if they just discontinued it or
 	
 	
 		it's kind of rough doing the newspaper i understand because the they can't recycle the uh i guess it's the sale papers that have the color on them
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and so it's kind of hard for them to i guess uh separate all that
 	
 	
 		yeah i know we don't sort that out um
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i don't think anybody would you know i don't think they can put the colored paper on there or something so that should be pretty difficult
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't recycle myself i live i'm single and so  i guess if i had a family i'd probably be more aware than now that i am single but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		right i i you probably uh eat uh fast food type stuff and uh on the go
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah especially on my job i'm hardly ever home so you know my
 	
 	
 		yeah well when i was single i was a reporter too i so i uh i can identify with you um  uh i know that a lot of times that you're working double shifts and odd hours and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		you just eat when you have something to eat
 	
 	
 		you just go in and you don't know when you're coming out
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so but uh let's see what else are they doing
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh jeez i'm all out of recycling
 	
 	
 		i know uh the Boy Scouts collect newspapers here and uh and uh in in fact the there's a the kids at the end of the block come by every once in a while when they want extra money
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they they come by uh collecting aluminum cans because we have places that you can go where you can the city the city has places where you can just dump the aluminum cans but uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 		right my mother before all this recycling stuff started i guess well not before it all started but she would collect the cans and you go like in front of the supermarkets or whatever and you put the cans in this
 		bin thing and it spits out money yeah that's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah well that's where that's where these kids take their aluminum cans
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that that freaked me out when we first did that i thought okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		you you don't get rich on those right right huh
 	
 	
 		we got like eight cents or something  yeah exactly
 		uh so at work we do recycle we have a little recycling bin for our cans and bottles and uh those go out
 	
 	
 		yeah the where where i work they just started a paper drive and in fact everybody has two trash cans
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh one is for your normal crap trash and one is just for paper and they uh they had a big campaign for it and there's a list of things that you're allowed to put in the paper bin
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh you know and but they they're pretty good about it it doesn't you know you can have the staples in them and the paper clips on them and the plastic windows
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		they take care of all of that but they don't want certain types of paper uh they don't want anything you know they don't want you know like transparencies overheads you know they don't want any of that in there
 	
 	
 		wow
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		just regular paper and
 	
 	
 		right they don't want the garbage from your from your lunch in there um and uh and there's uh even little um uh this uh board
 	
 	
 		hm
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		outside the cafeteria that that shows uh has a it's a picture of a tree
 		with a with a squirrel going up and it's like a a a gauge and the higher the squirrel goes up the more trees you've saved
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it shows you how many thousands of trees uh have been saved because of the recycling program at work
 	
 	
 		so like
 		so that gives you kind of an incentive
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		well that's great if you know that like a lot of things you pick up today almost everything says
 		recyclable or this is made from recyclables or something it's it's amazing it really is it's amazing to me how fast i i'm sure recycling's been going on forever and it's just
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess everyone is picking it up now you know but it's just amazing to me how much it's come in the last year since last Earth Day you know everything's i mean recycle recycle everywhere you go
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh yeah
 		right well i know when i was a kid uh which was quite a while ago um we used to collect newspapers and take them to the there was a uh
 		i don't know what it was a plant that it was a paper plant i guess it was that was fairly close to where i lived in Richmond Virginia and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you could you bring your papers in to sell them there i remember doing that when i was a kid and uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 		i remember my mother used to take the Coke bottles in and you get like ten ten cents or something like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah sure yeah
 		right that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess that was a form of but now it's just like perpetrated into the crowd into the you know society it's like if you don't recycle you feel you feel almost uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know like you're doing something wrong or you feel guilty almost so hm
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah well that's good i mean we're such a we're such a um throwaway society
 	
 	
 		yeah wasteful um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's nice because you know uh if you talk to people who grew up during the depression
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		nothing was wasted i mean everything and nowadays it's like you know nobody darns their socks i mean if you see a hole in it you throw it away by a new pair of socks you know kind of thing and uh i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		throw it away that's it
 		yeah we're spoiled very spoiled
 	
 	
 		yeah i you know i guess i believe the propaganda if you want to call it that that uh um you know we're uh
 		we're we we have limited resources and uh we really should think about uh conserving them instead of wasting them
 	
 	
 		right i know i'm doing the story big story i'm covering now is of about our landfill here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh what was it i think twenty four million tons of garbage that we throw away
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		everywhere everywhere America could be recycled
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow
 	
 	
 		like twenty four million to and i think that accounts for uh i think one quarter or half of the landfill space
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so i mean i just learn all these little
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh propaganda things
 	
 	
 		you can't always i mean it'd be nice if you could if the landfill space was reusable but it isn't it all it it isn't always i know sometimes it is
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 		not at all
 	
 	
 		i know there's place called Mount Trashmore Trashmore which is a a park that they built on top of a landfill
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and i can't remember where it is i think it's in Washington DC or thereabouts
 	
 	
 		Mount Trashmore i haven't heard of that one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's like the big stink around here this landfill thing they're wanting to expand it and a lot of the community the people that live around the area don't want it expanded because you know they say it'll uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh poison their water and you know poison the air and there's an elementary school right across the street and all kinds of stuff so it's a pretty pretty big issue
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well yeah i i guess uh you know the scary the the scary part is that you don't know what the effects are you know fifty years from now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		you know it's easy to say well we'll build a concrete hole and and nothing'll happen and then they'll say well the only way to test that is over a long period of time so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right right that's what a lot of people are saying that it may not hurt now but they're looking in the long run you know and they're saying well forty years from now we'll
 	
 	
 		right
 		right and there's
 		and there's no way to measure that i mean you you know you the only way is to take the chance and see what happens forty years from now and who knows what kind of havoc you've created
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		hm
 		yeah people don't want to wait
 	
 	
 		uh by the
 		no nope
