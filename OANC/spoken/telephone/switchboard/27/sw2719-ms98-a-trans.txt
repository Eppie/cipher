 
     		
 	
 		do you exercise a lot
 	
 	
 		um it's uh scaled back considerably uh right now my exercise is pretty much limited to uh softball league and occasional ride on the bike
 		but uh i uh
 		i was just recently well recently nine months ago got married and bought a house so my outside activities have been curtailed somewhat
 	
 	
 		is mowing the lawn a new exercise
 	
 	
 		yeah lawn it's a forty year old house so we are doing a lot of refurbish work and uh yeah painting lawn gutters you name it  all kinds of stuff flower beds
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		i think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's true that's true it's there's always something to do and uh
 		and and uh it keeps me going
 	
 	
 		well you're you are so far ahead of me i used to uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i used to walk two miles a day and i really enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because the two miles went fairly quickly i could do it in twenty eight minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way but it's a lot you know it's not too strenuous
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but i don't know what i did to my knee i
 		was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i mashed it wrong or i did something
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		and the doctor has had me on medication and she doesn't want me to walk she said that's you know while it's healing you're going to mess it up so i can't walk
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh she said you know the most conservative approach you do the medicine you do the medicine again and again
 		before you think of surgery and i don't want her to think of surgery on my knee i don't want anyone to think about that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no that that's a tough situation
 	
 	
 		ever
 		that's that microscopic stuff you know uh-huh not my kneecap
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i'm i'm being very good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i miss it i really do and i
 	
 	
 		oh that it's so aggravating to uh to have an injury like that my wife uh
 		runs or likes to run but uh she's well we moved we moved down to the north end of Oak Cliff in the Castle Park area
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and she started running down there and all the hills
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she lasted about two weeks and her ankles couldn't take it anymore
 		she was used to running you know flat tracks and whatnot and uh
 		ever since that it's just been real difficult it's real aggravating because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff
 		even if she does get on flat ground so she's kind of in the same mode She was all ready to
 		get back into it and start running uh five K's and ten K's and stuff this spring and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape
 		and when you want to do it it's really really aggravating you know it it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise and it's another thing to to already
 		be past that and then not be able to because of your health
 	
 	
 		i can you understand that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't really want to i just know i need to
 	
 	
 		well it's
 	
 	
 		you know i make myself do it and if i do it okay i don't love it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know  but i will do it
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh it's not anything i would want to but i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk
 		i have got to be so much more careful with what i do
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh-huh it is and you know you you
 	
 	
 		it's depressing
 	
 	
 		you don't  well speaking for myself i don't sleep as well when i am not exercising and uh
 		it's really it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff it your body just gets used to it and yeah i i don't particularly enjoy
 		well i i used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that i do enjoy riding bike but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that
 		uh i i can't say i really enjoyed it all that much but once i got used to it
 		it was habit forming it was i felt so bad if i didn't
 		physically i mean i just my body was was was uh tuned into that that mode
 		and if i if i skipped it then it  kind of threw the the whole the whole system out of whack
 	
 	
 		right right boy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hopefully my my knee is a hundred percent better maybe i can get back into it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's for sure
 	
 	
 		i have ask you a question off the subject though you're in you're living in the Castle Park area
 	
 	
 		okay
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i grew up in Oak Cliff
 	
 	
 		did you really
 	
 	
 		yes uh just
 		close to Methodist Hospital
 	
 	
 		okay yeah
 	
 	
 		on Candy C A N D Y
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		oh
 		in fact i lived there
 		oh until nineteen
 		late nineteen fifties
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		and that area is it changing back again so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them
 	
 	
 		yeah it is um we're on we're on a little street called Bison Trail
 		it's only about a block and a half long but it's it's over on the other end It it's over by the far edge of uh Stephen's Park Golf Course
 	
 	
 		oh i know exactly where that is
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's uh you know where the little bridge is on North Oak Cliff Boulevard yeah we are just south of that little bridge back up on the hill in the trees there
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 	
 	
 		and yeah um our street is uh an awful lot of retired people but the other half in fact our  you know one little block and a half there
 		four houses sold last summer and three sold the summer before and everybody in their
 		late twenties to mid thirties are buying and and starting to rebuild and fix things up again and everybody is real excited
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 		that's wonderful that is a gorgeous gorgeous place
 	
 	
 		yeah and then
 		oh it's it's a lot of fun the people are great there too our uh
 		we've got a real active neighborhood association and uh we have well we've got four regular parties every year and we do a neighborhood recycling program and
 		you know all that kind of stuff so it's a lot of fun and it is it's a really beautiful area
 		and some some of the people um
 		some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses and they're they're getting them at a real bargain
 	
 	
 		well sure they are
 	
 	
 		you know they're they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy five thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		good great
 	
 	
 		and uh and they're just going to town with them they're people are putting in pools and
 		and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original you know nineteen thirty nineteen forties look
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and uh it it's it 's really coming around i guess
 	
 	
 		i need to go over there and just drive around and look
 	
 	
 		it's it's worth the trip
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure it must be
 		i'm just we had a lovely little house over there it was like a two story
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well story and a half really because we had a basement
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and the guy that built it was weird
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean weird
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's one of these really creative houses that i grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and i just loved the neighborhood and i mean everyone everyone had houses like that They were all completely different
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh that's right
 	
 	
 		and so neat
 	
 	
 		yeah ours ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big oh i guess it's twenty eight by fifteen front porch and uh next door we've got an Austin stone
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		across the street the guy just uh it was burnt out about two years ago and and the guy moved in and completely redid it and it's got oh it's got a rounded
 		front on it it's all brick and he's he's landscaped his yard and he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that so
 		yeah there's a variety you just don't see it anywhere else as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot
 	
 	
 		now why couldn't your wife run around the golf course is that not good
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh she could a little bit we i tell you what we got into the fitness center at Methodist
 	
 	
 		oh was he
 	
 	
 		and they have a quarter mile track there
 		so she has started doing that rather than uh rather than take off
 		the problem is she's a school teacher and for her she can't run in the morning For her to get home and try to run at six o'clock in the night in the winter time it's starting to get dark and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know you don't want to she doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in Dallas regardless whether it's north Dallas or whatnot and
 		when she goes over to this fitness center it's fenced in and there's somebody in the building watching her and all that so there's a lot of consideration
 	
 	
 		yes i i really hear that you know i think you know you're in Oak Cliff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i'm in Plano In west Plano
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block we all know each other and the street doesn't go anywhere
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		if you are on the street you better belong there
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		because it's not a through street
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and still i want to get up early in the morning and walk before this knee business and my husband
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		had a lot of heartburn with that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		it looked darker to him because he he was in the house with the lights on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		when i was out walking it was more of a pre dawn type pretty
 		but huh-uh he didn't think it looked pre dawn to him it looked dark and even he was real concerned about that so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's not just because you are in Oak Cliff it's just because you're smart that you don't do things like that
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right it only takes one time that is it's a hard lesson to learn so
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		there's only one crazy out there you know to make any difference
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah it's you know it goes all over well we got this
