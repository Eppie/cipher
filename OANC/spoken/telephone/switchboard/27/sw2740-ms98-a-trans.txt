 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i was thinking about the uh the topic you know while they were searching for a person
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh while i was thinking about it i just flipped on my TV
 		and it was funny because i thought about today how so much of
 		i mean i even my social life is renting movies or sitting at home and you know watching a rented movie or watching a movie on TV
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and just now it's so i mean every everything is just so uh easy that you almost don't have to think of things to do anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		i do and like even even little kids who watch like Sesame Street and everything's really fast paced and they don't have to to sit down and concentrate on one thing for a long time and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i mean i remember when i was little my friends uh my parents i'm sorry would just go over people's houses and just sort of you know sit and talk
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and before TV and all that people would sit and listen to the radio and and that i mean life has just changed and become so much more modernized and uh it's really pretty incredible
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah just the other day i uh some AM station or something had a um
 		like a radio show just like the old days you know it was like from the old days and i was thinking gosh that's i mean because you have to imagine what everybody looks like and you don't understand it until you actually hear it and have to do it and it's i mean you know it's just too bad that everybody has everything fed to them
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		i know
 		uh-huh
 		and you know when you think about oh i was watching reruns of Happy Days the other day and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to think that that was the social life of teenagers to go to uh you know a a place like Arnold's and order a soda pop
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know sit and hang out and and you know just the dress codes the whole atmosphere the whole attitude of teenagers and social life was totally different then
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean now we always have to do something new or better or more exciting can't just sit around and talk for awhile you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		i know
 	
 	
 		it's too bad
 	
 	
 		i know and also um i think that it's so much more dangerous for people now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean before you could go out and and you know you didn't have all the drunk drivers and you didn't have to worry about your kids getting into the wrong crowds and this and that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and now that's really a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is
 	
 	
 		you know  but what what do you do most of the time for social activities
 	
 	
 		um just
 		well i'm fifteen so
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		oh just a lot of times we do sit around and
 		because like uh i'm really glad that i'm in like uh the classes uh like honors classes and so it's like what's really good about that is that you meet people who really are interested in in talking about things and discussing world issues and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it just and it makes me sick to go to school and know people who just that's all they do is like go out and  you know try to go find a new guy or something it's just so immature and oh just futile you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i i definitely agree
 		um are your you can't drive yet then can you
 	
 	
 		no i'll be driving in a few months
 	
 	
 		okay oh in a few months you said oh that's good well you're going to find that driving changes your social life completely
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean suddenly when you're free to go where you want to go it's amazing i mean i don't know if you'll always have a car around that's a different issue
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um uh just even being able to go to a movie when you want and and not relying on somebody else it's really pretty nice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but um
 		one thing i love to do and maybe it's just  because i like to eat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but one of my favorite things to do with friends is just go out and try a new restaurant
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and i don't know just go and i don't know try like a a new ethnic restaurant you know Indian food or or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think so often we do social things like you were saying you know going out and picking up guys or or whatever social things that don't really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		are that aren't really social like when you go to a movie you're not sitting and talking to anybody
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and when you go to a bar it's usually so loud or so crowded that you even that you can't talk to anybody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know um and going out to dinner i think is a nice way you're out you're out of the house um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think playing games is something that my friends and i love to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we've um we've bought Pictionary you probably know that and i don't know some other games and um and i know this sounds kind of corny but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		it was it does sound corny but it's so much fun
 	
 	
 		it really is
 		and if you get the right group of friends
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they have a good attitude about it then you know you can have a pretty good time
 	
 	
 		yeah you really can
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		awesome
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i personally think that i should have been born in the fifties because i do i do love that era and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i really think that i could have gotten into i don't know the the music and the lifestyle and um things just seemed so much easier didn't they
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it just seems like you didn't have so much to worry about
 	
 	
 		i know everybody's i mean everybody's always busy and worried and so many problems people don't just sit down and you know just talk and know everything's going to be okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true
 		well who knows maybe another maybe the the twenty first century will bring a whole new type of social life
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah things go in cycles you know maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i get very frustrated when i go over to a friend's house and all they want to do is sit and play computer games
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i i don't know if you're familiar with any of them but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they're they're fun you know and they're they're you know not bad to like take up some time but they just are so um exclusive
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you get two people in front of a computer playing a computer game and the the next room could be on fire
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they'll never know it you know
 	
 	
 		oh that 's the truth
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but
 		
 
 		well it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah and gosh i hope you guys cool off down there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		talk to you later bye
 	
 	
 		all righty bye-bye
