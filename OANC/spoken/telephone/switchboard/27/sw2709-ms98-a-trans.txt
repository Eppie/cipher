 		there are so many Orientals that have come here and there's a lot of Mexican people too which is not neither here nor there but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent
 		uh very wise in money matters and have taken have taken over a lot of businesses and have really
 		kind it's kind of scary because they're so bright they're all the kids that i have that are Oriental are really far above
 		the American kids and they and the the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up and money is their main goal
 		and it's kind it really is kind of scary because there's there's just oodles of them and you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals
 		and it's kind it's kind of scares me not that i don't want them here and not that i don't appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too but  on the other hand you feel like almost they're they're invading us to the point where they're going to take over
 	
 	
 		right actually my son once said that that perhaps um what we should do is is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest and and that might be the solution
 	
 	
 		i think probably that's a good idea because i lived in Iowa for about for about ten years before i came here and i was born in Ohio
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it it really and there is there are a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border and and they are wonderful people and and i'm not you know i don't want to deny them their rights just that you you feel like when you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		were born and raised here and you worked real very hard to make this country what it is
 		uh it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over and a lot of these people plan one day to go back you know to to Vietnam or to you know Taiwan or wherever they're from
 		and take with them a lot of American dollars plus a lot of power in American companies companies companies and it's kind of scary  and you know i don't know i don't know the immigration laws that uh that well and i do not and in fact i don't know them at all i don't know how many
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		people they allow in the United States per year or if there's even a i don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore do you know anything about that
 	
 	
 		um-hum no i don't i don't know i lived in the Middle East for sometime and i i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because uh i know a lot of people that
 		were in a sense not qualified is the wrong word but certainly were deserving to come and it seemed to take them a long time or or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so i would guess that you know there are quotas for different places
 	
 	
 		i would think so too it
 	
 	
 		uh you know i i i think there's something about being able to to claim um
 		imminent danger or i'm not sure what the terminology is maybe political
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		asylum yeah there there you go you got the term and maybe that's an an issue with a a lot of people i don't know
 	
 	
 		asylum of some sort
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but yeah i i guess i haven't been in a situation where it's it's been threatening to to me uh
 	
 	
 		well
 		well i teach in the suburb of Dallas and and uh my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas
 		and uh with very very good school systems and they're considered you know one of the top three in the state both of them you know and it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here and the kids in this area are very bright and come from you know parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and and uh very interested in their education but
 		uh i think in the last year i'm not if i'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools
 		the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were uh almost half or more Oriental
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know they're just extremely bright kids and also they value learning
 	
 	
 		i was going to say i'm not sure i i would guess that it's not that they are any brighter but they just maybe work harder or
 	
 	
 		well i i think things come easy for them too but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States i don't
 		they uh don't want to work for anything they want it to come to them but and be there but they don't want to work hard and these kids work really hard and and they have
 	
 	
 		right right maybe but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've we've let this value slip
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i agree with that i agree with that
 	
 	
 		and they need to have some competition
 	
 	
 		but what i see is you the competition is there but instead of meeting the challenge they're starting to resent them and it's causing you know i think some some problems
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's too bad
 	
 	
 		it really is it because we see a lot of racial problems in Dallas the Dallas area anyway especially in Dallas and it's mainly Black and and and Hispanic
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh there is some there has been some resentment with Orientals in the Black community because they've started businesses there and the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money and there's been some violence because of it
 	
 	
 		oh that's really sad
 	
 	
 		it is it's it is very sad so you know i really i i've i've always prided myself on not being prejudice and being
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know um welcoming welcoming everyone that wants to come here and even when i was younger when when i was in college i was a member of the NAACP because i lived up north and i was very into that the human rights part of everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i i've i've become very cynical in the last three four years living in Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change maybe the
 		uh you know the
 		there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to to allow for adequate melting into the society
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		well and exactly that's exactly true plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back
 		and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and and uh plus a lot of American dollars but in in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too you know you just don't know
 	
 	
 		right right exactly
 	
 	
 		and and yet you know with uh with uh
 		there's somebody on my other line but i'm going to ignore that um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		anyway i just you you kind of you don't you really don't know what to do and and
 		i don't i want my kids to have values where they're accepting and so forth and both of my children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		are really tolerant more tolerant of Blacks and Hispanics Hispanics than they are of the Orientals for some reason they feel you know like they've taken over they feel like uh you know they're taking some of the
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		the rewards that they should have and and i really don't want that to happen but but it's happening
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right right
 	
 	
 		and i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i  hi  i really do wish i i knew more about immigration laws because i have no idea any more because they've changed a great deal
 	
 	
 		right
 		i would i would suspect that they have
 		well i guess um
 		i don't have much  much more to contribute to the topic
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i don't really either i wish i knew more and probably if i did i might be a little bit more uh tolerant
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		perhaps and i and even if i i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from you don't know any of that and you feel you know you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them unless
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and for some reason Orientals are very
 		uh my good friend calls them pushy but i call them very that they know what they want and they go get it and in stores and so forth
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		goal directed
 	
 	
 		well pardon me  yeah but in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they can they get in front of you or they
 	
 	
 		goal directle
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		um they take something that you had in mind to get before you did you know just going for it they take it quickly and uh they don't think anything of that and i don't you know that's makes people resentful too and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		and yet they have they have a right to be here and i know that but it's it sometimes it's gets touchy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so and i'm sure it's a lot different you're from Maryland you said what part of Maryland are you from
 	
 	
 		yes
 		up in the Gaithersburg area
 	
 	
 		oh okay my sister used to live there in that area and i i'm sure that it's a lot different there uh it's a lot different in Iowa than in Iowa than it is here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well no i think i think there as i recall in my son's class there were were an awful an awful lot of minorities minorities yeah and uh of all of all varieties and
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		with the same uh you know some of the some of the same problems that you've mentioned but um i don't know i guess i wasn't involved enough to to um
 		really stop to think about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i you know since i teach i see that see it and and i feel and i love the example that most of these children and give the
 		our American children and yet you know i can see why some of the parents are fearful that are fearful too and and it's a kind of a touchy situation
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened but it doesn't happen that way all the time
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so anyway it was good to talk to to you too and have a good trip in California all right well thank you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		well it was good talking to you
 		and i hope
 		okay and have a good weekend all righty bye-bye
