 
     		
 	
 		well i'm having a hard time remembering  the last movie i saw
 	
 	
 		well i was too  i i thought i saw a lot of movies but i guess i i haven't seen any really recently
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess uh i can remember seeing Dances With Wolves that was uh well that's uh that's an excellent film i i highly i highly recommend that in fact i guess they're bringing that back out
 	
 	
 		well i haven't seen that
 		that's what everybody says
 		oh are they
 	
 	
 		and uh they're adding fifty minutes to it or something like that
 	
 	
 		see that's why i don't want to go see it because it's three hours just to start of it i can't
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i can't sit through a movie that long
 	
 	
 		so it's going to be almost four hours before it's over
 	
 	
 		i know i don't think i'll see it
 	
 	
 		or beyond yeah beyond that uh
 	
 	
 		well i hear it's a man's movie anyway
 	
 	
 		oh i wouldn't say that no because i my wife my my wife and i went and i think she enjoyed it even more than i did
 	
 	
 		really
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so uh unlike Field of Dreams i guess the last Kevin Costner movie we'd seen before that was Field of Dreams i i guess i'd have to admit that probably was more of a guy's movie than a
 	
 	
 		oh was it yeah
 	
 	
 		than a than a lady's movie
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of like you know Steel Magnolia is to me was a woman's movie
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's what we we saw that and i have to agree with you i think that's more of a lady's movie than a than a guy's movie
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah uh i was trying to think of the last movie i saw oh i saw i saw Ghost that was good
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		oh okay yeah we saw that on video that's that's that's another thing i guess that uh it's kind of
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 	
 	
 		kind of curbed uh us going out so much is that uh there was so many movies i didn't see when they came out beforehand that uh i know are coming out on video that you
 	
 	
 		yeah going out
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you look in the paper and you and you go well i can either see this or i can see this movie that i really wanted to see three years ago and didn't see
 	
 	
 		right
 		i want to see Silence of the Lambs have you seen that
 	
 	
 		i haven't and and i
 	
 	
 		i hear it's excellent
 	
 	
 		i i hear it's excellent and it's probably something i'd i'd enjoy but i i heard that it was so uh kind of gruesome in scenes that that and that was the part i probably wouldn't like but i heard that uh the acting was was great and it was a really thrilling movie
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that in fact i read something in the paper here the other day that uh Anthony Hopkins i guess the guy who plays the the psycho or the villain that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		that uh he's getting letters from just all over you know the world and all that and and he suddenly become uh like a real screen idol or a uh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like a a leading man you know he thinks it's funny but i guess uh woman in particular think it's such a scary movie and that uh that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that they just identify with not identify with him but they they like his character i i wouldn't say like like his character but they're so fascinated by his character that uh they write him letters and and say how much they liked him and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what it is
 		um-hum
 		well this guy at work told me not to go see it by myself at night or see it by myself at night  so i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's probably that's probably a good idea unfortunately i think i i don't really enjoy movies with a whole lot of blood in them so uh
 	
 	
 		i don't either i myself i like romantic comedies myself but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'll i'll go see a drama like uh when the Untouchables came out which is another Kevin Costner movie well this is going to be a rut isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my gosh you're you must be a big fan of his
 	
 	
 		i just so happen i guess we just see those but my wife actually talked me into going to see that and i didn't really want to go see it and it was you know it was kind of a a bloody movie but uh it was done in such a way that you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and with gangsters and guns and all that i mean you are not going to avoid that so wasn't as
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i
 	
 	
 		it wasn't like they spent you know long shots relishing every drop or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess the last movie i saw was at Scenes From the Mall with Woody Allen and Bette Midler and i i guess you just have to be a big Woody Allen fan which i'm not i think you either hate him or like him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we
 		we we did in fact i think that is the last movie that we saw was Scenes from Mall and
 	
 	
 		and i thought i thought it was terrible
 	
 	
 		yeah so did we we thought it was really lousy and it
 	
 	
 		yeah i i like her but i really don't like him for some reason in the first place trying to pass him off at age forty just almost was too much more than i could handle you know
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah
 		he he's not forty anymore that's for sure
 	
 	
 		Lord no he hasn't seen forty in ten years has he
 	
 	
 		plus uh
 		plus there's something about seeing those two walking through a mall just like and nobody paying attention is just like no no and especially with him carrying a yellow surfboard that was just like
 	
 	
 		yes
 		huh-uh
 		isn't that the truth
 	
 	
 		this this is real realistic and you know if i saw Woody Allen and Bette Midler go by and he's still carrying a yellow surfboard i wouldn't notice him i wouldn't even see him
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		i believe i would too but and then the money they spent on that food that shrimp or or that sushi or something like hundred i mean eleven hundred dollars or something ended up spending nobody spends that kind of money i don't think
 	
 	
 		and
 		oh yeah it was just a
 		it was just a
 		
 
 		yeah and i i just can't believe uh that you could use up two hours watching two people go from store to store in a mall
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		you know just uh in fact that was the funny part of it was sitting there and just seeing mall shots going you know i could go to North Park or i could go to Collin Creek or something like that and see that so
 	
 	
 		no
 		
 
 		right
 		right that was a terrible
 	
 	
 		so uh it was just not really fun at all
 	
 	
 		no i came i had asked my neighbor to go with me and she decided to she had to fly so i thought i'll go see it by myself
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm glad i didn't ask her to waste her time now because
 	
 	
 		
 
 		or money
 	
 	
 		yeah i didn't i mean that was a horrible movie i
 	
 	
 		and we went to an early show on that one so we didn't uh
 	
 	
 		in fact i think i went to one of the early shows i didn't have to spend a bunch of money on it i think i got in for two seventy five or something i would have hated to have spent seven dollars on that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh gee yeah tell the truth but that
 	
 	
 		but she usually plays some pretty cute movies like that one with Nick Nolte that was Beverly Down and Out in Beverly Hills wasn't she in that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah i didn't get to see that i didn't get to see that but uh but
 	
 	
 		she was cute in that and uh i think i hear she was good in Beaches i didn't see that
 	
 	
 		i didn't see that either that was something we'll probably rent a video on one of these days but uh
 	
 	
 		i want to see that movie uh A Kiss Before
 	
 	
 		oh Kiss Before Dying or something like that i've just seen advertised but i guess i haven't kept up on the movies that are out right just coming out right now
 	
 	
 		you die before yeah something like that
 		i know i just see it advertise on TV and it really looks like it is going to be a
 		thriller a good thriller
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum that uh sounds sounds like you are pretty much split between romantic comedies and thrillers then
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i am i really don't like to see thrillers by myself but uh i will go see them i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i guess i guess the only real movie that we we wanted to go see and haven't gone to see yet is is Class Action II with Gene Hackman
 	
 	
 		yeah i want to see that that's another good one
 	
 	
 		because uh he's usually i hear he's good in it but that's i guess he's good in almost everything he does so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i know it i've never seen him in anything bad yet
 	
 	
 		and uh so we're we're looking for one of these days to to see that
 	
 	
 		and another person i used to i really did like was Barbara Streisand and then i saw her in that movie Nuts and that was a wasted don't waste your even at a dollar movie that one would have been bad oh
 	
 	
 		i didn't see that no
 		
 
 		that good i think that's what everyone said that it was a pretty lousy movie
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh it was horrible and i really did like her until that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but gosh not any more ooh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah boy she hasn't been in a movie well maybe that's why she hasn't been in a movie in a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's right i don't think she's made one since then either as a matter of the fact that i know
 	
 	
 		yeah i i guess i guess i don't tend to even though it seems like we've been to a lot of Kevin Costner's movies maybe that's my wife's uh input more than i but uh but i guess i don't rely on anymore on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		star value i don't really go see movies because it's like Robert Redford was in Havana and and boy that looked like a bad movie just in the coming attractions and i said and i said boy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i know it how about did you see uh Pretty Woman with Richard Gere and
 	
 	
 		i haven't seen that i haven't was that good
 	
 	
 		oh that's good yeah i liked that that was a good movie
 	
 	
 		and  that i heard that uh and i don't particularly like Richard Gere i guess the only movie that i that i liked that he was in was Officer and a Gentleman and even then you know that was kind of pushing it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh but i heard every even if you didn't like Richard Gere you probably would've liked that movie
 	
 	
 		oh i'm a fan of his
 		yeah he is good i really i really did like him i'm a fan of his
 	
 	
 		uh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah he's uh he's okay in my book
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and of course Julia Roberts is cute too but i i didn't really know i hadn't heard of her too much until i saw this movie and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		then i saw Dick Tracy did you see that
 	
 	
 		i haven't seen that no no we didn't go see that
 	
 	
 		nah it was
 	
 	
 		i heard that was more of a kid's movie and uh
 	
 	
 		well
 		the kids wouldn't appreciate it because they they've never heard of Dick Tracy other than you know like i've heard of him all my life but
 	
 	
 		yeah when you when he was actually in the funny paper and
 	
 	
 		yeah but they don't know him except for uh probably uh the movie you know so i don't think they would appreciate it as much as as older people would because they you know grew up with him but i was kind of disappointed in it a little bit uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		that probably
 		yeah i i probably couldn't get my wife to go see that i think the last time i got to see her something like that was Batman it took me a it took me a
 	
 	
 		yeah and i didn't like that you know why i didn't like that movie it was so dark i couldn't see
 	
 	
 		well that's true i think that was the feel that they they were after was everything was really dark and and and kind of foreboding and
 	
 	
 		i guess
 		and i don't like to have to strain my eyes and try to see the characters on the screen that that was one i i watched on a video at home and i maybe that was it maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		that that might have been something because i think that i don't think that's movie that would have been as good on a on a small screen
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		i mean you really it really had to be on a big screen i think especially for Jack Nicholson to come across because because i mean what he did was so corny
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know like it it's like they they spent a half hour setting up that line about bats in the belfry you know it's where Batman is climbing up to save what's her name and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he's up there and it's like all these things are are falling on him and it's like they they work all this time just when he gets to the top that the Joker can say something about well looks like we got bats in the belfry and it's like
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i think they've been pushing to try to get this joke in for a long time yeah i hear a i hear a second Batman movie is getting ready to come out too yeah i guess Danny De Vito's in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		oh is it
 		oh now that would be good i like him oh did you see uh War of the Roses
 	
 	
 		i guess he's
 		yeah i no
 	
 	
 		i loved it but most people that i knew didn't like it but i thought i was funny
 	
 	
 		i i liked it till about a half hour from the from the end it looked it looked like it was going to be a funny movie and and until about until it got to be almost too much
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh well now that was the first movie i or the first movie in ages that i have seen twice i went back to see it and when i saw it the second time it wasn't as cute but it was i just roared through it the first time and that's why i probably
 	
 	
 		you know when they were
 		really
 		yeah
 		it
 		i again i think the first hour was really everyone was laughing and and my wife and i were really enjoying it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then i think it was when he finally drove the car over the yard or something like that and she finally trying uh i mean it gets from from little things like throwing things at him and dropping things on him to to where she's actually
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		trying to kill him
 	
 	
 		trying to kill him and then i almost got real furious and and it was like a whole mood change right here and that whole chandelier scene at the end it was like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i k now it
 		oh i know it and i was so shocked at the ending i didn't think they would die
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i really didn't i was so shocked
 	
 	
 		and and and it was funny because we usually like Michael uh Douglas and and Kathleen Turner i think we've we've liked everything like uh
 	
 	
 		Douglas yeah he plays
 		i have too
 	
 	
 		like Diane saw Jagged Edge you know my wife
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh yes that was good oh that was good
 	
 	
 		and and i and i didn't but i guess you know she i mean she she's seen a lot more Kathleen Turner movies than i have and she  the only ones i ever saw were Romancing the Stone and and and those kind of movies but she likes them and
 	
 	
 		oh you didn't
 		that's a good one
 		uh-huh
 		oh okay
 		she's a good actress
 	
 	
 		and uh she i was really disappointed i think we we were both disappointed in fact for some reason although it looked like it was going to b e funny
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah well i did i don't know maybe i got a warped sense of humor because i like i said i just roared through it the first time and then the second time when i saw it but it see it was a month later that i saw it the second time maybe if i had waited longer and seen it a second time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
