 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay Jean um could you tell me what you what you think about uh gun control
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think we have a lot of laws on the books right now that if they were
 		kept and followed would take care of a lot of the problems we have
 	
 	
 		as as far as firearms go
 		or as far as firearms going or is it just uh the
 	
 	
 		pardon
 		yes
 		the gun the gun control
 	
 	
 		gun controls yeah i'm not really all that sure on on
 		uh what the federal regulations are but it seems like each state has their own
 		or at  at least that's what my belief is is that each state has their own regulations
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know some require uh uh a permit
 		and some don't some require waiting periods and some don't um
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		we require permits like if you're going to carry a pistol for protection or for whatever reason you you know have you to have a permit for that
 	
 	
 		right that's
 		that's what it is up here it's like that too you need uh as far as a rifle or anything like that no you can just go out and buy it um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		i i just i just don't feel that uh a stronger restrictions is going to stop a person who really wants to have one for misuse
 		i really don't personally feel that it's going to help
 	
 	
 		no unless it's a like one of those automatic weapons
 	
 	
 		well those we don't need
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i can see there are uh gun collectors that you know go out and collect all these and there are people that go out and fire on ranges and things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um if you want an automatic weapon just for that because you certainly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		don't need it going out hunting
 	
 	
 		no no no
 	
 	
 		um then i think
 	
 	
 		somebody's who's into into shooting though like you say sharpshooters or uh that type of thing wouldn't be so bad but uh
 	
 	
 		yep
 		i yeah i think that should be regulated
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		those types of weapons as far as a pistol
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		anybody and uh
 		and their uncle can get a pistol anytime they want um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		i don't think the laws
 		are going to keep them from getting them if they really want one
 	
 	
 		no no what i
 	
 	
 		i just i really don't believe that
 	
 	
 		what i think should happen is uh any violent crime with a weapon with a with a pistol
 		or or a rifle for that matter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think they should prosecute to the fullest extent of the law
 	
 	
 		oh definitely definitely
 	
 	
 		and that's that's what they're not doing now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's i say if they would use the laws they have on the books
 		i think it would stop quite a bit of what goes on
 		but they're i don't know it it sometimes seems like they're too lenient with some things but yet if a guy steals a loaf of bread for their family
 		he's in worse trouble than they are
 	
 	
 		right they crucify him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		but yeah i don't know if it's i don't know if it's the judicial system like the judges that are too lenient
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because there are precedents saying you know well it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he really didn't mean to do it it was a fit of anger or or uh he had too much to drink or he was on dope and he didn't know what he was doing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't really buy that i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if he if he drank too much he knew he drank too much or or if he was on dope he knew he was he was what was going to happen when he when he took it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's kind of a cop out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but yet i've seen some
 		jury trials where the people feel sorry for the whoever did whatever they did
 	
 	
 		oh you definitely
 	
 	
 		and they and they're lenient they go lenient on them and then after they sit there and i read the paper and i say she you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i think a lot of people put themselves in the place in the place of the person that has done the crime
 		and they think of how they would react and then they don't think anybody could do the things that this person is accused of doing
 	
 	
 		yep yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think that sometimes colors some of their feelings on uh
 	
 	
 		you're probably right uh a lot of cases too it is
 		um in a fit of anger people do things that they regret for the rest of their life
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but yet
 		there are also the others
 		that commit crimes over and over and over again and
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		they're out on the street after a short sentence
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		those are the ones that you know should get the book thrown at them on
 	
 	
 		they should be kept there and overcrowding of course that has a lot to do with i think a lot of times with uh the type of sentence that's given
 		you know what's available for keeping them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		let's
 		yeah um
 		i grew up in a rural area and we've always uh we've always hunted i've hunted for years until i got older and then i i just hung my guns up and i just kind of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know i'd rather go out with a camera now and and shoot the animals
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't have a my my my husband and my one boy he hunted uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well we we passed a or the town passed an ordinance that it's against the law now to to shoot a firearm off in the town and it's it's still a rural area and it's still farms and orchards and
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we live
 		right down by next to the reservoir so there's a lot of ducks and you know there's all kinds of wild animals
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and for years it was like a shooting gallery down there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well some people have no sense at all in shooting  to know how far to be away from buildings and that to shoot i mean
 		some of them use no s ense at all
 	
 	
 		right
 		yep yep because we didn't but a neighbor of ours had uh uh a bullet came came through right right through the side of the house and it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well we've had that happen in our area also um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so but since they've done that since they've limited hunting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's been uh the birds are back the animals are back it's uh it's peaceful
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so our town got together
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so maybe uh communities have to do that if you
 	
 	
 		well i think it depends on the community now we're rural also and our houses are not
 		they're not that close like we have a shooting range across the road from our home
 		but it's far enough away we have fields around it
 	
 	
 		it's a regular oh but
 	
 	
 		and it's
 		it's far enough away from you know houses and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that type of thing that uh
 	
 	
 		it's a what is it like a rod and gun club
 	
 	
 		no it's just our own personal
 	
 	
 		oh okay so it's
 	
 	
 		we just have a a personal lot yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's for you oh okay
 	
 	
 		now we do have a sportsman's uh club who has a an indoor shooting range
 		and it's very nice our our one boy was a sharpshooter
 		he was interested yeah he was interested in that then uh
 	
 	
 		oh isn't that good yeah
 	
 	
 		did a
 	
 	
 		so what is he does he have to follow certain rules and regulations  because he's a uh sharpshooter or
 	
 	
 		uh no not really he doesn't do it now because he's not here he lives in Pittsburgh
 		now and so he he really hasn't been doing too much shooting lately
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		but he he really did enjoy it
 	
 	
 		but
 		but he had to have a special permit to carry a gun from place to place
 	
 	
 		um
 		i don't think they had to have not for shooting not for their rifles and that
 		it would be just like uh going hunting you don't need a permit to carry you know you're not allowed to carry them loaded or anything like that
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah i know
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so you just need a hunting license
 	
 	
 		no no i don't think so uh the rifles that they use like in their uh
 		uh ROTC
 		now i think they had to they i think they had to do a little bit more when they use them they also had a club at the college here
 	
 	
 		oh okay yep
 	
 	
 		that he shot in and
 	
 	
 		ah okay
 	
 	
 		they had a few more restrictions there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah so he was probably following
 		whatever the protocol was for the military
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i kind of agree with you then that uh uh the only the only thing i would like to see them regulate is is the automatic weapons
 	
 	
 		yeah there's no there's really no call for
 		for that that type of weapon
 	
 	
 		but as far as everything else uh if they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if they followed the rules and regulations and the laws that were already in place
 		i think that uh uh
 		that would suffice we wouldn't have to go any further we wouldn't have to put more regulations out there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh now the lady said they she wanted us to rate from one to ten as to how we felt on a one being uh
 	
 	
 		that's right a a total ban
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on on
 	
 	
 		ten ten would be no regulations at all let's see no wait how was it
 	
 	
 		yeah right ten was no no restrictions whatsoever and one being was uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh a total ban
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know or totally restrictive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i kind of think uh
 		probably a six i would go with
 	
 	
 		i would go along with that
 		a happy medium so to speak
 	
 	
 		uh that's
 		yeah i'd like to see them restrict just those like i said before those new automatic weapons but the rest of it i don't think they need anymore
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		okay so i guess we kind of we've solved that problem right
 	
 	
 		i don't know if we solved it but  it is a problem and it unfortunately uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm not real crazy about guns myself but being from hunting families i
 		tolerate them
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well that's
 	
 	
 		and i like i like them to learn their safety rules and that and and i think that is good that they have to have a uh now here at least
 		they have a hunter's safety course that the the young people have to take before they're allowed to hunt yes
 	
 	
 		have to take before they ah that's good that is
 	
 	
 		they they have to do that before they can get a license to hunt
 	
 	
 		yeah and any responsible person or any responsible hunter is going to is going to go through some kind of a a course like that um
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
