 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wow that's interesting interesting
 		well what all do you have to take into consideration when you design a kite
 	
 	
 		the ones i like are the ones that are simple and cheap
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i have one that i made from newspaper that uh
 		you can't get much cheaper than old newspaper
 		but it doesn't have any sticks or anything of that sort
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it flies like a sled in other words
 	
 	
 		
 
 		are you uh have you made any money off your hobby
 	
 	
 		oh no no my hobbies are hobbies
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so what do you like to read when you read
 	
 	
 		i read uh both nonfiction and fiction
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		most of the name brand authors and so forth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh does that take up
 		do you uh
 		watch any TV or anything like that or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah everybody watches TV i suppose but i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i uh not married to it let's put it that way if i have a good book i would rather read it than watch TV
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good
 		that's cool
 		um
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		me i uh i play chess
 		i uh
 		lift weights
 		play basketball ride bikes that's my exercise part of my hobbies i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i read usually the Bible or some other type of Christian literature
 		um
 		let's see
 		
 
 		i like to play cards
 		uh
 		don't watch any TV though because we don't have a TV
 		but uh every once in a while i'll sneak over to some friend's house and we'll watch a ball game or something
 		uh
 		we're just we're pretty much new in Texas so we're just trying to get into the lifestyle like we'd like to go see a rodeo sometime and
 		and we my wife and i went to a one Ranger's game
 		and we'd like to go a few more times maybe see Nolan pitch one time
 	
 	
 		should have been out the other night right
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly that would have been the best were you watching that game
 	
 	
 		well we got to see the illegal broadcast that channel five had at the end of the game
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they were supposed to just show a quick flick and they it turned out that was the last batter that he was pitching to so they just stayed on the uh
 		network and i understand that the producers got themselves in a little trouble they'll probably have to pay a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		compensation of some sort for that
 	
 	
 		oh that's terrible
 		should showed a little bit of yeah
 	
 	
 		but we got to see it anyway so
 		they showed a little initiative
 	
 	
 		showed a little bit
 		oh yeah get your priorities in line see a little bit of history
 	
 	
 		right
 		where did you uh come to Texas from
 	
 	
 		from Indiana
 	
 	
 		from Indiana
 	
 	
 		yeah my wife and i both
 		went to Purdue and she got a job with Texas Instruments down here
 		so i kind of followed her down here and i'm looking for employment or schooling or something on those lines
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		Sherman is far enough away from Dallas to be uh away from most of the the blithe that associate is associated with Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they uh i work with Texas Instruments also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		actually i've been with
 		TI for thirty four years
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		in research
 		my wife originally came from Des Moines so she's from that turf up there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the Midwestern Corn Belt
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i was in the
 		Kokomo uh last year uh late on in the year uh out to the Delco plant Delco Electronics out that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		were you just out on loan or something or
 	
 	
 		they uh well we had we do a lot of uh
 		work with automotives that's lots of T i parts
 		on automotive uh things that don't have the TI bug on them
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we make uh
 		anything anything that's uh metal clad for example aluminum bumpers that are metal clad and all sorts we have we make  we make that in Massachusetts
 		the uh
 		a lot of the sensors that go there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when uh automatic chokes were common in automobiles well
 		we had a hundred percent capture of the American market we made all the automatic chokes for Ford Chrysler Chevrolet
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		all that so there's a lot of things like that that Texas Instruments makes
 		that even the employees don't know they make  for the most part
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no kidding i don't know that so the more a car becomes computerized the more TI becomes involved
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a lot of electronic stuff there as well but what i described was mainly uh associated with metals and sensors which is mainly what our Attleboro Massachusetts group does
 	
 	
 		huh
 		so how did you like Kokomo
 	
 	
 		oh i liked it fine
 	
 	
 		how long were you there
 	
 	
 		uh only two days we we were out visiting uh Delco to show them some of the uh computerized map things that we had that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well you said something about uh
 		the blithe of Dallas uh
 		do you live in Richardson
 	
 	
 		yeah well we we haven't
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		been contaminated yet shall i say with the blithe
 		but there's some older areas in Dallas and Oak Cliff that are pretty
 		you wouldn't want to be out at night let's put it that way in that area
 	
 	
 		yeah but that hasn't reached Richardson yet huh
 	
 	
 		no no thank goodness
 		and it's all the way across town it's on more on the south side than it is the north side anyway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i guess all the older cities have that
 		have that problem you say you play cards do you play bridge
 	
 	
 		oh i had a friend that taught me how to play bridge we we get all these transplanted people here in Sherman not too many i don't know any one that's from Sherman
 		now really uh a guy from New Mexico has been trying to teach us how to play bridge and we liked it we played a game called euchre which is
 	
 	
 		i'm familiar with it
 	
 	
 		you know euchre hey that's cool
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		yeah my uh i was in the uh service right after college the Korean war going on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my wife and i played uh
 		all sorts of card games that we got out of uh book of Hoyle of which euchre was one that we learned
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		pinochle
 		uh
 		flabbergash ever hear that i bet that's one you haven't heard of
 	
 	
 		i've heard of it but i've never played yeah i read read Hoyle too not the whole book but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		looked through some of the games
 		hey euchre's a
 		big Indiana game Indiana and Illinois and Ohio
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well in Texas of course the Texan game is with dominos playing forty two
 	
 	
 		with dominos
 	
 	
 		right
 		it's it's a bidding game also but not like bridge you only go around one time with dominos
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you probably haven't even heard of it but i'm i'm telling you that's a Texas game
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		that's a very uh very well known old timers
 		Texas game lots of people uh play that
 	
 	
 		so at least i got the scouting report
 	
 	
 		yeah in fact that used to be called Baptist bridge because the Baptist don't believe in playing cards so you could but it's okay to play dominos so you
 	
 	
 		so far
 		
 
 		
  
 	
 	
 		forty two is called Baptist bridge
 	
 	
 		that's funny
 		wow do you do you play cards a lot or
 	
 	
 		oh no i i like cribbage also that's a good game for two
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		play backgammon or anything like that
 	
 	
 		uh i haven't
 		really gotten serious about it like the resurgence i played it in uh teams but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		not until until it came back so to speak i haven't played that with the
 		the doubling bet and so forth
 	
 	
 		i figured a uh a computer man would be into chess
 	
 	
 		well i uh had no one around me when i was growing up i uh solved chess problems and have several chess
 		problem books you know mate and foremoves and that sort of thing which i enjoy but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i didn't have a uh anyone else around me uh when i was growing up that was all that interested in chess i know all the moves and i can follow the game and that sort of thing and enjoy watching
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		experts play
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i participated one time with a uh
 		grand master
 		we used to have a chess club at Texas Instruments and uh
 		we actually had a grand master in the area who came out
 		and played all of us  simultaneously you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he also played us uh blindfold chess one one one on uh one  and uh as the game was going along uh he says uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		mate in six and if you play chess you know six is a long way ahead  and uh we all looked at the board and couldn't figure out how he could possibly mate six and sure enough he mated in six just like he said he would
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow that's scary
 	
 	
 		but he played us uh on a round robin where he walks around the tables and plays everybody
 	
 	
 		how long ago was this
 	
 	
 		oh it's been several years ago like uh probably ten years
 	
 	
 		remember his name
 	
 	
 		no it's too long ago uh i really don't but he was he was something else we had one member who's really uh in the professional class if you will he used to go to the matches all the time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and his
 		let's see i've forgotten let's see the grand master and then right out of that's master what's the one that's just under master
 	
 	
 		expert
 	
 	
 		expert yeah he was expert
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh he gave him a run for his money when he he had to be playing all of us but
 		if he passed you uh twice uh you were out in other words if you hadn't moved when he went around so the more members he beat well the faster he got around and uh so Tony the
 	
 	
 		yeah
