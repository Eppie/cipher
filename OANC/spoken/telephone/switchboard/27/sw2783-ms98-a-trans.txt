 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you own a PC
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i do i own a um i own an i an X T clone it's a Samsung and uh with a Hyundai monitor monochrome monitor that i just keep at home for work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and acts as a terminal for me because i'm a graduate student and i log out of school from there
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		what are you taking in school
 	
 	
 		i'm a graduate student in psychology yeah i do uh language acquisition work
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but it's it's it's very helpful it's nice to have a machine at home that i can use locally for things like writing and so forth but i don't
 	
 	
 		oh it it's uh ideal for that
 	
 	
 		yeah and then i don't need printer or anything
 	
 	
 		word processing part is is extremely useful i think
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't need a printer or anything because i just sort of i can just call school and transfer everything over to school over the phone lines so how about you do you have um a machine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		an an P S E
 		and
 	
 	
 		okay i know it
 	
 	
 		i've
 		been used to working and this my first years but all of the work that i do is plus getting to know it a little bit better
 		they're powerful little rascals
 	
 	
 		yeah P S two's are general architecture
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		they're a little bit different though um we have two model seventies that we just bought last year and they um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there are some slight differences between those and other machines i'm finding oh i fell it's fine i actually don't i haven't actually noticed a major difference between a P S two and everything else actually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um you know in in in terms of performing faster or better or anything i'm not actually sure what the major advantage of a P S two over anything else is with the possible exception of the fact that it's got a mouse port built in the back
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd i've noticed uh there was some scattered at work and i notice the uh
 		through put is much faster on mine than than those but i think it's just because of the the lower level in expectation out of them that the processing speed is much faster
 		on uh the same canned programs
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think so um it's it's although although it's funny because i just i just had a discussion on break on one of our machines because it's just too slow
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we have a decent
 		somehow it slipped by us that we had bought one with two meg and of of memory of of RAM and one with only one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we're running this new version of Lotus i don't know if you've ever seen this or not you know
 	
 	
 		or performed to uh
 		eighty percent expectation anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true actually i um i found that this particular version three of Lotus one two three actually i think performs maybe even in the high ninety per cent of what i'm expecting at this point i am
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's it's because i'm new enough at it yet that i haven't figured everything out
 	
 	
 		what was your first exposure to the computer
 	
 	
 		my first exposure was
 		i guess when i was an undergraduate um a couple of years ago we had
 		they they inundated us with Macintoshes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they brought a bunch of Macs into uh there must have been some sort of program and they brought Macintoshes in for us to
 		for the school to do you know for all the kids in the school to do word processing on and
 	
 	
 		right
 		is there an undergraduate requirement on them
 	
 	
 		no there there never was an undergraduate requirement it just everyone really everyone took to them very quickly because there were a number of them available and
 	
 	
 		what about all the majors are there any such as business or uh or other
 		undergraduate majors do they require it of any of them
 	
 	
 		uh i'm not sure they must have they didn't in my case i was a psych major and they didn't i know that here they're required of some of of um where i am now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they require it of of actually a number of different uh majors
 		you know um some psychologists people psychology can take that in lieu of other courses and people in business have to uh i think are supposed and people in cognitive science definitely have to
 	
 	
 		well actually it's expanded your field too because the psychology of of man working with machine is  is a whole new element that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i i actually um you said you said you work on mainframes a lot that's a lot of what i do is on a a Sun i don't know if you work on Suns at all um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so Sun Microsystem machine which is another mainframe in a type of a mainframe we do lots of
 		um sort of brain you know neural network modeling
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		on on on a on a lot of mainframe machines so yeah this is been a lot of expanding and having to be able to have things at home and and to study the interaction too has been wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah it's interesting i think uh i've i've worked with computers since nineteen sixty
 		sixty
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm an old man
 	
 	
 		well no i mean wow they must have been very different back then
 	
 	
 		no they were the IBM six fifty took up a whole room as a vacuum tube uh machine
 		and it was binary quinary um base five
 	
 	
 		uh uh wow why base five
 	
 	
 		i have no idea  i didn't never did learn why but it was a base five
 		which is very interesting
 	
 	
 		God so you've really watched the whole the whole field grow up
 	
 	
 		oh it's been amazing it really has been
 	
 	
 		i mean the the the notion of personal computer back then meant you had to have your own living room
 	
 	
 		oh i know it i know it and it's almost like talking about the checkless society and and all of that and you know there was talk
 		in fact my brother uh was with IBM from nineteen fifty four until about three years ago so we really had a family history of talking about
 		development of uh of equipment
 	
 	
 		wow so this is the perfect topic for you
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and
 		i do i do some programming of my own too using Cobol rather than any of the newer languages
 		it's just one that i've known for a long time and still use it even on this
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		PS two
 		so i have
 		to learn a tolerance with canned programs because i'm so used to being able to do exactly what i want to do rather than having to
 		work around or go through two or three different steps to get to the the final one but i am amazed at the power
 		and uh ability of these small units that sit on a table or desk
 	
 	
 		well how do they compare with like um you know the the big um the big you know the ones that that took up a whole room in the sixties i mean how would you you know power wise was that less well actually less powerful
 	
 	
 		oh it it was almost
 		well
 		it's hard to describe
 		but it's almost like uh an abacus versus an electronic electronic calculator you know you
 	
 	
 		oh God really
 	
 	
 		you go
 	
 	
 		that that much and and and that much bigger too for the same analogy wow
 	
 	
 		oh yeah but i mean the speed
 		using punch cards and
 		for your information Ken this first uh first computer had one had two accumulators
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and one focal point that you had to channel everything into it was called a distributor and you moved it from memory
 		you had to know exactly where in memory it was there was no relative memory
 	
 	
 		oh God okay
 	
 	
 		and you had to know exactly in memory where it was move it to the distributor
 		put it into one of the accumulators and add it take it back out of the distributor and put it somewhere else so it it was as basic as you can get
 		and uh of course the speed
 		of processing
 		was very very slow but compared to anything then it was very very fast
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so it everything is relative
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		twenty twenty years from now we'll we'll call up again and say what do you think of the new uh thought computers
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		right and they'll and they'll say  imagine those big clunkers
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		of big laptop computers way back one
 	
 	
 		yeah but i think they're they're excellent tools for people to learn how to use and i'd like to see them in grade schools
 		right now i think they are in fact
 	
 	
 		does it
 		yeah there's there's
 	
 	
 		the computer system uh instruction
 	
 	
 		going to say there's a big move for that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my uh my my sister-in-law is a principal of a school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she just switched but before she was in a um a in a in a different school and she wrote a grant with i think it was Apple or IBM one of the two
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm pretty sure it was Apple actually to uh to get a whole bunchy of you know PCs into or PC type machines into the school for the kids to use and and it just
 		according to her it's just a wonderful thing kids go in and are able to work at their own pace and you know computers aren't impatient
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they'll sit there and wait forever if the kid doesn't want to answer for awhile or
 		it'll um it'll you know the kids for those kids who really have a problem working with faster than the class or slower than the class it lets them go what she's finding now is that in evenings the parents will come in and do it too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 		but it has a lot of home uses too i've i've not i don't have mine hooked up to anything uh
 		you know it's just a stand alone but
 		the abilities in the future will be networking throughout uh automatic built-in telephone
