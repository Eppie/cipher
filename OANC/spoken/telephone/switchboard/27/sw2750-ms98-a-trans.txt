 
     		
 	
 		all right well tell me all about your reunion planning
 	
 	
 		well we uh uh this will be uh uh the reunion for not my grandfather but my great grandfather and then my great and then my grandfathers so it's a couple of generations
 		um and these were pioneers who came across the plains
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh the families were are quite large and so we've had we spent a lot of time trying to gather up
 		uh names and addresses of all the tons of people that are involved
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so it takes a lot of time and planning
 		um good activity the what
 	
 	
 		are you going to do it over a weekend
 		are you going to do it over a weekend or
 	
 	
 		well interesting enough we're going to we're going to do it over an eight day period
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh they will not everyone won't be there for the whole time but the families can come in during that eight day time and kind of meet on the on the living family level
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		like i will come there kind of early and my brothers and sisters and their families will come so that we can get acquainted and then
 		uh it goes back the the generation before will join us and they may meet kind of individually in this camping area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then uh toward the end of the week there will be two specific days when we honor these two uh
 		uh groups my the grandfathers and the great grandfathers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh so it's kind of once more combining the whole group again
 		but uh it's it's it's uh it requires a lot of uh logistics for food for the people who will have to meet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a lot of uh arranging for activities
 	
 	
 		what are some of the activities
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well uh course you want to do some kinds of things that which will help them to get to know the ancestor that you're honoring
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but besides that if you have a lot of children and and different ages you need to try to find things
 		that uh that they will just have like to do together so that the next time somebody says reunion they won't run like
 		the four winds
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so it has to be pretty fun too i think uh we're we're going uh going to Utah to uh uh place near Park City
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh and it's a a pretty good size area where there'll be hiking and and then there will be uh
 		oh just uh general kinds of things like uh swimming and whatever during the uh in the area roundabout which they will do during the days when they want to
 		when they're not uh uh rehearsing or whatever for a part of the the play and then we'll kind of get together and and uh work out some small
 		oh vignettes or or uh acts or things like that Musical numbers
 		and the fact that we're together early during the week will help us to get together to prepare those things for the for the programs at the end of the week
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it it we're real excited about it now always before we have only had my grandfather's family and uh
 		we only did it for one day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh the last time we doing we were doing it every two years and we decided last time we would wait a third year because it came across so often that it was kind of hard to get there and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some people come from Back East and course i come from Texas so there's some of us come from quite a ways
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and so we we had a little longer and decided to try to hold it
 		uh in a situation that was a little longer like a camping situation something that wasn't too expensive but
 		uh could be more of a vacation situation for families to come and participate in while getting to know their ancestors and relatives
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh so that maybe they'd be attracted more to bring their families
 		now i've never gotten all my family to come before but this year i have uh several married daughters and and sons whose families are coming en masse so it it it looks to be a lot more interesting activity
 	
 	
 		this is what how did you pick uh
 		the place in Utah is it central location or
 	
 	
 		well uh the ancestors came from there
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh and we we were holding them there because there were some living ancestors up until
 		uh fairly recently at this point in that generation that we're honoring
 		there's only well my mother is ninety three and she won't go this year because it's just too hard on her
 		but uh and there's one other wife but all of the all of the children are now gone they they've passed away in the meantime
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so uh at that point we were going for that reason we were going there
 		but it just there just more of them there still than there are other places the rest of us are kind of strung around some but we're but you know if you if you're talking about convenient for the biggest majority it still is there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		also we had a we had a a the member who was in charge of it in general this time had some access to this park which was a big factor
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		whether we'll be able to do it there again but there are other kind of arrangements like in in uh
 		in some of the areas in Colorado you know where they ski in the winter time you can make some pretty good arrangements for uh for group uh activities and things like that
 	
 	
 		how
 	
 	
 		so we might do something like that also sometimes universities will will rent out uh areas for doing things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay how long in advance did you set the date
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		well we knew generally the time of year uh that we wanted to do it in three years ago but we could not set the date until the first of January this year because this park where they have it
 		uh they allow people in the vicinity to make their arrangements ahead of time and so we kind of had to take what was left
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so we we feel pretty fortunate to have gotten in at all but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i think you need to plan on you need to be sure and plan uh at least a year ahead of time or you're going to lose people
 		you know they have to plan their vacations that far ahead a little bit
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if not exactly at least know generally what they're going to do
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of important to to know quite a while ahead of time
 		uh the last time we had one uh i was in charge of it and my goal was to write a history of my
 		of my father and his  brothers and sisters
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there was a history of his father and mother but there was no history on them so i spent the two years before that compiling and and writing the history and then we gave it out at that
 		this year we're not we're we're combining it in the and the parents before and so we're going to do some um
 		uh acting out of of these groups and try to help them get better acquainted and mostly it's a different kind of thing so we're we're just kind of playing it by ear and seeing how it goes i think
 	
 	
 		wow sounds like you guys are uh your family's really into family
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah we're kind of like we kind of uh well we like each other and we liked our families and so we figure they the little kids ought to get to know each other and
 		and we are scattered enough there i have several children who live here but i also have children in in uh Nevada and Arizona
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's it's really neat to be able to get acquainted get around with them you know
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and  you're younger
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you have any family at all
 	
 	
 		uh well i'm married and uh my wife is from a large family
 		but my family my mother's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		living and she has
 		one brother that has no children that's living and my deceased father has one sister that has one child with and no other children so i have like four relatives
 	
 	
 		not very many huh do you do you enjoy your do you enjoy your your wife's large family though
 	
 	
 		not very many no
 		it too it's it was a large transition let me tell you because they had to meet one person they only had to meet me and i had to probably meet twenty five or thirty people
 	
 	
 		was it is it
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so getting names and faces and jobs and where they live and everything straight was a quite a task uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i still kind of balk at it because they're really into family too and like
 	
 	
 		you don't feel quite involved huh
 	
 	
 		well they try to involve me and if i allow myself to be involved you know i'll fit into the picture but uh they uh they make a big deal out of everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well you have to try it you'll like it
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i guess so uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it really is quite a lot of fun and uh um uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i'm just not used to it because our family has a reunion about once ever two years and and it's about a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know ten people show up so no one there's my age so i just kind of sit there and hang out but uh Carla has a lot of cousins
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that are our age and you know so we get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		cousins get really get really close sometimes almost closer than brothers and sisters sometimes
 	
 	
 		it's yeah it seems that happened with their family
 	
 	
 		especially
 		right especially if they live fairly close together so they get a chance to see each other
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's kind of special
 	
 	
 		yeah there family was pretty well centralized everyone kind of stayed around the the uh the grandparents
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for at least for a while at least while they were growing up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now they've kind of moved out a little bit but not too much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
