 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so um you said you don't have kids but um you're interested in the topic
 	
 	
 		well yeah and um actually i'm very interested we are my husband and i are thinking very soon um about having children and i think that i am just um
 		a little bit
 		uh brainwashed or whatever by just thinking that kids are so wonderful and cute and i can't wait to have one and i don't see the real responsibility of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and an actually how dramatically
 		your life can change when you do have children
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		do you have kids
 	
 	
 		yes yes i have one son who's now uh eighteen and he's a sophomore in college
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and it it does but i was very lucky in that i was um teaching at a university and so basically and lived within walking distance
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i was able when he was little just to um leave him with a neighbor in uh one of these carry cots
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then go up and teach a class and come back
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		because i could do my work at home and my my students who were working on their master's degrees and stuff would come to my house and i would meet with them there
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it was really ideal and then later on um when he was gee maybe two and three i actually took him then i changed to a different school but it was still within walking distance
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		and um he spent a lot of time in my office because i was uh department chairman
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um you know really didn't interfere because all his life he had sort of been used to there were quiet times
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		and so and that worked out great
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful how is it now i imagine you said he's a sophomore
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so this is is he living at home
 	
 	
 		yes he's commuting it's um about
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		gee he commutes forty five minutes a each way but he has to allow an hour and a half going to school because it's too too chancy for him to miss classes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		but
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and so actually we don't i mean we still spend a lot of time together in the sense that we are always together for dinner and and
 		um then you know he's in the house studying in the evening
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		and he also works and so um he usually calls me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		at when he gets home from school at noon i mean not not checking in but more gee you know missed you you know what with this is what's new type of thing and i think we have a very good relationship from that standpoint but i think it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		unusual and i think part of it is that that we were abroad for a good part of the time
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		until till um six years ago
 	
 	
 		where what part of Europe
 	
 	
 		well i was actually in the Middle East
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		oh how nice was he raised bilingual as a bilingual was he bilingual yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		bilingual yes yeah actually um
 		he he was more in a sense raised trilingual in that i spoke Spanish to him when he was a baby
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and then but he always answered in Arabic because he heard more Arabic than Spanish
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then when we first came to visit my mother he picked up English when he was two and a half
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and he had heard me talk English on the phone but you know he hadn't he really didn't use it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that is wonderful boy i i
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i am Arabic actually my background is um my my grandparents are from Syria
 	
 	
 		oh
 		where are you from
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i wish that my parents had taught me Arabic when i was younger it was really a sort of the taboo language
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when i was little um you know there was the whole and and there still is
 	
 	
 		cause you they were newly in this country
 	
 	
 		well my parents were born here my grandparents moved here um
 	
 	
 		ah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then had my parents shortly after they moved here
 	
 	
 		where were they where they what village
 	
 	
 		in Damascus
 	
 	
 		oh from Damascus okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum from Damascus all of them actually
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and um i just i think it's a real shame because now i don't have the patience and i don't have the ability you know at my age to start learning a foreign language
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but when you're a  kid you just pick it up so naturally
 	
 	
 		yeah but see there's a big big issue there because my my family spoke German at home so that we couldn't understand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and and my um nieces and nephews are not learning their mother's language
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that i think this is a a tendency in the States is because it's a melting pot so i think my son had the advantage of we were actually living outside the country
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so there was a reason for him to learn it
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really hard
 	
 	
 		yeah do you think that your being in academics um helped your son
 		he sounds like he is very responsible and um you know seems to be concerned about his studies
 	
 	
 		well i'm not so sure that it's the the academics as much as spending time with him
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i've been concerned in the States since i've been back with the number particularly in the Washington area where i live now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um  with a seeing how many kids come home to empty houses and like in our court we live in our townhouse court
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there's seven year olds that come home and they're locked out
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		and you know some of the neighbors sort of feel sorry sorry for them and and
 		you know would be very responsible if something happened but the parents aren't willing to to pay that person to sort of be in charge and and i think this is
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		i you know i've just seen so much of it here in this country that you wouldn't see in in certainly not in the Arab culture i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah oh no that for sure
 	
 	
 		people people are more important than things so
 	
 	
 		and then everyone wonders why why like you said that seven year old you know why two months from now he's on drugs or something
 	
 	
 		he's a terror well he's a terror he just you know climbs on cars walks around the court threatening people with sticks
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh jeez
 		oh well he has no discipline i mean no one is there to tell him what's right and what's wrong
 	
 	
 		yeah it
 		right now would you continue do you work now
 	
 	
 		yes i do i work full time and my husband actually is going for his PhD and uh would like to teach
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and be a professor um hopefully somewhere in the south i i i'm from
 		Boston and i i'm fed up with the cold weather really between Boston and Rochester
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um ideally i would um i want to have a child and i'd like to be able to be home for a year
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i really just selfishly don't want to miss that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um you know my husband's schedule hopefully will be flexible um
 		in that he could do a lot of his work at home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i'm not sure i i still want to work i think that's very important
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to keep that up and i don't want to um you know i don't want to go several years without working outside the house
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um
 		but i think that him being um a little bit more flexible with his schedule will really help us out a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that that's nice thing about teaching
 	
 	
 		right right that you he'll be able to spend more time which is so important
 	
 	
 		right and i imagine that obviously your summers were a lot lighter as far as work load
 	
 	
 		right actually we traveled extensively because i was doing archeology and so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		you know he was always able to come with me on all my travels because a lot of the places i went by car of course
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		and i mean you know i was living in the middle of it and i took every advantage and and you know he doesn't dislike travel now he might not like it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know he might not feel compelled to travel because he has seen a lot but he's very comfortable traveling
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so
 	
 	
 		well he has done more and seen more than most people do in a lifetime it sounds like that's wonderful and it it sounds like he really appreciates it too
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		right you know that that remains to be seen but yes i think so i think so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		does he have a girlfriend  oh
 	
 	
 		no
 		no and and and i find that interesting because he's been two years ahead in the schools here
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and so he always you know was treated like little brother when the band needed transportation they'd say oh he can't drive so
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		you know when he's a senior he can drive some of the the younger kids around type of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he didn't he didn't get his license i mean he was just sixteen when he graduated from high school so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know he he has friends but he doesn't have any you know he hasn't really gotten into the social thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and  he's i think that's all right he's going to it looks like finish his degree first before he gets too involved
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum well that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it's it's i would love when i was little i had friends and they had enormous families and i would love to have a large family it seems so expensive though
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to think about raising a child besides just the the essentials you know clothes and food and this and that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i really feel like there's this whole um you know you have to keep up with the Jones or whatever they say and uh you know it just seem like when i you know watch
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		but you don't have to keep up i mean kids appreciate it more if you don't
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i think if if things are special and are for them they see that their kids are being bought
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that their friends are being bought by their parents
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i hope so i mean i look at these toys on TV and i just think oh my God they didn't have those when i was little
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh and they don't need them and they don't even appreciate them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean that's my feeling i think you know from what i see a lot of people just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's a token you know you don't have me so you have all these material things
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah that's true
 		well it's interesting well i don't know i think i'm ready for it a couple of years we got married a couple of years ago and i thought oh my God i'll never be ready for a kid
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i i definitely think i am now
 	
 	
 		oh very good and it sounds like you have good values and
 	
 	
 		yeah
