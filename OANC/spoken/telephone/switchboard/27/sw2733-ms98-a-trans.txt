 
     		
 	
 		what's uh
 	
 	
 		well what what kind of cars do you drive do you usually drive
 	
 	
 		right now we i've got a uh four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness well we're we're we're sort of sort of a General Motors family i guess that's the way we were raised
 		and uh uh we were overseas for TI for a number of years and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family
 	
 	
 		oh goodness
 	
 	
 		yeah  and four cars and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental at at least two of them we bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		uh for you know they each had twenty one thousand miles or something like that and turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh then we've got an eighty six Chevy Spectrum that we bought new my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we've got a eighty four Toyota that we bought used so we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers it's like musical chairs
 	
 	
 		i bet i bet
 	
 	
 		yeah one short  and uh but you know it's interesting the two even though my dad uh was a Chevrolet man forever and ever ever and we were in the retail milk business and he had all Chevrolet milk trucks and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and we bought automobiles and all that and it was almost like and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a but a Chevrolet it'd be like going and spitting on his grave  but uh
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and we got older and got away and then we thought well you know you still could buy General Motors products and it was probably not that bad but uh we lived in Malaysia for TI in nineteen uh eighty one two three and four
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and of course you don't buy General Motors products over there but we bought a Volvo and i have never had a car that i've loved more i just can't afford them here uh but i i just loved that car
 	
 	
 		no
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh we bought a uh we lived in the Philippines for TI in eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and we bought a uh Ford Telstar which is somewhat similar to the Taurus it's sold in the in uh the Far Eastern countries Far East countries more
 	
 	
 		um-hum i
 	
 	
 		then here but we really liked that and have you had experience with cars other than the ones you've had
 	
 	
 		well yeah we had uh we had these are the first cars that my husband and i have ever purchased ourselves the others were hand-me-downs through the families
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and those were always GM cars  uh Buicks and Chevrolets and um we were real happy with them  but all the ones that we ever had were the you know eight cylinder
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah the big the big yeah
 	
 	
 		really rugged GM cars
 		and all we had heard was was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars and we both drive  well forty five miles round trip every day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		and so we wanted a smaller car when we got ready to buy we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage  and quite frankly we were afraid of the of the GM small cars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know as far as durability so we kind of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		when when we had our larger cars we didn't mind um
 		keeping them up you know doing the maintenance and everything on them  as long as we didn't have to do it very often
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them  all of them you know  it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it seems that something goes every month
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		and i'm afraid we're gonna be in that in another year with all of ours you know we got three eighty sixes and an eighty four and we'll probably be there with all of them you know it's the same thing you know i don't know whether you uh classify the Skylark and the Calais as small i guess they're intermediates
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but uh we went on a family trip to Massachusetts and there were five of us and uh five five of us never go anywhere together here
 		everybody everybody's heading off in their own direction  and i rented a Buick Le Sabre
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's the first big car i had since i had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy six to eighty  and it made all the i i had forgotten what driving a big car was like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's like a yacht
 	
 	
 		it was just nice it floated
 	
 	
 		yeah what we had we sold our our we we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a great car it just we ran ran the wheels right off of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah and
 		and uh you know i've read i'm in the quality business at TI i'm a quality manager and we're we're uh we deal we sell i'm in the semiconductor group and we sell to uh Ford Chrysler and GM uh GM Delco
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there is a amazing i am just uh really impressed with the with the quality consciousness that these those these companies have put into their procurement and it's  uh it's come about as a result of the competition from the Japanese
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh uh i and you know we used to think Ford products were tinny i mean i was growing up
 		i was taught that when i was growing up you know that that that real people bought General Motors products and you know and peons bought Ford products but just with the quality requirements
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants and they're really
 		uh uh stressing this partnerships in quality and you know GM and Chrysler are doing that but i really think Ford's got a leadership leadership position in this right now and i think it's showing up in their automobiles their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh uh we went to uh Austin a while back to a basketball tournament and we were gonna be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down we'd rent
 		one and we went up to the local Budget and we were gonna get a Olds Eighty Eight or something he said i'll tell you what for a dollar a day more i'll give you a Lincoln Towncar
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and we drove that down and i hated to turn that back in when we got back we had that for three days and i absolutely loved except i wouldn't wanna have to park it in tight places all the time
 	
 	
 		i bet
 		no i wouldn't wanna have to pay for the gas either
 	
 	
 		uh but i absolutely loved that automobile  and you know it wasn't that i'd driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon but on the trip down and back i filled up
 		both coming and going so i knew what i actually got on the trip and it was about twenty four miles a gallon
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it let it float
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it was pretty nice are you are you are you planning on getting any additional or other cars
 	
 	
 		it's a nice car
 		no time soon um we're
 		our our kids we won't have anymore licensed drivers for about thirteen years  yes  so we um so we don't plan on purchasing anymore anytime soon both of our cars are getting
 	
 	
 		hm oh yeah yours is small
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh around sixty thousand miles on them we drive a lot
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah you probably got another another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we've got probably we'll get something in the next couple years my son will graduate from high school this year and and he's gonna go to Richland College one year behind us
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's right you know in fact our house is adjacent adjacent to the Richland property he wants to go to Texas Tech and he's probably gonna have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order  but uh the next year when he goes out to Tech he wants a pickup
 	
 	
 		a pickup
 	
 	
 		and i want a pickup i may get one and not let him have it but we have been looking at these red Chevrolet they they're very popular around here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		these uh red uh red Chevy pickups and uh we'll probably do something like that uh uh incidentally uh
 		uh i don't know uh the uh the credit union has got a deal now where you decide what you want and you call this number  and uh they go negotiate the price for you
 		and and or or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh my boss just bought a Chevy pickup and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh uh you know you you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and and tell him what you want and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealer's place
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i'm gonna try that the next time i buy one
 	
 	
 		i think that'd be a good idea
 	
 	
 		and and so you know i can go around and comparison shop and see if i can get a better negotiation on my own but  once uh one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating
 	
 	
 		yeah i've we've
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've we've kind of been the types that will say this is what we intend to spend this is the car we want will you sell me this car for that price
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and for that price
 	
 	
 		and and we've had we with our when we bought our Subaru the guy was like you can't do this to me and we were just like okay fine we we won't then you know and he's like no no no but
 	
 	
 		we'll go somewhere else yeah
 		yeah and uh and i i think that's probably the way you got to do it when when i was young
 		i went in and bought a uh or made a deal on a sixty this is nineteen sixty i'd first come to Texas and made a deal on a sixty red Impala convertible
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that i just loved and this guy gave me this deal you know i told how much i wanted to pay  and for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss and then i'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we would go ahead and buy uh uh if he could get this rate i promised to buy and i left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted i i was only twenty five years old or something  and i i left there and i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i uh i'd never done this before because i'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from  and uh uh so
 		i i got back and a salesman that lived in the apartment i did asked me uh uh if he'd heard i was gonna get a car and asked me what i paid for it he said well hey uh before you go buying anything he says call this friend of mine at Will's Point
 		it was a guy that owned a Chevrolet dealership up there  and i called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and just driving fifty miles out of town it was a difference and i mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty five hundred is all we paid for cars in those days  and uh
 	
 	
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		uh so i called back the guy in Dallas and i told him that i'd left him a check for tax title and license and everything  and i said i wanna cancel my order and and don't try to cash the check because i'm gonna i've stopped payment on it already
 		and he says oh somebody's taking he said what did you get a deal for Bill and i told him he says somebody's taking you for a ride and i said no somebody took me for a ride
 		last Saturday and uh uh and i i find that uh and for the longest time then i drove up to Will's Point and the and the and the fellow died since then and and some of his relatives taken over the business and but and since then i hadn't really
 	
 	
 		that's right
