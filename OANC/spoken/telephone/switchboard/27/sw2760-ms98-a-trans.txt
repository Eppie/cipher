 
     		
 	
 		all righty
 		okay have you recently had to return anything
 	
 	
 		yes i have
 	
 	
 		okay tell me about it
 	
 	
 		well i have a VCR and i've had to return it a couple of times because of the same part failure
 		and uh
 		it's still not getting a real good picture
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and after
 		about three hundred dollars i think it's going to be worth it just to go ahead and get a new machine
 	
 	
 		you mean it the warranty wasn't on it or
 	
 	
 		so
 		well i didn't get the extended warranty it was out of warranty just barely so uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		so how about you
 	
 	
 		well i haven't had to return anything recently but i you know i feel  i'm going to i'm on a portable phone i'm going to go closer to the station  here uh
 		i i feel like things are are not made as well as they used to be i um just cause you for instance clothing i you know i have two children and um
 		we we say they they like nice clothing and i spend a lot of money on it and it just doesn't last and i mean i'm very careful to follow the washing instructions and do exactly
 		what it says and it still still it they still wear out very quickly uh i find things that are sewn very poorly uh they they come come unhemmed or unstitched so easily
 	
 	
 		well i will agree with that we've had some run ins especially with buttons as soon as you get them home the buttons fall off after the first time and uh the threads on the inside of the garments
 	
 	
 		right right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		seem like they're just they don't cut threads off they're just a wads of threads and stitching does come undone you know fairly soon and then the prices you pay for them are ridiculous
 	
 	
 		they never cut him off
 		oh i know it's really it's silly and and my i have teenagers and they
 		they think they want a certain brand or a certain item well
 		when you buy a brand name that's popular you're paying for the brand name and
 	
 	
 		not only that but they're no better than a lot of the the the
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		non name brand stuff so
 	
 	
 		exactly that's what i you know i'm saying that the you know if i'm paying for the name and i'm paying that much money it'd better be
 		a quality product now i do there's there are some that i think are a little bit better
 		and i and i've been real pleased with them and my kids are have enjoyed wearing them and they've lasted until they've outgrown them
 		but uh the majority of things um don't last and they're just very inferior
 		and you know i try i try to look at the labels and i try i try to
 		to buy things that are made in the USA because i think that's important and yet i find a lot of the the
 		the homemade goods are are inferior and also with cars i um
 		i i bought a new car last summer and i shopped around for a long time i mean we went to a lot of different dealers and i wanted to buy an American car because i had had a Toyota and i really liked it but i felt like
 		i needed to buy buy something that was American made because i felt i owed that well i just could not find an American made car that i felt
 		was worthy of the price they wanted and um i ended up buying another
 		i ended up buying a Nissan and i love it
 	
 	
 		well  the Americans just haven't gotten the message yet that's one thing because i'm i'm the same way we i do own an American
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		car well a truck but uh in trucks i think you're pretty safe but in cars i've not had an American car that i've been really pleased with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		one for gas mileage and two uh the reliability things falling off the inside uh you know frequent tune-ups every foreign car i've ever made i mean that i've ever bought i've i've loved it
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		uh-huh
 		yeah and they're so much more solid they sound better when you're in them they feel you feel like you're
 		in a car and not rattling around in something i you know i just  i just am real pleased with the Nissan i had and i had a
 		Subaru before the Toyota and i loved that it was just the best car i've ever had in fact i wanted to buy another another one but i
 		really it really what didn't have what i wanted they didn't have the the type of family car i wanted but that car i had for five years and
 		i never had one thing go wrong with it and it um
 		only thing i had to have replaced was the clutch and i had to do that twice because it was my fault because i ride it all the time and uh so you know it wore out
 	
 	
 		well clutches are something that you really can't judge i mean they they some go out faster than others and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that's those kind of items like that wear items there's no way you can judge
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh like brakes uh i we have a a Volvo and the brakes go out on it on about every fifteen thousand miles
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		it's just inherent for that car but the the car is super
 	
 	
 		oh i know i've heard great things
 	
 	
 		i'd rather put the brakes on it and uh and have the the reliability in the car itself but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yes and it's a safe car too it's a good made car
 	
 	
 		for the most part it's been a good car we've had it for six years now
 	
 	
 		oh that's great well that the the Subaru i had when i sold it it still had the tires
 		the factory tires on it and the factory battery one i mean that's how good it was i never had one trouble with the battery and which is amazing in five years i didn't have to get a new one and it worked perfectly
 		and it was amazing the tires were um excellent and uh you know when i sold it it didn't have that many it was low mileage i didn't think i had like thirty seven thousand miles on it which is
 		nowadays low but uh i got a good price on it it's got good resale value and it was really a good car
 		and you know it it kind of is frightening i think that you're right American uh manufacturers still haven't got the the idea that that quality is important and that
 	
 	
 		well if you can see the transition what i'm beginning to see is that the Japanese cars and and even just foreign cars in as a whole are beginning to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		get larger but they're able to keep the gas mileage and the reliability whereas the US are beginning to scale down but the gas mileage doesn't improve drastically
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		you're right you're right
 	
 	
 		and that right there ought to tell them something
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i know we have the technology but i think it's the the glut of the oil companies and and uh big business and the government
 	
 	
 		um-hum yes
 	
 	
 		in trying to control things that they shouldn't control and
 		uh they're not controlling the things they should control
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		so i think there's a there's a lot of things there to be said and
 		uh i will continue to buy
 		foreign cars if that's the most reliable product especially when i'm paying for it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right because you
 	
 	
 		and i and i hate to have that attitude but i do
 	
 	
 		well the thing is when you have to take your car in continually because it's not working and pay that much money in repair
 		price bills it's ridiculous i i had a Plymouth that was just the worst car in the world and i mean everything that could go wrong with it went wrong with it i had it in to the dealership more than i had it out it was terrible and i got rid of it as fast as i could it was the most
 		it was a lemon is what it was and uh you know i will never buy a Plymouth again simply because of that
 	
 	
 		oh i know i'm the same way with GM i won't buy a GM car
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah i like Ford trucks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then i like the foreign cars especially Honda i've had a Honda
 	
 	
 		oh i've heard good things about a Honda
 	
 	
 		that i liked and uh i mean it was super car
 	
 	
 		yeah my niece has one and she loves it too yeah
 	
 	
 		so i think you know
 	
 	
 		but you really liked your Ford truck huh
 	
 	
 		well it's been a good truck so far it's only got a forty two thousand miles on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so far so good
 		don't know what's going to happen when it gets another twenty or thirty thousand miles on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'm looking for a used truck for my son and it's it's really been hard because we i we just don't have that much money to spend
 		to spend he just turned sixteen uh you know i don't i want to get an inexpensive truck a small one that um you know i only have to pay a couple of thousand or you know three thousand
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		well trucks trucks keep they hold their value
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		pretty much and and even used trucks are pretty expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah they are we did find a couple but um
 		you know they just i wasn't real sure about them and uh so we we kind of passed them up um this one guy is not
 		is trying to make up my his mind whether he wants to sell his it's a Mitsubishi and it's an eighty five and he wants to sell it for about two thousand
 		but uh he's not sure he wants to give it up and start car payments again so we're kind of waiting for him to make that decision but
 	
 	
 		oh i can't i can certainly understand that i don't want any car payments either in fact when mine's paid off and
 	
 	
 		you know
 		oh
 	
 	
 		our other one's paid off uh i don't want to get another car until they just both fall apart
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they're car payments are outrageous now
 	
 	
 		well it's it's just anymore they don't benefit you uh from the income tax stand point
 	
 	
 		oh that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh of course we just can't afford to trade cars like that so
 	
 	
 		hum-um hum-um
 	
 	
 		we're just going to make it go as far as it can and then when we're forced to get one we will
 	
 	
 		well that's why it's important to find a car that you don't have to keep taking in for repairs because if you're gonna keep it a long time
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		are you i mean shoot you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on repairs
 	
 	
 		which can be easily done these days
 	
 	
 		yes easily easily and you know that another thing about
 		not only about uh you know products but
 		services  you're not real sure of anymore you you take a car in and you think it's fixed or and and how do you know if they really even fixed it and and sometimes i wonder you know and it's kind of scary
 		you just you're not sure
 	
 	
 		where where are you from
 	
 	
 		i'm from i'm originally from Ohio
 	
 	
 		Ohio and where are you now
 	
 	
 		i'm in Texas
 	
 	
 		you're in Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		i was going to say because uh i was going to say if you're up in the in the northern countries the salt would be a big factor on i didn't know how much how they take care of the warranty items when it comes down to corrosion and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah it's uh bad up there but i'm i've been in Texas like thirteen years now so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what are what part of Texas are you from
 	
 	
 		uh from Coppell
 	
 	
 		Coppell i'm from Plano
 	
 	
 		Plano
 	
 	
 		we're not yeah we're not too far away
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		fact my brother lives in Plano
 	
 	
 		is that right oh well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but
 	
 	
 		i don't  have much more to say about things i i feel the same way that you do though i think it things are you know need to get better and i think you need we need to have somehow more of a trust in in US made goods and it's sad that we don't but uh
 	
 	
 		i would i would certainly like to And i hope that that before it's too late they do get the message
 		and i i don't know i think a lot of it has to do with uh
 		you know just the attitude of the
