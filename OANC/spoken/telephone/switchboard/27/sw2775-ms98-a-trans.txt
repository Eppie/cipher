 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay tell me about your home
 	
 	
 		well it's an older home it was made back in the early sixties it's a pier beam house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		got
 		three bedrooms one bath and that just makes me scream
 	
 	
 		that's pretty tough
 		what area do you live in
 	
 	
 		i live in Houston
 	
 	
 		oh okay i see is that pretty typical for your area
 	
 	
 		well for the neighborhood i'm in yeah this is one this is one of the more uh established neighborhoods
 	
 	
 		it is
 		uh-huh
 		that sounds really interesting i live in a suburb of Dallas
 		and um i live in the basic three bedroom two bath home so at least i have two bathrooms that's not so bad
 		but uh it's pretty typical for the area as well
 		um i've always been interested in older homes personally
 		so it's i think you can end up you can end up doing more with them it seems like
 		what is it what about uh yard space do you have lot of uh a big lot or anything like that
 	
 	
 		well the whole the whole lot i'm sitting on is roughly half an acre
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		well half about half of that about a quarter acre of that i've got a garden
 	
 	
 		hum-um oh that's nice
 		because i have just a like a very small you know those basic tract houses like that we have a very small yard and um i do have garden but it's it's extremely small
 		but uh it seems like though for your area that's that's sort of different in a big city like that
 		most houses i would think would be sort of like uh what we live in just a
 		you know a basic tract house
 	
 	
 		well in the um
 		newer neighborhoods
 		development communities that they've put together the houses are so close together if your neighbors having an argument you can hear it blow for blow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's exactly right that's the way we are we have uh one thing that we really do enjoy is we have a hot tub in the back so we have we have quite a few parties
 		and uh it seems like everyone that lives around us ends up
 		you know hearing every conversation that goes on outside you know with everyone so uh that's true that's one thing that i don't enjoy about it is the houses are too close together
 		but uh you know it's it's fine for now hopefully eventually we'll move into a larger home
 		the only thing that i don't like also is that the the rooms are so small
 		you know it's it's very difficult to arrange furniture and and things like that so are are the rooms in your house bigger since it's a a sixties home it seems like then that they built the rooms much larger is that true
 	
 	
 		and they've got better closet space than most of the new houses that i've seen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah that's really it that's a plus at least we do have uh like three walk-in closets here so that's
 		that's maybe not so so typical but uh
 	
 	
 		it helps a bunch
 	
 	
 		yeah it really does except when you you know have to fill them up and then you get those Visa bills in and
 		so anyway um anything else about the area about um
 		you know that it compare can you can compare your house to anything around there
 	
 	
 		most of the neighborhood i'm in is pretty typical this whole neighborhood was kind of built in between sixty and sixty five
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so it's just it's just
 	
 	
 		so everybody's got a usually a pretty good size yard i think i've got probably the biggest
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if not the biggest yard i've got
 		pretty close to it in the entire neighborhood
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's nice that is nice
 		but you know too the only bad thing about that is then you have to keep up you know you have
 	
 	
 		well that's
 	
 	
 		the yard to deal with and
 	
 	
 		i enjoy that though
 	
 	
 		do you
 		you must have more time than than i have i'm sitting out here right now we had this terrible rain and i'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten and  it seems like now that's that's
 		i almost wish i was in an apartment or something you know
 	
 	
 		praying for rain down here
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah
 		well um i don't know do we just terminate this or or do you have to talk for a a certain amount of time do you know
 	
 	
 		no we can  the after you go to
 		i think its five somewhere between five and ten minutes they'll get a little master recording on here that
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 		well can you tell me anything else about the house
 		are you working on it i mean do do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation
 	
 	
 		yeah this entire neighborhood everybody keeps the places up real nice
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's nice
 		yeah the the town that i came from is uh is a uh older town
 		and it's like the typical the typical homes there are like you know early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and i renovated a house
 		there and that was you know that was so much fun i mean there if you don't live in a house that's at least
 		seventy five to hundred years old you know you're just
 		you're just nobody practically and that was really it that was a good experience for me
 		you learn a lot of discipline and
 		and uh that was what considered typical for that area
 		so uh it it's it was quite a change for me to come to a house like this now that's just you know a very square little box and you know there's not there's not a whole lot you can do with it but uh
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		living in the city living in the city has some advantages but given the choice i'm getting out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 		oh really
 		well i had lived in a small town for you know this this town was like less than ten thousand people
 		and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas
 		and i you know i didn't move out of there until i was you know twenty seven and out that was just
 		you know so i i love the big city because you know i had lived in a rural area for for so long so i've enjoyed it
 		but uh it can get it can get kind of tough it is like a rat race sometimes
 	
 	
 		that's just something i'll never adapt to i don't
 		i don't want to be a part of the rat race i want to be
 		basically just kind of left alone if i want to if i want to sit around and mess mess with my garden i'll mess with my garden if i want to work in the flower beds fine
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		it sounds like you enjoy working outside as well i i really yeah i really do enjoy that i haven't planted anything yet or
 	
 	
 		very much
 	
 	
 		you know i usually have got flowers coming out the gazoo but i've i haven't done that yet i've had finals this week so uh
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		you know i'm just kind of been trying to
 		trying to uh stick in with that but uh since that's over with now maybe i can
 		i can get this yard in shape
 		do you do a lot of gardening
 	
 	
 		uh
 		landscaping more than the garden the gardening i've got my beans peas i've got some onions out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		tomatoes i'm not real sure what they're going to do this year
 	
 	
 		i never have much luck with tomatoes i do i do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the the uh bugs get on them so easily
 		and i have a real problem with anything pesticide like pesticides or anything like that so
 		the only thing that i use is soapy water you know spray the plants because they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them
 		but uh i don't have luck with that on tomato plant so i hate to spray them with anything um what do you do  do you have any tips you could give me
 	
 	
 		um my favorite one is putting on the um
 		tomato plant is to put uh seven dust
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time and
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true i've my dad is a farmer so you know i've heard him talk about that forever
 		i guess it works but um you have to really wash your vegetables after that
 		so it won't make you sick
 		let's see what else do you do to your house
 	
 	
 		well i've done some rewiring on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		eventually i'm gonna have if if we stay here i'm gonna have to rewire the entire house
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		do you plan on uh like adding any rooms or you have enough space you could probably do that
 		or is it
 	
 	
 		i've talked well i've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on
 	
 	
 		yeah  i would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms that's that's tough
 		that's really tough do you not like have a half bath
 	
 	
 		not even a half bath
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's that's rough the house that i used to live in had like one bath and a half
 		and that was even just with two people that was a pain
 	
 	
 		the only thing that saves it with the schedule i work and the schedule my wife works we're getting ready to go to work at different totally different times
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		so that it's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning trying to get ready
 	
 	
 		really that that could account for a lot of marital problems i think  you get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on and you're both fighting over the mirror
 	
 	
 		no
 		that's right it's it's not it does not make for a for a happy situation that's true well do you have any children
 	
 	
 		got one
 	
 	
 		one child and they enjoy they enjoy where they're living
 	
 	
 		we'll he's nine months old now
 	
 	
 		oh so he doesn't know right
 		i guess he's a big help out in your garden right
 	
 	
 		uh he he likes to dig around a little bit then his mother comes in and says how why did you let him play in the dirt like i said he was enjoying himself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		that's right it's healthy why not
 	
 	
 		as long as he wasn't eating the dirt i wasn't to worry about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		nah it won't hurt them i i was a big dirt eater supposedly when i was a child and i turned out okay so don't worry about it just let him enjoy himself
 		
 
 		so you think that you want to move away from the big city huh
 	
 	
 		well that's what i've always  i was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so you're just the opposite from me you want to go back to that huh
 	
 	
 		and then after you're getting married
 		move
 		ended up moving to Houston the Houston area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah so are you from Texas or you are
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so it's not you know that's that's true Houston in itself is a pretty tough place you
