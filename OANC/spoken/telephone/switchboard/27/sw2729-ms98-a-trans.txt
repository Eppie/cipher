 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay what kind of puppy you got
 	
 	
 		well uh i think she's mostly German Shepherd uh she was uh uh
 		a person lives across the street from me
 		uh brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep somebody somebody abandoned her and she's only about oh six between six and eight six to eight weeks old
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh uh i can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though she's almost i mean she's that this young and she's almost housebroken
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		i mean she actually asks to go out
 		and uh yeah i was
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		amazed
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality i don't know i can't imagine what uh
 		would have been wrong with this dog so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i i have a dog that God gave us too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah she just appeared
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband calls her street dog but we've had her now for about three years and i just you get so attached to them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		i had a uh last year i had another i had another German Shepherd now this one was purebred and uh
 		he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and
 		was just about on death's door but uh managed to get him to a veterinarian in time and uh and on huge doses of antibiotics and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		he actually got over it with huh seven hundred dollars in vet bills
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		um but he had actually was able to get him over that and then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy and uh he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a Cadillac
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		so i couldn't believe it that was that was really hard but
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		and
 		that was even harder for i was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street so they just felt absolutely awful
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh i bet
 	
 	
 		and i felt felt probably worse for them than than for me because oh gosh they the uh
 		this fellow's wife who was uh watching the dog probably she i think she loved that dog more than i did and uh
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		she was just really attached to it but uh it's it's unfortunate but now i've got another one so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah how long has it been since the first one
 	
 	
 		um see he it it was just over a year uh it was in March of last year
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		so um yeah it'd been didn't didn't have one for a whole year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i had i had a German Shepherd before this one and when she died it just it just
 		i absolutely destroyed me i mean i was just  you know i couldn't even talk about it for months and so i decided well that's it i'm not going to do this anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then God gave me this dog so
 	
 	
 		my dad's like that he uh he had a beagle that he loved and uh when that Beagle passed away uh he didn't want he wasn't going to have another dog there's no way no how and then uh the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he the Beagle died in i guess about October and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him uh or i  Humane Society and got uh got another one a stray and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing but
 	
 	
 		okay yeah well you just do you can't help it's like it's like a kid
 	
 	
 		mom went and
 		yeah
 		yeah it is
 		well hopefully this one here Cocoa will live a full life
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well when uh my my doggy uh that we have now uh she's she's mostly Golden Retriever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the vet called her uh a golden mix  like who knows you know but she's uh she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh and her nose is that pink
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know she doesn't have a brown nose and her eyes she's sort of unicolor you know eyes are the same color and everything so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i named her Rosebud
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh a friend of mine said she that she grew this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had uh a pet cow named Rosebud and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name said my cow lived seventeen years
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's not too bad  the Golden Retriever's are good dogs too they're kind of like get that
 		permanent smile to them
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		they're always always happy i don't think i've ever seen them
 		not look happy
 	
 	
 		and she's so easy going and so sociable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know she loves everybody little kids can just you know maul all over her and she just you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		this
 	
 	
 		thinks it's great
 	
 	
 		this this friend of mine has the well it's the same guy that was watching uh my German Shepherd when he got hit but uh went fishing with him on Friday
 		and took he's got a full a pure bred Golden Retriever
 		and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing and this they just they had a ball romping around and you know you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		getting in yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh this Golden Retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		well no actually he had no trouble at all he first jumped in and i he's he's just about a year old himself and never had really i don't think he'd swum before
 		but he jumped in in the the river
 	
 	
 		really
 		did puppy go to
 	
 	
 		well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the i was careful to keep her away from the
 	
 	
 		oh that's good yeah
 	
 	
 		the fast moving water because if she fell in then i'd of been had to go in after her
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now
 	
 	
 		ewe ewe
 	
 	
 		and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but uh
 		this dog Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he jumped in again and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon he loved it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Cocoa didn't think too much of it though she jumped in and then started screaming and uh made me pull her back out
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but she got over it
 		so
 	
 	
 		well the German Shepherd that i had before we we had a little pool
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh she was she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to to get in the pool on the first step she'd just get on the first step and lay down
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know in the summertime when it's really really hot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and she'd just lay there on that step and just you know cool off
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i live right across the street from a a big lake here um
 		it's on Oneida lake and i'm wondering if uh
 		if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year i mean i've got the yards all fenced in so she doesn't run loose but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she could go in sometime when if i'm watching her something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and she oh baths oh gee she hated baths worse than anything it was it was just really a fight to you know get her clean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have you seen uh Canine
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		the movie oh you've got to see it especially since you have a German it is so cute
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh an part of the the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's it's just hysterical
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		my my dog last German Shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too and that was the thing i couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake it wasn't like he didn't ah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		normally i mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet but if you wanted to get him wet forget it
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's how Cleo was you know she'd lay on her step
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that was that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet
 	
 	
 		right right
 		obstinate obstinate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but you really need to see that movie i i we we bought the movie and i don't i don't know how many times i've seen it and it came on TV the other night and i was watching it again and my husband heard me laughing and he said i can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 		i'll have to check it out i saw the the uh
 		previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good movie movie but uh
 	
 	
 		it is great
 	
 	
 		really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately but
 	
 	
 		yeah

 		but it's nice having a dog here uh the
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh no oh no what's the unrequired what's the word i'm looking for uh lots of affection
 	
 	
 		there's just

 		no conditional unconditional affection from the from the dog
 	
 	
 		that's it
 		really
