 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay um i have i have i purchased a gun um recently and um i wouldn't i i feel like that
 		the way i feel about it that uh you know it would be nice if you get could get rid of guns completely although i do like to shoot them for sport but i don't think you're going to be able to do that and to make it difficult
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i think people are going to get guns uh no matter what some somewhere or other so make it difficult for the for the for the good people of the world i don't think it's going to solve the problem so that's my opinion
 	
 	
 		yeah i think um  i i'm a i'm an advocate of uh gun control  um Maryland i think you'd be surprised is is very pro gun control
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah as a state in fact we have um they're now introducing some of the more  most restrictive gun control laws here in Maryland and uh the um
 		NRA did a nationwide nationwide campaign to raise money to defeat uh Maryland's um  local state laws and lost Maryland uh
 		voted in favor to have gun gun control here i think the problem is is because of um  we have there's so much crime in the adjoining community of Washington DC
 		that um we're hoping that they could you know if they put in more stricter laws then that crime won't reach out into Maryland which is in a sense a suburb of that um  i guess they're experiencing now
 		i don't know two murders or three murders a day in Washington DC normally associated with automatic weapons so i think that's the um  that's the big press up in the Northeast is that they want to remove automatic weapons
 	
 	
 		okay well yeah i
 	
 	
 		so yeah i can understand you know guns for and we everybody else in Maryland supports that and hopefully and hopefully
 	
 	
 		well we have we have a very high crime rate here in Houston
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we're dealing with uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think what you'll find though is that the East Coast is very
 	
 	
 		situation
 	
 	
 		uh is pro gun control
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i know i am but like you know you're a hunter and you're a sport you're a sport hunter that's true and and that that's why you know in a sense
 		how it doesn't it does inconvenience you but it could save lives i think is the way we look at it here and we're seeing so many murders um  between uh in in Washington DC
 	
 	
 		well do you think though that i mean if you have to wait seven days in order to purchase a gun are they really going to do these background checks and and if they really
 	
 	
 		well i think the i think the long run is is to get um
 		is to get and this is very active in the politics politics here in Maryland now then  the long run there's also there's a bill being trying to be passed right now i guess through federal the federal legislature on um  instant checkups a a total computerized system
 	
 	
 		i've heard about that but they say it's so so going to be so expensive they'll never do it
 	
 	
 		right and it's year it's years away but it it will be
 		it probably will be implemented on the East Coast first because the FBI headquarters is here in in Virginia and the this will probably be the places that will start to come in faster so yeah it will take a while before um
 		it comes in but that's one reason why i guess the the plan is here in Maryland um because i actually just received uh information from my um uh the um Brady Organization that um they want this seven day bill passed until
 		the um  the new bill until they can actually have a computerized system and i think the idea of the Brady Bill is to have this seven day waiting period to be able to check up on gun purchases or whatever
 		um until they can do it automatically on a large computerized system
 	
 	
 		yeah but what what's going to happen to the uh purchasing of guns illegally i meant i meant the guy who shot Brady was he had he purchased his gun many months before he actually committed the deed
 	
 	
 		oh sure  that's
 		that's true but he had uh he had a history of of depression and and suicidal behavior you know
 	
 	
 		that's true they that may be true but if he wanted a gun
 		i meant i meant you can purchase almost anything you want illegally meant there is a way to get it do you think he's not smart enough to figure that out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		well i don't think he would have been i think that his his type of crime i don't i don't think he would have been i think a street criminal would be you know like what you find in Washington DC
 	
 	
 		don't think so
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they would be capable of doing it i don't think this fellow would have i think i think the idea is that they also um my idea too is to remove the automatic weapons from
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		from the markets you know not to be able to purchase walk into a store and buy an automatic weapon
 	
 	
 		right
 		so you think maybe some of the people who are mentally incapacitated that will eliminate some of that which which really
 	
 	
 		right
 		it'll it'll eliminate some of the you know that that type of crime or whatever yeah and
 	
 	
 		i mean if you can eliminate any you're doing
 	
 	
 		right you can do anything yeah and i i think that's
 	
 	
 		you're doing well
 	
 	
 		you know in a sense uh i have friends that are peace activists and i'm not that extreme Everything they think that everything comes down to
 		you know the whole world but i just think that right now we should do a little bit better checking and and um and i i believe totally that automatic weapons should not be sold in this country
 		um those are you know paramilitary i don't think even sport you know do you know anybody that sport hunts with a automatic weapon
 		see and i don't either so and i do have friends my brother is a lifelong member of the NRA  so it's fun you know it's um but it's just a belief you know i guess we all work towards um what we think will make it a better society
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		um-hum  and everybody's differences of opinion are probably good that's what makes our you know
 	
 	
 		well yeah i'm you know i just you know i just couldn't understand what uh Sarah Sarah Brady just needs something to do i mean this doesn't seem to be you know what is she really going to accomplish if this goes through i mean it's really not going to solve anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but if you're also talking does this have anything her bill have anything to do with the automatic weapons yeah but it's a start
 	
 	
 		no but it's a start i think i think what you i guess you have to look at things almost just like the i guess the like the pro life and pro choice is that you start with something and if you accomplish it then you increase your objectives and and you move to the next
 	
 	
 		you can't you can't do it all at once you has to do it gradually step by step
 	
 	
 		yeah you can't do it all at once
 		yeah so once if you can um i guess if you can show the put a seven day waiting period in you can mobilize for that then you can also um  uh if you show the weakness in the NRA which is a big lobby you know hopefully you can show enough weakness
 		um from the the the gun control advocates you can show enough weakness that you can you know  get the President to put a total ban on on assault weapons or the legislatures you know
 	
 	
 		i guess once this passes in some areas and then if you after a year or so you have some statistics to work on that would show that it that yeah it does work
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's  yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it has cut down at least in this area so maybe somebody else would want to
 	
 	
 		right yeah and see now and if it doesn't work i would be the first one to say you know just like prohibition didn't work if it doesn't work i think i'd be one of the first ones to say okay you know it hasn't worked in five years it hasn't reduced any crime the statistics still show the same so
 	
 	
 		but it doesn't uh won't do anything to uh in other words step if they you know i meant i i still keep my gun and you keep your gun if you have one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it doesn't eliminate what's already out there but just
 	
 	
 		well see you already registered i think the idea is to get a better idea of who purchases guns um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		what type of person purchases what type of of gun and and and also you know the idea that somebody can go out you know a lot of the the mass murderers you know like that one fellow that walked into the Post Office purchased he was severely depressed
 		um from he'd just lost his job um the he was severely depressed he'd been taking depressant drugs or whatever and he walked into a a store bought automa tic weapons bought bullets drove immediately back to the Post Office and shot his former
 	
 	
 		oh right
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh supervisor you know and i think the idea is if you put a seven day waiting period on some of these instant crimes you know this fellow may seek help before he murders you know ideas like that
 	
 	
 		right
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and you know in in all honesty i think all of us believe that uh that um  uh you know people kill guns don't
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		you know that i i think but the idea is to is the the compulsive neurotic by gun killer
 	
 	
 		so do you think there well i guess there are quite a few of those
 	
 	
 		there there are and and they always take a number of people with them  so i
 	
 	
 		that's the unfortunate thing the innocent
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i meant not that anyone should die
 	
 	
 		yeah see and in the back of my mind if we save one life if if you save one life you have to wait seven days probably less because if you have a clean record it probably would be faster than seven days you know but you have to wait seven
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but how would how would anyone how would how if i went to buy a gun and and i had been under the care of a psychologist for the last ten years how would they have a record of that
 	
 	
 		you have to wait
 		oh they probably wouldn't not yet they probably wouldn't
 	
 	
 		i mean that's something that's privileged information that's doctor patient type thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so how how is that going to
 		you know how how is that going to work
 	
 	
 		well  they might contact maybe an immediate member of your family and and ask them if you know they thought that you were capable
 	
 	
 		oh it isn't you're really talking big bucks to start doing this kind of thing
 	
 	
 		sure yeah but i i think it's worth it you know that's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they have strict gun laws in in London and they have and England and they have very few murders by by uh automatic weapons and and uh
 		uh guns you know even the even the police for the longest time didn't really carry guns and all over Great Britain though the English
 	
 	
 		but are are there are there uh uh an equal amount of per capita number of killings by other means
 	
 	
 		no it's far less than what we have in the United States we're like the murder capital of the world  in the civilized world you know above third world countries
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure would be nice to feel safe again wouldn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah  and i don't know it's it's just who knows it's an argument i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know but i see that's the thing i totally a hundred percent see everybody's point my brother's a member of the NRA we argue about this over dinner
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and my mother and dad don't care one way or another so they just always say oh just shut up boys
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i'm glad i talked to you because i have some i got some uh information from the other side because i was
 	
 	
 		yeah well and you know what's really funny is that it
