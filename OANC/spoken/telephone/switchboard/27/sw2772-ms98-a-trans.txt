 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		okay well i can go ahead and start and tell you mine um we're from San Antonio and that's where i grew up so i was used to the heat and out here right now um gosh it gets to about seventies high seventies and it gets very cold at night
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and Monterey sits um right on the coast
 		and i don't know if your familiar with the um the California coastline but we're we're about two hours about a two hour drive south of San Francisco
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and it's uh really nice uh it's a big area for people to come from the different uh countries mostly like Japan and Germany and England and they usually go to Carmel
 		and vacation on the beaches so it's it's pretty nice uh year round but um cool always cool in the evenings and uh warm in the warm in the summer but it's stays pretty cool even uh during the winter for as nice as it is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um we usually get a fog uh right about oh i guess about four o'clock and it kind of rolls in over the coast
 		and uh then it usually breaks back off again uh the next morning and if you go just a little bit ways in i'd i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas
 		uh it the weather completely changes and it gets very hot and dry and uh the fog never makes it that far but along here it's uh very  very uh different from the the Texas type weather
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so what's it like down there
 	
 	
 		well right now we're having the the little bit of spring that we have yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really well at least you've got some
 	
 	
 		we we don't have many seasons here it goes from winter to summer usually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh spring usually consists of a lot of rain  excuse me especially thunderstorms
 		i don't know we've got we had one of those blow through tonight
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good
 	
 	
 		and i think we got  the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		it's
 	
 	
 		have y'all been having any heat waves or
 	
 	
 		uh it's gotten up to uh ninety a couple of times
 	
 	
 		like the ninety degree
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but basically been in the the low seventies and eighties
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh well that's good for this time of year
 	
 	
 		yeah it's not really been too bad because usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh oh
 		do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff up there
 	
 	
 		yeah quite a bit in fact the the season well the season's just about over for that uh in fact we drove down to Corpus last week
 	
 	
 		oh i bet
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh there there were still some indian paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way
 	
 	
 		oh i miss i miss that
 	
 	
 		funny we drove through San Antonio and i spoke to somebody else this morning from San Antonio
 		yeah we're
 		they had that we came back what day was that
 		Sunday evening and they had a a big rainstorm come through there part of the same thing we're getting now i guess
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		well that's real nice because i can remember um two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued
 		so at least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas i'm glad to hear that
 	
 	
 		yeah this that's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy spring we had a pretty rainy fall last year as well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		y'all weren't getting any of the strings of uh the tornadoes and stuff were you
 	
 	
 		um we had a few down here but but not anything like Kansas and this is the season for that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh okay
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		they do they do pop up occasionally around here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh  yeah i really don't miss all the heat here it's i'm getting acclimated to having the cool evenings so we get a bit of a relief
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm i'm from here originally so July and August i'm pretty well used to the hundred degree temperatures and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the the biggest problem with with the with the weather and the rain in this area is the the soil it's that black clay soil
 	
 	
 		oh is that what Dallas is okay yeah
 	
 	
 		it's kind of sandy you know it's not sandy like most of the state is so it doesn't absorb
 		the water real well i mean once it rains a little bit it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's filled up and everything else just runs off so
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come it's a complete it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes so i didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we have it especially especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years there's a
 		uh there's a section in South Dallas that has had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain
 	
 	
 		huh golly well we could use some rain up here we're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		up here and they they had a pretty good early spring and we got quite a bit of rain but it wasn't enough to offset what they had lost over the last four years
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so they're still talking water rationing this summer
 		so uh it would seem strange because in San Antonio um we had lived out um west of San Antonio in Castroville
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down and they were considering um
 		that they might have to do water rationing and then i thought oh gee i'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the the California Pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers and there's no problem with water and then i came here and found out they were in
 		you know in the four year drought so i said well gee this is pretty much like Texas and it pretty much is in the middle of summer they have rolling hills around here but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um they they turn to golden dead grass for the majority of the summer just because there is no water to keep them green
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um it's a really nice area uh
 		it's just it's just such a change uh from Texas because i had grown up with uh the heat and was used to essentially like you said you have the cold winter and then you have the hot
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		summer spring  and uh to come here it's kind of the the temperate weather all year round it's kind of like um spring i guess if you uh year round
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		except and then in the the winter and then it seems sort of like a San Antonio um early winter or fall year round so it seems like we only have two springs which is or two seasons and that would be spring and fall and we never really get any of the other ones
 	
 	
 		huh uh-huh
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but it is it's a really nice uh change of pace
 	
 	
 		i guess i'd prefer that
 	
 	
 		yeah to the to the heat i really don't miss the heat um we do a lot of you know when you do a lot of outside like running and stuff out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just so much easier up here and you don't have to worry about the high high humidity does Dallas get high humidity
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		we we it's pretty dry we get some when it's this rainy but it's nothing like i guess San Antonio summers it's nothing like Houston
 	
 	
 		or is it pretty dry
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for instance it'd be or east Texas is a little more humid
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems like San Antonio has been increasing in humidity over the years because i had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years
 		and it just seemed like every year it just got a little more humid a little more humid and here it's uh well it's right by the ocean but um it's not the same as at Corpus at Corpus you you get that humid salty
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		feeling in the air but here um the well the water is extremely cold up here you can lay on the beach all you want but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		and a thick wet suit at that because it's just extremely cold and i for some reason i guess it's because of that cold uh ocean
 		uh water that the air is always cool it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling so i really like that about this area
 		and uh we just hadn't expected it we were used to what uh uh gulf coast uh weather was like and we came here to Pacific coast weather it's just completely different and it's much nicer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference in that
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh it does and the um the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region but um but we like it so it's a nice change so we'll be here a couple of years and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like
 	
 	
 		that's nice
 	
 	
 		and uh so it's been good
 	
 	
 		yeah my wife's originally from Virginia and we lived there for about nine months and that was a real change for me
 	
 	
 		oh i imagine that Virginia i imagine gets really humid doesn't it
 	
 	
 		um parts do we uh we were over in the in the western edge in the mountains
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they have of course some pretty severe
 		storms uh winter storms snow and that type of thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they're so good about clearing the roads that you know it doesn't usually bother you very much
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah  not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still you know uh
 	
 	
 		yeah and and their springs and summers are pretty mild too it never gets real real hot there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh yeah i'll have to try that out because i had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i've just never really been in that region of the country and i guess i'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like because a lot of people that are from that  North Carolina region really like it
 		and uh they like they get the snow but they said it doesn't really get messy and it doesn't really hang around that long and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they the people i know that are from there uh
 		they always miss it and they want to go back  nothing seems quite as good yeah but anyway
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well funny as we were talking the weather came on and there's a flash flood watch and
 	
 	
 		well
 		oh gee whiz
 	
 	
 		more rain for the next three or four days
 	
 	
 		oh gosh oh well i hope it moves up this way but i'm sure it won't
 	
 	
 		yeah maybe we can send you some
 	
 	
 		yeah because we could sure use it
 		okay well you think that takes care of the the time and
 	
 	
 		i think that'll do it
 	
 	
 		okay well i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and uh
 	
 	
 		well i enjoyed talking with you Lisa
 	
 	
 		yeah good luck to you okay we'll see you um bye
 	
 	
 		uh-huh you too

 		bye bye
