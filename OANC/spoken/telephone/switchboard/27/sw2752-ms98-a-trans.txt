 
     		
 	
 		okay yes we do have pollution in Houston and it
 	
 	
 		how bad is it do you have smog like they do in California
 	
 	
 		well it it some i think it depends on uh you know what the how the cloud cover and like right now it's uh
 		it's kind of overcast you know just it's hot and the sun is trying tries to shine through but it it's it's holding in this this pollution and i i think so and uh we have uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take yeah
 	
 	
 		Pasadena Texas which is sort of between here and you know heading toward Galveston i mean it's still part it's part of the Houston metropolitan
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		what do you think is your primary cause of it
 	
 	
 		well i think it's industry and i think it's cars i
 	
 	
 		you do you really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas
 	
 	
 		i don't i well maybe not but it it sure it sure seems you know it i i know that when i'm when i'm behind a car and uh sometimes
 		uh i can really smell especially diesel and things like that you know comes right in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to my air conditioner and you know my head and my face i'm so stopped up right now i don't know if it's uh if it's partly from what's blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that that's part of it but um
 	
 	
 		hm my goodness
 		um-hum
 		i think a lot of it's industrial i also think uh that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles but it's mostly from older automobiles i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting uh frankly i think that uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think that um
 		uh if uh i i i heard a story a while back something effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off of the road that have been
 		uh manufactured say before nineteen seventy five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you mean uh fifty percent pollution total from that comes from
 	
 	
 		yeah from from cars that is not from not total but just from cars okay
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that i think would be a tremendous help and i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical and it just keeps getting uh
 		gives me good service and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money on the other hand i know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies and uh that may be part of the problem also
 	
 	
 		right well
 		do y'all have pollution in your country part of the country uh from industry
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah oh uh yeah it's it's uh pretty heavy up here i think but i think it's mostly industrial is what i really uh believe is the the main problem and
 		and uh
 		and uh uh people uh i don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should i i we we seem to have a high uh cancer rate up here in Maryland
 	
 	
 		really like what kind any particular kind or just all kinds
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh
 		well uh for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant and uh i think of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody
 		but uh this this this state was like uh second my wife's a registered nurse and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of uh cancer rate
 		for just all kinds and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is but i just can't believe this now we have a lot of pollution being caused by chlorofluorocarbons uh fluorocarbons
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		which is the like freon twelve and freon twenty two they use freon twenty two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also and having all kinds of effects and
 	
 	
 		well what can we do about the the the the air conditioning problem
 	
 	
 		well they're working now i know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons and whoever does is gonna make a a mint because if they ever come up with a reasonable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		working agent in place of fluorocarbons then uh
 	
 	
 		is that also what's in uh hairspray aerosol
 	
 	
 		well they used to be but they made them take it out of that
 	
 	
 		even uh so so the aerosol is still aerosol but it doesn't have anything that's damaging
 	
 	
 		right
 		no they they they made passed a law and made them take fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers
 	
 	
 		um-hum well that's good
 	
 	
 		and that was a move in the right direction we are doing some things to try to correct the problem but there are more things we could do and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem
 		uh uh just trying to i think be careful uh with the way you handle garbage i notice in this state i don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces
 		uh you know containers in yeah
 	
 	
 		here they've just started started doing that it's it's you know you're not you don't have to but most you know i i know i am i save
 	
 	
 		yeah well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too but they uh in one of the counties here they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police
 		they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid and she spot checks people's trash and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash they'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 		you really oh
 		is that right
 		well we need to do something we need to get serious about it
 	
 	
 		yeah you right you got to give people incentives and surprisingly enough just handling of trash uh can cut pollution
 		uh from uh uh from just throwing it in a dump or or or or whatever else they used to do with it maybe used to burn it they've stopped that up here too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but that that will cut pollution too because you get a lot of out gassing from these things i think decaying and trying and trying to for instance cans and bottles they never go away at all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well on on the other had i don't guess they're polluting but plastic containers and the like uh they may be
 		ah i'm not sure of that
 	
 	
 		how much does uh planting more trees and things like that help
 	
 	
 		oh i think that's very important to do i i really think that uh trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing and uh that can help to cut pollution i guess some i i don't know how much
 	
 	
 		i have too
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air i would hope that they would help some though that's for sure
 	
 	
 		well i think uh it seems like there was something going on around around here that you know we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kinds of things and that  they burn off a lot of stuff and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		somebody found out you know like in the middle of the night they would go ahead and do it anyway i think they got caught but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff you know goes on
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		well that uh that i think may go on a lot
 		and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late night or something i don't think we have a adequate policing
 		uh especially particularly on industry
 		uh we have good policing at least in this state and and uh several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants because we have to go down uh once a year here in Maryland and get our car's exhaust systems checked for emissions content
 	
 	
 		well we have to uh we have to have a state inspection every year do y'all have that so which i i don't i would assume
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh no we don't have a state inspection but anytime you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state
 	
 	
 		so i'm  i'm assuming that you know they check  they check everything for safety or
 	
 	
 		i don't know uh it that's something that you'd have to just chec k with your authorities but in this state we have to uh pay eight dollars and a half and go to a an emission station once a year
 		and get everyone of our cars checked that are have been made starting in nineteen seventy three
 	
 	
 		but that's all they check for they don't check how good your if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough or
 	
 	
 		no no we don't have inspections like that now i'm in Maryland in Virginia they check that every two years i think
 	
 	
 		we do that every every year
 	
 	
 		and i think that's a good idea too not not not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily necessarily but i think it's a good idea the emissions check though is required in Maryland and it's also required in Virginia
 		uh a sister state to to this and that's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants
 	
 	
 		well i'll have to check i'm not sure if if our state inspection every once a year has to do you know if they check the
 	
 	
 		um-hum well if they don't i would imagine in time they'll get along with it they'll get around to it and if they don't then that's something i would certainly certainly uh uh suggest you'd be willing to uh um be for in terms of uh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		emissions
 		oh i would  i'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or or or anything on that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i i agree now that's another area we hadn't even discussed and that is water pollution and various of the other types of uh
 		of uh like food pollution i mean you you hardly ever hear hear anybody say anything about food pollution but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this country so
 		uh hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food but water pollution uh
 		i've worried uh especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like i know a lot more people are going to bottled water
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well and that's not necessarily the answer either because they found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		tap yeah
 	
 	
 		but a lot of these uh some of this well you know a lot of people have well water in fact in this area too and you know and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what your what your drinking on i know i know a lot of people you know have that and you know you have to wonder if that you know it could have an adverse effect on them too if they don't if they don't get it checked
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course have it checked because it seems uh when i was a kid growing up down south uh i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were and we had a well with one of those draws that
 		i forget what you call those things and and that was some of the best tasting water i mean i can still to this day taste that water
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		when we were when i was growing up i lived in Huntsville Alabama and their water supply came from uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		spring and it was like ice cold spring water and i guess parts of the the city still have you know get that but uh that was that was really wonderful it was really really good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 		oh i bet it was yeah the it once it's been filtered and if it's a deep enough well filtered through all the earth and everything i think that uh it depends of course where you are a good well though i think is very healthy
