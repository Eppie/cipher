 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		what what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		few are uh basically staying home and
 		being homemakers and raising kids exclusively
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i i i grew up in uh sixties and early seventies and uh my mom didn't work at all when i was growing up she didn't start working until i was
 		um well into high school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids
 		it's a luxury item for
 		mothers to be home with their kids
 	
 	
 		yeah true well mine taught kindergarten but she was always uh
 		i guess her schedule was shorter so she was always uh home
 	
 	
 		always home by the time you got home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that that statistic i guess has been growing every year it's it's something around sixty sixty five percent or so now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i'm not sure what the future holds for that whether
 	
 	
 		it seems like there's it seems like there's a grass roots um
 		effort or whatever going on i i um clean houses part-time and almost all the people that i clean for believe it or not are mothers that don't work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that's unusual
 	
 	
 		they're all um it's and it's i think it's kind of a new movement it's going back towards
 		you know women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where you know
 		women stayed home with the kids you know and try to give the kids quality time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i i think that in the future you're i think you're going to see a lot more
 		women choosing to not work after they have a baby
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think with uh
 		the uh
 		the work force with the the salaries that a lot of a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are um vice presidents of companies and i think with uh um
 		it seems like it's more the upper-class people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i don't see it as much the like in my situation where i don't i don't have children yet but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids but realistically that's i'm i'm
 		realizing that's probably not going to be possible
 		um for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income
 	
 	
 		yeah that is tough yeah we're looking at that now my wife's about six months along
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know it's going to kind of  kind of go along with the BMW in the driveway and or in the garage or whatever um and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever
 	
 	
 		true
 		yeah
 		i'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home
 		i would think it would be women that were working full-time
 	
 	
 		yeah believe it or not though the all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home um they're real active in volunteer work
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		one of the women is real active with uh muscular dystrophy
 		and uh does a lot of of work with them
 		on a volunteer basis but it's still it's almost like a job but she just doesn't get paid for it
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well i guess that's good they got something to keep them active
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		when when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home or is she going to go back to work
 	
 	
 		yeah we're going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible
 		what do you think
 	
 	
 		that that that i would i would like to be able to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah we think it's uh that important and
 		i i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction i'm a a counselor and a therapist and i work with adolescents and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure
 	
 	
 		yeah i i see a difference in the generation of
 		even the generation before me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh were you know mom was like um Mrs Cleaver uh you know June Cleaver or whatever where the the attitudes were a lot different um
 		as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more
 		um
 		there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um a lot of the the things that are going on in today's society i think morally
 		um it seems like there was
 		the people people were a lot better back then as far as having higher standards
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		well the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure and
 		and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too so kids are raised around their friends and by the media
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true
 		and i think i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future
 	
 	
 		that's contributed
 		yeah maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time so
 		if there was some way for for women to to stay home even if they could work you know there are a lot of
 		jobs that are coming about like in computers at home and those types of things that would
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		at least in some ways
 		bridge the gap
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that um
 		in the future um the the family unit as it as it once was known is is going to be nonexistent
 		where do how do what do you think
 	
 	
 		about
 	
 	
 		uh as far as do do you think there's going to be still a family unit or or do you think that um the trend is going more towards single parenting
 	
 	
 		they'll understand them
 		the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while um
 		it's hard to say
 		families are such a strange configuration anymore
 		um i i see a lot of families where you know in the in the
 		back i grew up about the same time you did
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		back in those times we
 		pretty much were taught how to be responsible
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		nowadays it's not the case kids don't kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk and
 		one of the reasons i guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working
 		they get bombarded with junk and they don't have to do anything around the house they never learned to be responsible when the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so  know you create a bigger bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		it's not not a real functional situation anyway
 		i don't know it's i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families and the blended families
 		as long as we 've got so many other crazy things going on in society
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think that eventually the the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore
 		it's it is that like you said the divorce rate is getting so high
 		that i think there's going to be more single parent families than there are
 		um
 		you know two parent families
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's pretty sad
 	
 	
 		yeah it is i guess unless unless there's a a major swing in the change of what's important to people
 		you know probably keep going downhill
 		and i i don't know we we feel like that that we can make it on one income it it may be tough but we may have to give up some
 		some things
 	
 	
 		i i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that it'll make the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the strain worthwhile
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so too
 	
 	
 		well i need to go ahead and and wrap it up it was really nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well i've enjoyed it Stephanie
 	
 	
 		and uh thanks a lot okay bye bye
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		bye-bye
