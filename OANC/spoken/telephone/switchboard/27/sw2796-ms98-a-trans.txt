 
     		
 	
 		well i currently don't have a pet although uh i have in the past
 	
 	
 		oh
 		you don't have one
 	
 	
 		not right now we
 	
 	
 		i have a cat and a dog both
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh well you should have a lot to talk about then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh well no the place i live in is a little too small right now for uh for a pet i hate to hate to keep a dog or something like that and not have enough room for it to run around in so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i guess you don't have that problem at least with the cat
 	
 	
 		no i have
 		i have a house that uh has a a fairly good sized yard and
 		uh i also i'm here
 		by at night by myself because my husband works at night and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i i wanted a dog for protection and we
 	
 	
 		i can imagine
 	
 	
 		and we got a Dalmatian
 	
 	
 		that's a pretty big dog
 	
 	
 		yeah and he
 	
 	
 		that's a pretty dog though
 	
 	
 		he's wonderful because uh
 		he's really protective
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh that was probably our main reason for getting him but
 	
 	
 		how's how's he like the cat or how's the cat like the dog i guess it
 	
 	
 		oh he loves the cat the dog uh
 		Sam our Dalmatian loves the cat but the cat just really doesn't care about the dog at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know he'll slap at him and
 		hiss at him and everything and the cat stays in
 		all the time  so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's a uh you know barrier there but yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess it's a good reason to to have a pet then as protection i guess is one thing
 	
 	
 		hm yeah it is
 	
 	
 		but uh i guess i they're a lot of company though yeah friendship they're an awful lot of company
 	
 	
 		friendship yeah
 		yeah oh Sam is very loving if
 		if one of us are out in the yard you know he wants to jump and play and lick a
 		typical puppy type atmosphere although he's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		almost two years old but
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah the cat is a lot of companionship
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he just he's real old and he kind of lays around just wants you pet him and and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		doesn't doesn't get too excited about anything
 	
 	
 		no not at all not at all
 	
 	
 		he's not one of those cats that like to sit on top of the television is he
 	
 	
 		no  my mom has a cat though that does that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's kind of weird we haven't figured that out yet
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've noticed how they get black cats it seems like they always wanna sit on top of the television set and let their tail only when when there's something you really want to see then they let their tail down in front of the TV set in front of the screen and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they they just seem to know i guess
 	
 	
 		just intuition or something instinct in a way
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		it it sounds like you have pretty normal pets though i guess uh you know a lot of people i mean i guess i've never cared for birds or fish or um or gerbils or anything like that but dogs and cats are about the only thing i think of when i think of pets
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i've i've never had any the ones that you just mentioned i have had a rabbit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was pretty interesting and it was like a cat it stayed in the house all the time and it used a litter box
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it had free run of the house
 	
 	
 		was it as was it as friendly as a cat or do you do you think you uh
 	
 	
 		uh not not to strangers not strangers at all matter of fact it would run and hide but after it got to know you it was funny because it would jump up on the couch and sit right next to you you know and it kind of pants
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i didn't know a rabbit panted but  they pant kind of like a dog
 	
 	
 		neither did i
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it's kind of funny because you can just sit there and pet them and
 		my rabbit got real large i think he was thirteen pounds
 	
 	
 		oh gee that is a big rabbit
 	
 	
 		so he was really big that was kind of funny looking
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		but uh was
 	
 	
 		but he was a good guard
 	
 	
 		was he
 	
 	
 		yeah at he heard every little noise and you could tell when a car drove up or anything
 	
 	
 		but but he's not much protection i would imagine
 	
 	
 		oh no no
 		no i don't think so
 	
 	
 		not not not an attack rabbit or anything like that
 	
 	
 		no nothing like that
 	
 	
 		not real protective but uh
 		well i i guess that's about  to say about pets
 	
 	
 		okay thanks bye-bye
 	
 	
 		all right well very nice speaking to you bye-bye
