 
     		
 	
 		so have you got a pet
 	
 	
 		no i don't my kids would love a pet  i had a pet when i was a girl i had a Cocker Spaniel
 		and i think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company you can you can tell them anything and they won't tell anybody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right that's like unconditional affection
 	
 	
 		right as a matter of fact i was thinking that same thing unconditional love they just give it and don't expect too much anyway do you have a pet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i had a cat i've had several cats my cat uh
 		was hit by a car New Year's Eve but uh i'm gonna get another one as soon as i
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		get back in town i'm going out of town this weekend when i get back i'm gonna find a cat
 	
 	
 		oh i'm so sorry but that's good that you're gonna get another one  i know some of my friends who have pets uh and they just are really
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know the ones who have dogs are very uh protective of them and i think that's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets but they just um
 		really take care of them are and are protective of them
 	
 	
 		yeah i work and go to school and it's kind of nice you know you come home your your pet's there for you and wants to wants a little food a little attention
 	
 	
 		yeah and and like my kids um they really want a dog badly
 	
 	
 		and that's it's kind of fun
 	
 	
 		and they've been looking and looking and want you know they'd take anything i think  but um i don't know do you like i guess your cat was an indoor cat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no it was an indoor kind of indoor outdoor it
 	
 	
 		a kind of traveled around traveled
 	
 	
 		it was well yeah i don't i don't care for the smell of a litter box so my cat was trained to go outside other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when you know it
 	
 	
 		yeah when i had a Cocker Spaniel it it was an outdoor dog and uh i think i liked that better uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i think you know i like dogs but i think that uh i'm i'm kind of like big dogs big dogs and you have to have room for them
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and dogs take a lot of
 		a lot more care than cats do cats are pretty independent you know you feed them and they keep themselves clean and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		if you if you raise them right you know you don't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to
 		let them out and take them for walks and
 	
 	
 		take them for walks right
 	
 	
 		things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i see all the people on on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs and
 		and i i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog i'm like i know it'll be fun the first week maybe and then mom gets to take care of it or something so i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i got to take care a friend of mine's dog he's just got a puppy and he was out of town  last weekend and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet so it's go over there and clean up after the dog and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's exciting
 	
 	
 		that's that's a major chore you know if you don't
 		if you don't keep up with it and uh kids kind of they want the they want the fun part and not the not the work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think it's really important to that that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that you know we're not just
 		going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them that that kind of gripes on me some but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't know more and more people are aware
 	
 	
 		well if you're if you're gonna have a pet and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to you know deal with the consequences take care of the offspring and
 	
 	
 		right right
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		and i think you know when i was growing up we had cats cats
 		and you know just seeing the cats you know the the the miracle of birth you know put that in quotes is that's a that's a neat thing to to experience as a kid and understand and and it was a real positive thing but on the other hand you don't wanna
 	
 	
 		i think that's really true
 	
 	
 		you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road you know they're they're they're getting old now and it's time to get rid of them so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah exactly exactly i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too and  and that's good too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i think that's all i have to say okay have a good night all right bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay well it's good talking to you yeah bye
