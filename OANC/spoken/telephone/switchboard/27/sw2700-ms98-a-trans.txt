 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well how would you rate it
 	
 	
 		uh well i'm kind of in the middle i lived in the Ozarks for a long time where a lot of people do a lot of hunting and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now i live in Dallas where there's a lot of crime and i'm all for uh the average Joe being able to have a gun but then again i'm not you know as far as this seven day law and all this stuff for two weeks or whatever i'm all for that too i don't think anybody needs to be able to go buy a gun right away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if you want a gun for a legitimate purpose you should be willing to wait
 		long enough for someone to verify that you're not a
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		yeah that that's true i'm i'm kind of like you you know i don't i'm kind of in between but i i'd rather not rate it at all because i think it's very site specific
 	
 	
 		a potential criminal
 		yeah and i i don't think you know i think it's one of the constitutional rights that
 		is important and you know we we should be allowed to have guns
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't think they should turn around and say you know the government says you can't have a gun because that just
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		right it doesn't make sense if if you can govern yourself
 	
 	
 		any any any country where they've ever revolted you know it takes guns to revolt and sure we don't need to but uh never know there might come a time
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think you know it's like you're saying is you know were in in places in communities where hunting is common yeah you can't ban guns there it's not it's kind of impossible it's a way of life for people
 		but uh
 		in in cities i think there there may be a possibility for certain law restricting firearms in certain areas maybe not the ownership
 		of such but it's restricting the you know the the uh presence of of hand guns in certain areas
 	
 	
 		well they do that now i mean you're not supposed to have a hand guns well maybe you're allowed to have them say in the city but you're not allowed to use them in the city limits and things
 	
 	
 		no that's what i'm saying like not have one in the city like you can have one but you can't have one in your apartment if it's you know cause you're in the city
 		like you may have it at a summer home or somewhere else
 		yeah just because you live in the city doesn't mean you can't have it but you just can't have it in the city
 	
 	
 		well what does that do to people that uh use it for protection like
 		you know i personally i don't have a gun but i wouldn't mind having one i live in a neighborhood where the crime rate is going up somebody breaks in my house i wouldn't mind having a gun you know in self-defense but uh
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah well you know i see i don't know the statistics for that for
 		you know how if if by having a gun how much that really helps so i don't really know that's why i think that maybe if not maybe not just having one will be better that's that's why
 		i i wouldn't know because i'm not from the city
 		so i don't i don't see the very high crime rate
 		
 
 		you on the other hand may have a different opinion
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well i've never had it had to have one in the city you know when i was in the country we used them and out there was a necessity i mean you don't kill a copperhead with a rock
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		you shoot them
 	
 	
 		exactly as you know as i'm i'm from uh you know rural
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i go hunting a lot
 	
 	
 		i think there need to be stronger
 		gun control laws that can be that can uh
 		that uh what am i trying to say in in cities in urban areas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't think guns should be banned i just think it should be harder for for a criminal to get hold of them and of course the black market anyone can get one if they want one
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah the bad things is that you know when you try to make it harder for criminals to get them how do you know if you're selling to a criminal or not
 	
 	
 		well that i guess that's the whole point of some of this legislation they're they're trying to make
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i mean you can't you can't ever really determine that i mean you can sell it to a straight person and and then he becomes a truant yeah yeah that's like shit
 	
 	
 		he turns around and yeah turns passes it on yeah there's no perfect answer
 		but i guess i'm i'm more for i'm more for no i'm actually more for less control because i think it's it's a right that that i would hate to see us lose
 	
 	
 		more for some kind of control huh
 		yeah well i don't want to see it
 	
 	
 		and the more the more you give gun control the little bit the little bit of time before long you don't have anything
 		i mean i'm sure when they started out with taxes they didn't plan on taking thirty percent of your income but uh
 	
 	
 		but it sounds good to them
 	
 	
 		they just start with a little bit you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think you know maybe some kind of condition some kind i think they should ban uh automatic weapons
 		for you know only only and restrict them to uh gun clubs only
 		i don't know if they've they've completed that action or not
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know what the deal is on that i know you can't buy them any more you can't can't buy imported ones anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 		and well uh i mean that doesn't really matter imported or or you know domestic machine guns they still do the same damage
 	
 	
 		or is it the other way around
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i don't see i don't see what the difference is myself you know getting shot by
 	
 	
 		i don't see any reason for anybody to have one unless they're fighting a war you know
 	
 	
 		i mean in a gun club or something you know in a gun club or or have the wrong reason in mind those two are the
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		that's why i think that maybe you know you if you say you can't have an automatic weapon that's that's also saying that you can't have a gun
 		so if you say you can have it but you have to be a member of gun club that that restricts it even further
 		doesn't doesn't take away your right it just puts a restriction on your right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but
 		i don't you know i think i think restrictions are going to be needed but no no bans or anything like that
 		it's kind of hard though because in different regions different regions like you were saying is uh is different like there where you're at you wouldn't mind having a gun so you you're really
 	
 	
 		yeah i wouldn't need an Uzi though
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or a UB forty i mean a
 		a pistol would be fine it's more for a scare tactic than anything else
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't really want to shoot somebody but i guess if uh it was me or him i would have to yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a good deterrent
 	
 	
 		course you've got people that are pulling them out on the highways down here
 		it's like you cut them off and boom
 		blow you away
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you have to draw the line i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		so if we're supposed to pick a number i'd guess i'd pick oh what no gun control was
 		was ten
 	
 	
 		well total ban is one and uh no ban at all is ten
 	
 	
 		i guess i'd have to pick about an eight
 		something down there toward the low end
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i think well around seven or eight restricting certain kinds and and leaving others out with restrictions but i don't know what that you know like you were saying the uh the seven day restriction or seven day wait period or something like that
 	
 	
 		well supposedly in seven days they're going they're going to look through y our background and make sure you are not an ex-con or don't have
 	
 	
 		what does that mean that that really doesn't you know it's just because it gives them time to look you up doesn't mean i mean it
 		it it may be well intended but i don't know how effective it is
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't either it might stop some people but
 		some people with a history of something but uh
 		you know i guess there's a lot of information out there on everybody whether we we believe it or not they know everything you've done for the last
 		ever since you got a social security number really
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		so uh i guess they've got some time to make sure you haven't been in prison or don't have a history of
 		you know i don't know
 	
 	
 		so then it's it's uh up to the the individual dealer
 	
 	
 		i don't know i really don't know what the the actual on how how they work that out
 		i imagine with the the way everything is computerized now it won't take much you know a perspective buyer comes in and they throw in your social security number on some nationally network system and it based on whatever criteria it's got it says yes or no
 		this guy can get a gun or he can't and whoever decides those criterias you know that's something the legislatures do
 	
 	
 		yeah but what does does the uh does the retailer have the opportunity to you know disregard that information that he receives
 	
 	
 		i really don't know
 		i don't know what the you know what the status of those laws are
 	
 	
 		because you know if if it's if it's not against the law for the retailer to disregard that information that kind of defeats the whole purpose of the seven day wait period
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i would think if they're going to make a law it would have to be something uh
 	
 	
 		national
 	
 	
 		it'd be a crime to uh not enforce it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		oh well man i guess that's about five minutes
 	
 	
 		all right uh
 	
 	
 		all right nice talking to you Ralph Ralph bye
 	
 	
 		take care yeah bye
