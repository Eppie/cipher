 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		great um currently i'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm mainly do a lot of walking um i have a son that's a little bit overweight and um the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around so my wife and i kind of take turns
 		um at one time i had a a fairly regular exercise program
 		but in the last couple of months i've changed to a a new residence
 		and everything has gotten kind of turned upside down all this space that uh normally would be dedicated towards the exercise area is uh covered in boxes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um what did you do when you exercised when you did exercise regularly
 	
 	
 		well i had a a a little routine that i i did for uh warm ups and then i did some uh very
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		mild mild say light weight lifting
 		nothing and i'm not trying to make big bulging muscles just trying to try stay as firm as i can stay in my old age
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		well right now um
 		i try to when it's nice out it's been raining a lot this spring but i try to i have a bicycle and i like to cycle a lot
 		and uh my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that's pretty popular in Texas i don't know if it's up north but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		like every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally and uh thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles
 		which that's a lot of fun um so we try to ride ride during the week to stay in shape for that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um TI where i work has uh a fitness center so
 		a lot of times after work or maybe on the weekend we'd go over there and lift weights and do the treadmill and um
 		they have stair masters and all kinds of new machines that are fun to ride and
 		and workout on so
 		i try to i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis
 		i used to get into it and then get out of it based on my schedule so i'm trying to stay in in shape on a regular basis now
 		but it's a big commitment we don't have any kids yet so that's a lot of the part of it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's that's a plus uh i have a total of five children i have three left living at home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they do take up a big part of my uh my evening and weekend
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's tough being a parent and trying to do all the things that you should do for yourself too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's uh something they don't tell you about when you're growing up
 		yes when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's why uh they they uh really stress
 		um at TI they really stress staying in shape but like in staying fit overall fitness you know no smoking and all that but
 		it's it's hard to find uh a actual exercise regimen that works for you you know
 		because like i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them on the bikes and i don't know if that would work for me because
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain but you know it's really hard to find something that works
 		and it you know to find time
 		to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever
 		i think maybe walking or running would probably work because you it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well there's you you have to
 		uh what i found from my experiences you have to budget time for yourself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then uh the you you can use what ever rationale you want but basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then i'll be around a lot longer
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		those people that i'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now well you know get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i hadn't taken it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine
 	
 	
 		yeah um i've been learning a lot lately about
 		um i've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper i don't know if you're familiar are familiar with him
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really he's kind of redid
 		um uh just pretty much
 		the  innovator of the whole exercise thing um and he was talking about the three things you could that cause
 		aging are smoking inactivity and what was the other one
 		i think it was yeah obesity so if you can control those three areas then you are going to live longer you know
 		because those are risk factors so
 		anyway it's kind of a tip
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh i've done a lot of study over the years and i found that uh
 		probably one of the worst things that uh anybody can ingest is chlorinated water
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah um the research i've done and uh i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty three and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's it's amazing that uh you know like prior to like nineteen twenty there were not very few heart attacks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there were none prior to nineteen hundred well in nineteen oh three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water and then after that we started having the hearts attacks
 	
 	
 		man
 	
 	
 		and uh Dr Price wrote a book Coronarys Cholesterol and Chlorine you can usually find it at a health food store
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i know they had it in health food stores in Plano i used to live in Plano
 	
 	
 		Dr Price
 	
 	
 		that's
 		uh Dr Price yeah and it's amazing he makes the in you know it's a very small book and the guy's very opinionated
 		um but he makes a very good case against chlorine there were no heart attacks before we started using it and he says points out that people in uh England and uh or eating diets
 		that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks and
 	
 	
 		that's really interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know he's uh there's been a lot of reports since then and this whole thing about you know first it was stress then they went to cholesterol and now they're saying what's cholesterol well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it's it's it's amazing what he points out in that book and that um in fact he even uh there was a uh toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency
 		who did work back in nineteen eighty six who wrote a letter to Dr Price in nineteen eighty seven
 		and in this letter he praised Dr Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and said that the EPA had been doing experiments on non human primates and proving that ingestation of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis
 		and EPA never published that report
 	
 	
 		and what's the name of this book again
 	
 	
 		uh Coronaries Cholesterol and Chlorine
 	
 	
 		i'll have to remember that that'd be really interesting my husband wants to go into med school and be a neurosurgeon so he's really interested in the heart
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he's in fact he's a well heart too i mean he's uh
 		he's done a lot of research on
 		like how your heart
 		re reacts reacts to exercise
 		sorry he just made me laugh um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 		anyway
 		i have to remember that
 	
 	
 		yeah there's there's a there's a lot of good information out there
 		uh about health and a lot of the uh a lot of the myths they've been passing around people are
 		are starting to realize aren't true i mean i'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because that's that's good for you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but to to believe some of the things that they you know and i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high high fat diet
 		but to think that that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		it's just hard to believe
 	
 	
 		if you get a chance read Dr Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's a real good um he talks about that talks about
 		high risk factors and heart disease and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah i actually
 		eat pretty much anything that i want
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i've had my cholesterol checked and uh you know a few times and i've never been above uh like a hundred and fifty
 		never
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh i mean i
 	
 	
 		you have a good ratio of good to bad cholesterol
 	
 	
 		um
 		you you
 		well what they tell me but i mean you know
 		everything's like within uh five to ten percent and all that kind of thing you know
 		they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh we've uh i work at the TI site in Hunt Valley Maryland
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and we've had a few of the health fairs up here and
 		you know i've always come out aces
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		and i'm you know i'm not really that big on on watching what i eat
 		i i do eat you know some health cookies that are high in fiber and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		low in fat and all that kind of stuff but i mean as far as being really concerned about
 		ingesting too much uh chlorine i'm not or cholesterol i'm not worried about
