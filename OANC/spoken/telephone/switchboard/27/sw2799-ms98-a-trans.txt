 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		hello okay
 	
 	
 		yeah okay
 	
 	
 		um
 		do you work at TI
 	
 	
 		no i don't do you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		what company are you are you working at all
 	
 	
 		yeah i work for NCNB
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and let's see the question was what benefits you consider most important i think uh definitely medical and dental insurance
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um life insurance long-term disability uh vacation
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		vacation
 	
 	
 		oh yeah don't ever think of those as a benefit but they sure are
 	
 	
 		yeah and um
 		i think what i don't like some of the policies that our company has that i don't like i don't like their sick leave policy their short-term disability policy and i would like to see them do something about um child care
 	
 	
 		yeah what is their sick leave policy
 	
 	
 		oh it's only like i don't know like six days a year which is way below the national average
 	
 	
 		is it paid
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh do you get penalized for taking it off
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		the reason why i said is um TI uh the hourly employees
 		um they have i'm not sure up to five years they have a certain number of days and after five years they have um unlimited uh personal time off but
 		if they miss more than say ten point five hours in a three month period they get penalized for it so really they don't ever huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's not even two days that's not even two days and what if you get the flu and you're sick for a week or two
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		the problem is with that is that we work eleven or we work twelve hour days so no one could even take off a day for pay you know PTO um because they get penalized for it
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they lose their certification pay which is like fifty five cents an hour for three whole months so it's really not a very good benefit
 	
 	
 		wow
 		no that's in fact  i wouldn't call that much of a benefit at all
 		i think you know people get sick and if you get sick usually you're sick for more than a day and then you know if your children get sick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you know parents have to take time off for that and um
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the biggest thing and people come to work sick but when their kids get sick it's like well i can't afford to take off but i have to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i think you know it varies from manager to manager some managers keep track of it and some managers don't and it's really unfair you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's true it is it's not really uh consistent
 	
 	
 		but i think you know at NCNB in any any work place being a single parent i think that child care is my greatest expense and um
 		you know it's it's getting to the point where you just can't afford it anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah i really wish that somebody in big companies or any company would take a hint from like that movie Nine to Five did you see that where they had the child care right there on the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right there yes
 	
 	
 		that was so good and that would help the morale of parents i think so much
 	
 	
 		yes very much very much
 	
 	
 		because i hate to see that i mean probably ninety percent of the people that work for me are single parents and they have to you know use child care at least for a couple hours a days
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i don't know i i really think a big company needs to take responsibility for that
 	
 	
 		and i think they should even do something for when children are sick you know provide facilities for sick children
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		although i know that's not very comfortable for the children when they're sick they probably just would rather stay home but um
 		you know  my options are you know to either call in sick to take to take him to one of those places that takes care of sick children um
 		you know and that's about it you know a lot of times i don't have the option of staying home without you know i just can't you know there's something going on that day or you know that i have to be there for
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i know a lot of um what i do like though is i see a lot of men taking off and they take turns with their wives
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good
 	
 	
 		you know staying home with the kids but that's still you know kids are sick a lot
 	
 	
 		i know it's real i don't have kids yet but it's tough
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		what kind of uh
 		how many vacation days do you get a year
 	
 	
 		well  i get three weeks
 	
 	
 		that's great for how many years you been have you worked there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i got that when i started because i was because i'm an officer of the company
 	
 	
 		oh wow that's great
 	
 	
 		so it depends on if you're an if you're not an officer it depends on how long you've been there i think you get like a week your first year and then two weeks and then you have to be there like five years to get three weeks or four years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then officers just start out at three weeks and then they go up to four weeks
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		depending on i'm real happy with the vacation i guess you know you could take vacation days if you had to stay home but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		TI isn't doing very well so like i'm i'm negative vacation because i've only worked there three years and i i get five days every six months well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		every about two three months we shut down for a week because you know there's no demand for our product so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		i've heard of companies that do that
 	
 	
 		yeah and so we've shut down six weeks a year whereas we used to only shut down two
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and so it's kind of hurt
 	
 	
 		yeah and you have to use your vacation pay for that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and luckily my boss has maybe you know allowed me to work it off but a lot of people you know go in the hole and uh take you know weeks without pay and it's tough
 	
 	
 		oh can you collect unemployment
 	
 	
 		um i don't ever but the people that work for me do yeah
 	
 	
 		do they
 	
 	
 		i mainly the reason because i'm salary so i don't ever lose pay i mean i just go in debt for vacation so yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		well that's yeah that's not not very good are you satisfied with your insurance
 	
 	
 		um yeah mainly because i haven't had really had to use it much i mean
 	
 	
 		does your company pay for it or do you pay for it
 	
 	
 		yeah i have to pay for my husband which is kind of expensive for him i mean it's like
 	
 	
 		do you have flexible benefits where you can get sort of like pick and choose
 	
 	
 		sort sort of yeah um the reason why i don't know much is because i don't real uh i haven't really had to use like my medical i know they increased the deductible last year which kind of hurt
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i don't know and after that they pay like eighty percent and the dentals the dental covers quite a bit but like i said i've never really been sick or anything so i've never had to use it
 	
 	
 		well i think our our insurance we have to pay for part of it and the company pays for part of it but
 		it's expensive but i don't think it's out of line with what other company you know with what other companies do it's just that in general it's it's expensive
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and you know i don't i don't like it do you have uh um four O one K
 	
 	
 		is that like match savings
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it's fifty percent matched
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		how
 	
 	
 		some companies i know are a hundred percent matched yeah like Harris Semiconductors in Florida
 	
 	
 		really
 		where are where
 		for a new job
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		ours will only match twenty five yeah for up to ten percent of your salary
 	
 	
 		really
 		ours is only up to four percent though
 	
 	
 		oh okay well then i guess that's makes a difference
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because i mean i only put in like a real small amount because it's four percent you know after after after that you put it in and you get like interest interest i mean i've saved quite a bit it's helped me a lot but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		you have to roll it over to an IRA if you ever quit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know that's still a good deal
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm glad that we that we have that um the company that i worked for before NCNB was just they were just starting it and uh i think that's i think that's great
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah it teaches people to think of the future i think
 	
 	
 		well yeah because retirement plans now are so bad i don't know about your company but our company tries to keep base salaries low and they compensate employees more with bonuses
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and incentive pay rather than raises because it cuts down on their expenses for the pension plan because your pension's going to be based on what your salary was
 		not what your salary plus bonuses where and your your bonuses cut ultimately end up being fifty percent of your salary
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's kind of a rip
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but more and more companies are going to that now
 	
 	
 		huh
 		TI didn't even give raises this year so
 	
 	
 		at all
 	
 	
 		no they gave uh a few bonuses but for the most part no nobody in TI got raises
 	
 	
 		really
 		gosh that's pretty bad especially with you know inflation and i i've noticed that the cost of living i've lived in Dallas now for three years and the cost of living has just gone up incredibly in that three years that i've been here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah your housing housing mostly i guess is where i notice it
 		but you know in in you know kids kid's get more expensive as they
 	
 	
 		um
