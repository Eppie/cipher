 
     		
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		have you ever been drug tested
 	
 	
 		um
 		that's a good question um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i had a job i had to go get a blood test for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and they and they did a full blood screen
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		on me but they didn't call that a drug test so that i think they checked for drugs they just don't  tell you they did
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i had i've had uh two or three drug tests that i had to get before i could start working at a job
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh different jobs i had one at TI and then one at another engineering company and
 		really i mean i don't mind them i don't do drugs anyway i guess if i did maybe i would but
 		um i don't know i know a girl that she's a nurse and they get drug tested randomly i've never been randomly drug tested
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess so
 		do you think that it's right
 	
 	
 		well uh uh i i come from kind of a biased opinion because i'm a a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i've done employee assistant work and
 		i i know the the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that are specifically drug and alcohol related and it's like in the billions of dollars every year
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um and the the only way that they can prevent that is is you know making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and you know the the problem in the work place is that that people are
 		like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever i mean you can come to come to work drunk and get in an accident and he'll cover up for you and nobody knows about it but could you know ends up costing the company lots and lots of money
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 		you know there
 	
 	
 		i believe it's right especially for certain jobs
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that i think they should be randomly drug tested i believe full force in that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know that i believe every secretary in every company needs to be
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		you know secretaries aren't aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something so
 		i don't know i i'm kind of biased too because i don't do drugs and so i really don't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me because i have nothing to worry about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i guess that's kind of biased
 	
 	
 		yeah well and it's i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job
 	
 	
 		yeah it does
 	
 	
 		if somebody else is impaired because  generally you know it um you find out one way or another
 		if somebody's got a problem on the job
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and if even even if like you say even if it's just the secretary if her work or abilities start affecting her coworkers then it it's still a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		but what do you do about the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before and you know it's it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything and they happen to be tested Monday morning
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they could be fired for that
 		you know that that's kind of unfair also
 	
 	
 		well yeah i guess it comes with the turf
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so i guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences
 	
 	
 		yeah and then you're
 		in in in terms of
 		drugs they're illegal so you're
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		you're breaking the law anyway
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		um probably the the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and that's probably the biggest problem there is
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so more than drugs
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and i know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they would pay for an alcohol but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i guess that's one of the positive things that has has come out of it some of the employee assistance program if you do test positive for something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they will give you an opportunity opportunity opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and i think
 	
 	
 		i think that's fair
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think the benefits the company benefits in the long run
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 		that's about all i have to say on it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what what kind of testing do they do when you went
 	
 	
 		uh it's a urine test and they uh
 	
 	
 		urine screen yeah
 	
 	
 		it was really very official you have to go in a room solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you have to fill the bottle yourself and label it yourself and all of that so that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's i guess or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that happens
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i can't it's hard to believe but i guess it does
 	
 	
 		it happens a lot
 		there there are people that know pay other people for that
 	
 	
 		i know i'm amazed at the things people will do
 	
 	
 		to help them out
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it is amazing i guess there are people that do that and they are those are expensive tests i'm glad i never had to pay for one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it depends really really really on how how strong a test it is they've got different degrees as far as as how far back they can check
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so
 	
 	
 		they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests they've they've got some companies that are doing um hair tests
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah well that they'll pull out one of your hairs and they can apparently test
 		um
 		back a certain period of time
 	
 	
 		how weird i didn't know  that
 	
 	
 		um because um some of the the residue ends up in your hair follicles you know it's kind of
 	
 	
 		oh that's weird
 	
 	
 		hair follicles i guess are just dead protein and they
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it it's apparently almost almost like a a calendar they they've got it
 		pretty precise now that they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and and that type of thing
 	
 	
 		that's wild
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		it's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i guess if they perfect that and then it's not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		
 
 		that's true i'm glad i never had to do that by giving blood  i can't stand the thought of giving blood
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i can't even do it for Wadley even though it's a good cause
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		well i did too
 	
 	
 		thank you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh bye bye
 	
 	
 		bye bye
