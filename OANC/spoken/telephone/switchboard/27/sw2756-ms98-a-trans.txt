 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so we've been out there a couple of times and um i uh went to Purdue for a couple of years so i've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		uh
 		i'm a real big baseball fan so i usually try to combine it with uh catching a couple of games somewhere
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  what club do you follow
 	
 	
 		i'm uh i'm a big Red Sox fan but uh i uh oh you're you're a Red Sox fan too
 	
 	
 		red sounds good me too
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i usually try to catch whoever's in town though i don't specifically i you know go to Cleveland to see them play the Red the Indians play the Red Sox
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh that's about it we don't i mean we do a lot of little trips around here um and um
 	
 	
 		ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains or
 	
 	
 		not that much we've gone out to um uh a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		have you ever heard of it
 	
 	
 		i've heard of it i've never been there
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's really neat it's this house built on on a waterfall and it's uh really cool  um of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there uh the first time we went out there was uh the day after hurricane Hugo had come through
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		so i mean they they didn't have any power and it was really cold and and rainy and uh we went up about a year later and it was better but not a whole lot better
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um where else did we go um
 		we've gone to Richland last year and uh had a good time down there
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 		did you go down to Williamsburg have you been down there
 	
 	
 		um my girlfriend has with her sisters but i haven't been down there um i hear that's nice we're going to get down probably down Norfork sometime this Summer just to see why catch a baseball game actually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we were down well when we came back from the outer banks we came up due Norfork and spent a night there with a friend in Portsmith and then went to Williamsburg and spent a night
 	
 	
 		hum spend a day and a lot of money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard uh i'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the of the price attached to it we just we i
 	
 	
 		yeah but it's a pretty neat town to just go and walk around if you like to walk it's a good town to just walk in
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah we all do that
 	
 	
 		you can go to the buildings and not go in if you're not
 	
 	
 		oh okay so i can wander around without
 	
 	
 		yeah you can wander it's a good town to wander in
 	
 	
 		oh okay i just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		oh okay i didn't know that yeah i think um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know they do the whole with you know paying a ridiculous amount of money to get  get into one thing or another but they had a good time so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		we didn't do that really this time we just
 		uh visited around
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		we've done it a couple of times and that's enough for us  probably another twenty years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i was um we use it live in California and um my um up up around San Francisco and um there was one year when my father was uh
 		my father's company was starting to to do stuff down in Los Angeles so my father was working down in Los Angeles for like um six months or so
 		um actually i think it was closer i think to a full year and you know we'd he'd fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays well any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i saw i went to Disneyland about five times in one year and i really have no great urge to go back now
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's great as a kid though isn't it i mean
 	
 	
 		oh it was great because uh well the times that were really fun were when uh we had vacation but the kids in Los Angeles didn't so we basically had run of the park um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		Disneyland i mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland but there was another um  another amusement park down there Busch Gardens um there was nobody there when we were there we got we won a log floating ride like five straight times we just get get done with them and they go oh do you want to go again and we'd say sure
