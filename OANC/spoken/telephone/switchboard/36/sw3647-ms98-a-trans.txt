 
     		
 	
 		Brian in Plano Texas how are you doing today
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hi fine i'm Nancy how are you
 	
 	
 		great Nancy
 	
 	
 		i'm in Plano also  yes we're not too long distance today
 	
 	
 		you're in Plano also uh
 		
 
 		well good to hear i was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		oh that was good Utah i've had a couple of but that was it
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		all right well good to hear good to hear
 	
 	
 		
 
 		learned about their basketball team
 	
 	
 		
 
 		which one
 	
 	
 		uh Jazz
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the Utah Jazz
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're pretty good they got some
 	
 	
 		that's what i heard yeah
 	
 	
 		good  good some good uh good players out there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well you ready for New Year's Eve
 	
 	
 		i am
 	
 	
 		good should we uh start this so we can what was your name again Nancy that's right and i'm Brian just a moment
 	
 	
 		okay
 		Nancy
 		right right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay Nancy the i guess the today's subject is benefits in a job other than salary what uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as as crucial benefits
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		well i'm a little different than other people because i don't have benefits with my job
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm a nurse and i work i float
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that i have no benefits except higher pay for doing that
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance and i i make enough money by the hour to make up for that
 	
 	
 		to to compensate for some of the benefits oh
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh yeah it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and then i have my freedom i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do
 	
 	
 		well that's that's an excellent so actually that is a benefit uh
 	
 	
 		well it is to me most people prefer the security of nine to five and weekends off and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement and i'm just
 		really not interested in all that
 	
 	
 		right right
 		well i guess that's a good point uh i do belong to a a large corporation or my that where i'm currently employed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there's uh there's some different things uh one that you've already mentioned is is health insurance i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a through a group plan
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasn't employed with a large corporation
 		and that got to be somewhat expensive and so i i think one of the benefits i i see is the uh is the group uh group discount
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right and especially if you have a family then i think it makes a big difference
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and yes and that's that's one thing i do have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if i didn't have a family i don't think i would have as as a male or as a as an individual of in this stage of my life i don't think i would have insurance uh other
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't think i would go through that expense one other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job i really enjoyed because they had what was called a flex schedule
 		where i could go and i could work uh nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours or i could do uh work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a four you know three week day weekend
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and make uh make my job flexible in that case
 	
 	
 		could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week
 	
 	
 		well basically yeah i had to do that uh the same uh for about every quarter of the year i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh because i was in a in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that uh i needed to make my schedule uh
 		so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i i think that uh that was a that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed and i don't currently have that in my current operation but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you mentioned uh flexible work schedule and that's that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh what other benefits do you think are important
 	
 	
 		oh well i guess retirement that kind of thing which i don't worry much about so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i just prefer to worry about today and probably not a practical attitude but that's who i am so
 	
 	
 		well and that's an individual thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah with uh with our current uh organization we do have a nice retirement package and also a a nice thing that that we have in our corporation is a uh is a profit sharing plan
 		where we can uh participate in the the profits of the company if we're you know if we've been there a while and we're vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the company that we can
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times
 		and uh also uh in one of my wife's uh companies where she worked they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that that effectively they made a certain
