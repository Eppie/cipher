 
     		
 	
 		he likes them
 	
 	
 		well uh the most i've done so far is like uh landscaping you know bushes and shrubs and stuff like that my wife likes to put out flowers and stuff in the flower beds  so i'm always having to uh turn the flower beds for her every year
 		she puts the flowers and i try to maintain the bushes and trees and stuff
 	
 	
 		well i do vegetable gardening i rent a rotortiller once a year in January and
 		turn everything and then i start putting stuff in in third week in January and there's stuff pretty much out there until the freeze hits whenever that is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i usually start off with onions and garlic and then i put in beets
 	
 	
 		hm
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then uh put out
 	
 	
 		green beans
 	
 	
 		red red red beets but you can eat the tops too
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and then i usually put out um some kind of spinach or some type of green like that and then in April is when the tomatoes and peppers and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		lima beans and black eyed peas and cucumbers and all that other good stuff goes out
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh each year i try something i've never tried before this year i'm trying a product called well it's called spaghetti basically it's a squash like product when you cook it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i've heard of that
 	
 	
 		when you yeah i've never tried that before each year i try something new and so this is the one i'm gonna try see if it works down here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but my wife has rose bushes and she takes care of those
 	
 	
 		uh i see i'd like to do a vegetable garden but i don't have the yard size for it i'm in a zero lot line home but uh we're thinking of moving this year the interest rates are getting so low we can't afford not to
 	
 	
 		well you know the vegetable gardens don't have to be very big this plot i have is twenty two by eight so that's a hundred and seventy six square feet which is not very big and
 		you know if you have crops in the early spring and then crops in the summer and crops in the fall on the same spot you can put a minimum of two different crops like where i have um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um onions and garlic sometimes i'll put other things you know because the onions and garlics will mature in June or July
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so how do your tomatoes tomatoes do down here pretty good
 	
 	
 		oh they do real well i used the type called Better Boy
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		for several years which did well but it has not done well the last couple years so in this past year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i tried a new crop called Celebrity
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and Celebrity gave me pretty much continuous  tomatoes from the um first week in June until the freeze hit in November
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		course i think a lot of it was due to the mild weather and the rain but i had tomatoes on the table every day for five months which is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		in the in the past i usually got tomatoes for three four weeks and that would be it and then in the fall i'd you know get a couple more weeks but this is a very unusual year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh you try fruit like uh strawberries and
 	
 	
 		well we did have strawberries a few years ago but we don't do them anymore and we had a peach tree and it was too much hassle you have to spray it and uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		cover the fruit from the birds and all these other things and it just proved to be more hassle than it was worth
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah so vegetables are much easier then
 	
 	
 		vegetables are pretty easy i think fruit is has some difficulties of course any  some vegetables are far more work than others the hard part is at the very beginning when you have to
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		set up the garden and get everything but once the plants get going and then it's just a matter of keeping the insects off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well that sounds neat you ever do anything like melons
 	
 	
 		no never done that
 	
 	
 		no i remember one year at my parents' old house we grew a um
 		i guess a pumpkin a squash plant you know turned out to be a pumpkin and uh it it bore pretty good size fruit and then one year we just let one of the squashes grow out it produced a really huge pumpkin
 		we're pretty surprised and they just got lucky because they didn't do anything to it no fertilizing or anything just kind of threw the seeds out there
 		but uh looks pretty neat yeah this was down in San Antonio so i don't know
 	
 	
 		hm that's strange well you must've gotten lucky
 		well the climate's a little better for that down there for hot weather
 	
 	
 		i think so too i think so too i you know i noticed here in Dallas well maybe it depends on where you live but it's like the shrubs don't do as well they don't grow as fast
 	
 	
 		well that's sometimes you have hot cold winters but we haven't had anything so far this year
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i've got a tree that i planted that doesn't it's okay but it doesn't you know my dad planted a tree two years after i planted mine and his is like three times as big as mine
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		i don't know what it is i I think it is uh i have a feeling that the soil's not there's a lot of rocks in it
 	
 	
 		must be the soil
 	
 	
 		because all around me i can see where the erosion is from from the creek beds there's a lot of rock under me i have a feeling i'm i'm probably the roots are probably hitting rocks or something
 	
 	
 		um it's hard for them to go once they have no dirt there
 	
 	
 		yeah i try to keep it going but it's not getting very big i think in five years it grew like three or four feet
 	
 	
 		maybe you need a
 	
 	
 		i know i
