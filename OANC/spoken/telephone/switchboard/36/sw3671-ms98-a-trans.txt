 
     		
 	
 		what kind of a house do you live in is it typical of the area
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the uh house i live in is fairly typical of the area it's one that uh my wife and i designed ourselves
 	
 	
 		how neat
 	
 	
 		and we've been living in it now for thirty years so it must be okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh we moved into our home about thirty three years ago
 		and at the time it was a small ranch style it had two bedrooms on the main floor and then the basement wasn't finished but we have since finished the basement we've added a car port and we've added a big family room
 	
 	
 		well in Texas we don't have basements very often i'm surprised you do in Utah
 	
 	
 		oh most most i would think most of the homes in Utah do
 		we live uh up against up by the mountains
 	
 	
 		so it's cold
 	
 	
 		yes we got about uh three inches of snow last night the snow plows have been out and my husband's been out shoveling the snow
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		so uh but ours is is typical for the neighborhood but
 	
 	
 		it is it air-conditioned
 	
 	
 		no i have arthritis
 	
 	
 		so you're cool enough you don't need the air-conditioning
 	
 	
 		no in the summer time for about oh a month we could use air-conditioning but i have arthritis and i don't i don't like air-conditioning
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but we
 	
 	
 		well in Texas you can't hardly live without it
 	
 	
 		i know i've been to my son's in August and i hated it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah we designed our house so the western exposure has a minimum number of windows so that the air-conditioning bill will be cheaper
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh we had uh we have had six children
 		and so our house was small to start with but uh we added three basement three bedrooms in the basement and like i say added on to it so
 		uh it's pretty typical did you have help designing it or was that part of what you do
 	
 	
 		no actually uh it we we just started and we didn't like any of the houses we saw uh built they tended to have at the time we were building
 		very large uh bathrooms which i consider a waste of space since you spend so little time in the bathroom
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh also too much hall uh space we saw a home plan in Better Homes and Gardens about five years before we built this house that we liked
 		except uh we wanted it a little bigger than uh uh it had two bedrooms that you could add on another bedroom
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we wanted it arranged slightly differently
 		i think if you looked at the floor plan now uh you probably wouldn't recognize where we started from
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's kind of the way ours is too
 	
 	
 		but uh my wife likes a lot of cabinets in the kitchen and the original architect tried to talk us out of that and thank goodness we didn't let him talk us out of that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we wanted an entry way so that the living room
 		did not have to be walked through
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the previous place we had lived in you always walked through the living room to get any place in the house and it was a traffic flow problem all the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we have an entry way and i uh spend quite a little time in uh both when i was working and also even now retired
 		in the study where i have a computer so we wanted a separate study and we have that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it has uh three bedrooms and we wanted it since our son we raised my wife's sister as our daughter so in effect we had two children but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we wanted it so that we could leave the house to them uh when they had friends over and the normal noise that goes with such things so we have the
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		master bedroom is arranged so that it is basically basically a separate apartment in itself it has its own bath has its own patio porch type thing sliding doors and a very large room with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a TV set so you could live back there by itself if you wanted to uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh that sounds lovely
 		i've always wanted uh another bedroom upstairs and then i we've never had a bathroom off the master bedroom and i would like that
 	
 	
 		oh that's i don't know uh with our previous house didn't have it and uh
 		now that we've got it we we think we couldn't live without it you know
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well those are two things that i would definitely i would add another bedroom on the main floor i quilt a lot but
 	
 	
 		yeah my wife does also
 	
 	
 		oh does she
 	
 	
 		yeah and now with the kids gone well she has a room reserved for her junk and i have one for my junk you know
 	
 	
 		well that would be the way to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but like i say our children live a long way away and so our family room i quilt in there a lot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's big enough that uh we it was eighteen by twenty when we added it on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so uh it's big enough for that but
