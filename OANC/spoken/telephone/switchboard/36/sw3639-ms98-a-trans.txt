 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh are you presently looking uh for a used used car
 	
 	
 		well as a matter of fact i just bought one  just just within the last three weeks
 	
 	
 		just bought one
 		so what'd you get
 	
 	
 		i got a Lexus LS four hundred
 	
 	
 		Lexus um
 	
 	
 		which is made by Toyota
 	
 	
 		okay Lexus is a Toyota sub brand
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay i was wondering where that came from because they're talking like it was an American built car
 	
 	
 		it's kind of their
 		right it it sounds like it but it really isn't  it's uh marketed of course it its own dealerships
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		usually usually or somebody that's maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus dealership uh sometimes they do that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's uh a brand car but i've really liked it it it drives just wonderfully and there is it's so quiet you almost can't tell the engine is running
 	
 	
 		that's their big selling point uh other than general luxury and and but the particular seems to be the uh the quiet ride
 		it seems they it's
 	
 	
 		it really is it's got pretty good acceleration too it's got a CD player in it so i can i can play those and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh was that wasn't a standard  feature was it
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but there's not very many options on that car
 	
 	
 		uh i get the impression
 	
 	
 		there's only about five or six options everything else is standard uh some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north the CD and the premium sound system
 	
 	
 		yeah you get the impression that's
 		um-hum
 		yeah skidding control you mean the antilock brake system
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of a traction control i think they call it it's it's not just antilock brake i think that's already on most of them but there's a further traction control uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh this is a uh
 		uh probably suspension tied into the brakes
 	
 	
 		yeah and and also the suspension can be raised for driving like in the ice and snow it can raise the car's center up a little bit
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		for going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in Michigan or somewhere
 	
 	
 		yeah uh shoot  some of these muddy driveways use it around here
 	
 	
 		Mississippi probably doesn't
 		Mississippi probably doesn't have to worry too much about that
 	
 	
 		no snow doesn't happen very often
 	
 	
 		if it does people go what's this stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah uh originally i'm from West Virginia we got a pretty fair amount of snow but uh i got down here in June of eighty four
 	
 	
 		oh well you had some there yeah
 	
 	
 		and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen in twenty years
 		and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane manly adult men into playful little children
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		we had this group of uh surveyors come into uh a shop i was working in
 		um four or five of them these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place
 		they had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked but while they were there they set back  drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place
 	
 	

 		oh no
 		
 
 	
 	
 		had themselves a ball for about an hour
 	
 	
 		well the uh
 		the Lexus uh really and the moon roof i think is also an option although most of them are ordered them with it but there really is only about a half a dozen uh things and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		everything else is pretty standard i did not get the traction control which also when you take the control traction control and the  and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats too
 	
 	
 		oh so that's kind of
 	
 	
 		you go out and get in that real cold car and you turn that on and it yeah and it kind of uh but that's only available if with the traction control and the other option and those two are sold together so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to
 	
 	
 		it's a package deal
 		yeah
 		ouch
 	
 	
 		to uh do it so i i opted not for that but
 	
 	
 		no it doesn't sound real necessary in Texas
 	
 	
 		and uh the dealership i dealt with they order them all with the uh moon roof and uh you know nice floor mats and everything in there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i worked for Lincoln
 	
 	
 		so the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a CD or not in the stereo system and that was pretty much it and they had like three or four basic packages that they
 	
 	
 		yeah sounds like the Lincoln Mercury dealer i used to work for they didn't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got little Mercury Tracer
 	
 	
 		they offer
 		yeah i've been over i've been
 	
 	
 		imagine or not they make a they make a luxury Mercury Tracer
 	
 	
 		yeah i've seen that in the dealership i was driving a Lincoln a Mark Seven for the last four years before i traded it for this and uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i'm leasing the Lexus i usually lease them since i own a business i just run it through my business but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it the Lincoln ride is certainly good too but the this Lexus is nothing like i have ever been in before it just
 	
 	
 		like sitting in your living room
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is and it's got a lumbar support in the seats adjustable uh power and just kind of brings that support up in the small
 	
 	
 		adjustable
 		yeah
