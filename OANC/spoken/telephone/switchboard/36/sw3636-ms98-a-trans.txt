 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well so far my wife and i have pretty much had to stick with tent camping
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		this summer we went to uh the Smokey Mountain National Park
 	
 	
 		oh how great
 	
 	
 		and uh stayed about three or four days in there
 		it was wonderful nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable and the the days were nice and warm and it was beautiful beautiful few days
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um
 		uh-huh that's great
 	
 	
 		it worked out particularly well especially considering she was what six months pregnant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know it worked pretty well it was one of those uh those dome type pop up tents
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		nice and quick and easy to put up and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		packs away nice and small
 		yeah about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto
 	
 	
 		well that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		it was a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess the last real uh camping trip i took was has been a couple years ago
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i went to California and up to the Sequoias
 	
 	
 		ah that's got to be beautiful territory
 	
 	
 		yeah it's gorgeous i love the big trees
 		just just the drive up through um up the coast line and then cut over in into the into the parks it's gorgeous though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what like Sequoia National Park yeah uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum yeah i had been there before when i lived in California that's my first trip back in oh goodness hm hm thirty years maybe  but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that is God's country it has to be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		do they still have the uh the scenic uh roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees
 	
 	
 		uh no no they don't that and the last one um and well the first time i was there the the tree was still standing but it has since come down
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah but they are huge if you've never seen them it's it's very awe inspiring
 	
 	
 		no so far New Orleans is far west as i've gotten
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		well New Orleans and uh Minneapolis
 	
 	
 		um-hum well there's lots of pretty country further west
 	
 	
 		oh yeah we're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah and needed need to take the little one
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		show them all the all the pretties before they go away
 	
 	
 		yeah they seem to be trailing out quickly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah  because of there there's lots to see  there's of course the  the Grand Canyon and uh the Painted Desert is is real pretty in a in a different sort of way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and course the the Sequoias and the Redwoods and and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone and uh the Grand Tetons are gorgeous too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i imagine
 	
 	
 		yeah course i'm i guess i'm partial to big tree country
 	
 	
 		i would imagine they are
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know why i got stuck down here in Texas  i think it's called a job i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh not a whole lot of forestry down there is there
 	
 	
 		no not around here not around here  hm
 	
 	
 		oh
 		the place is forested with concrete with those concrete trees
 	
 	
 		um-hum lot lot of concrete and glass you know hm
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i guess that's God's place too
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping
 	
 	
 		uh  probably the the last one that i went to California i took uh three weeks
