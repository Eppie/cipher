 
     		
 	
 		will i return anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well really the only things that i have returned have not been faulty it's been because of the size or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		some problem like that i really haven't had to return things because they didn't perform the way they were supposed to
 	
 	
 		most the time they have a pretty good guarantee uh only thing i've had lately is uh
 		my kids got all these Barbie
 		kind of toys for uh Christmas and uh
 		it it takes them less than a day and they're broken in one way or another but i don't know if that's just kids or if that's uh
 		maybe those type of parts should should be for older kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum what age are your children
 	
 	
 		i have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i don't think they're unduly rough but maybe they are i don't know but uh a lot of the little Barbie sets they come with real  little pieces
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		and they're easily lost and easily broken but
 	
 	
 		um-hum  well my daughter  is twenty one now so it's been a while since we've had Barbie things
 	
 	
 		but you know
 		it's been a while since they've uh gone through the Barbie stage doll stage huh
 	
 	
 		but we did have Barbies we did have Barbies and things and there seems to me that that became a craze when she was already oh like you know third fourth fifth grade
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it but uh i don't remember her breaking a lot of stuff
 	
 	
 		don't remember her breaking the
 	
 	
 		no i don't but i also don't remember lots of little pieces they've got so many different things with it now
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's one thing they've got they've got every type of imaginable camping on the beach and all of these come with
 		oh like little tiny tiny little plates and little sunglasses and uh my three and a half year old has wanted this
 	
 	
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		Ken doll and so i finally got her a Ken doll and uh
 		less than a week later the arm was broken
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		but they were real good about replacing it that's one nice thing is they're real good about replacing it
 	
 	
 		well uh i guess if they'll replace them then they assume they shouldn't have broken
 	
 	
 		right
 		well the the you know those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way and she's not that strong that i would
 	
 	
 		any direction um um-hum
 	
 	
 		she's not that big of a girl that i think could really  take a grip on it like a bigger kid could you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah the main thing that they've they had when my daughter was playing with Barbies was just clothes you know that was about it
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that was about it and the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that kind of stuff but
 	
 	
 		and the main thing my kids are seem to be into nowadays are electronics
 		my my children are twenty one and twenty five and twenty eight
 	
 	
 		oh is that right well do you see that there's a little big problem with electronic things
 	
 	
 		um-hum and so
 		no not really we uh haven't had that much you know problem with things that we have bought they seem to to last in fact when they offer us extended warranties we we don't buy them because we've
 	
 	
 		don't buy them because you don't need them
 	
 	
 		we don't we find we don't need them and uh it seems like it's just a an added tack on plus a lot of their credit cards now you know will guarantee
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		if you purchase on your credit card you know then they extended put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work and and uh or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time so it seems like it's a waste of money
 	
 	
 		oh yes that's the way
 		yes
 		well you almost assume if you're gonna have problems with it it's usually before before that warranty would expire any the first one
 	
 	
 		um-hum and like i've even bought on a recliner once i bought you know a a an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that and i never used it
 	
 	
 		you never never even needed it
 	
 	
 		and so they it seems ridiculous and like  washers and dryers and things like that i've never had one go out in fact they usually
 		when they do go out it's either something my husband can buy the part and fix and we don't even have a repairman come or it means it's old enough that it's time to replace the whole thing um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's time to replace it
 		yes i i think these extended warranties are gimmicks really
 	
 	
 		so i mean they're
 		i do too
 	
 	
 		a lot of it we bought when we first married we bought one on our TV
 		and that there was it was a five year after the first five years and that was ridiculous
 	
 	
 		um-hum and they charge you a pretty good price for them too
 	
 	
 		yes they're a pretty healthy price and you're trying to think oh maybe i'll need this you never
 		you always think gosh if i say no then i won't you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well my husband finally just put his foot down and he said we're not gonna buy any of these anymore and if it goes out well you know
 	
 	
 		i don't know if
 		you probably got your time worth out of it anyway
 	
 	
 		um-hum and uh so uh we really have been fairly happy with with things but now we take good care of things and we don't um
 		run out and buy a lot of of things either and since our kids aren't little anymore i'm not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken
 	
 	
 		yes the little well you probably are real careful of the brands you buy and the
 		when you do buy things you probably watch what kind of type of quality yes
 	
 	
 		well you look at the consumer guide and uh you go around and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the
