 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay it's what movies have you seen lately and which
 	
 	
 		well uh we just saw JFK uh like yesterday
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 	
 	
 		did you like it
 	
 	
 		yeah um i'm a big Oliver Stone fan i mean so anything he does i mean i like but yeah have you seen it yet
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		i mean you know it's just about the assassination and everything so
 	
 	
 		is it just more or less the things that we've seen and heard before
 	
 	
 		well what some of you have heard some of you haven't i think it's just it's it's pretty much every
 		it's the most plausible theory that i guess um theories that they kind of pulled together in kind of a um
 		pretty much an order pretty much i don't know it's kind of hard to describe i mean it's kind uh you have to kind of see it because it wasn't what i expected because i was thinking it's going to be just kind of a typical rundown of what you know you've heard the past you know ten years but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it's a great movie because uh you leave the uh movie thinking that you know the government actually was
 	
 	
 		involved in it
 	
 	
 		they they yeah i mean they you know they did there's always that cover up and that was in sixty you know sixty three so i mean uh twenty eight years later there's been
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's so much more that they've done i mean that screw the American people around so it's it's a great movie
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my family's in actually my family's here tonight um and they're wanting to see it so i'm probably going to go see it again and i'm not one i usually don't like to see a movie you know twice but if it's
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		gee that's a three hour and like twenty minute movie and i mean i want to see it again it's a great movie
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's really good
 	
 	
 		oh well we we uh most of our movies are we rent them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh my husband and i are the only ones left home so we just rent the movies and the last one we saw was Home Alone
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i just loved it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a good movie i saw that last year
 	
 	
 		yeah well my my even my grandchildren like it
 	
 	
 		when it came out
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it it's been a good movie and we've we've really uh we've in fact we bought the video
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh is there any others that you especially stand out that you like
 	
 	
 		yeah i've seen uh
 		saw Bugsy and uh
 	
 	
 		oh was that good
 	
 	
 		that's a good movie yeah
 	
 	
 		that was on the the racketeers wasn't it
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		that was on the racketeering
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's um
 	
 	
 		and the twenties
 	
 	
 		right it's about uh Bugsy Siegel who pretty much started Flamingo out in Vegas he had like the vision of you know Vegas what it could be what it is today
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		at the time it was you know just a complete desert and
 		pretty much
 	
 	
 		they built it on a
 	
 	
 		yeah he had he was given a budget of like a million dollars to go out and build this Flamingo
 		and they thought he was crazy it was a stupid idea and you know he built it but it cost like six million dollars because he had so many overruns and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean there was nothing out there and they thought you know it was stupid so he got killed for it because you know he
 	
 	
 		he never did live to see the
 	
 	
 		right and you know the the great thing is you know his six million dollar investment turned out to be a two hundred billion dollar return so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they killed him because they didn't think it was going to work out but it's a great movie it's a good movie Warren Beatty did a good job and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i've seen uh God what else
 		oh
 		i'm trying to think
 	
 	
 		do you go to a lot of movies
 	
 	
 		uh lately i've just seen this past week or so because
 		i'm uh i had a couple past couple weeks off so i saw couple of movies we just saw Bugsy and JFK like in a two day period so that was one thing and
 		i can't think of anything else i've seen lately i mean i i i'm a big movie fan so i mean i usually rent them too but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well we we really
 	
 	
 		Cape Fear that was another movie i saw Cape Fear is real good
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh have you seen that one you've see a lot of the latest ones haven't you
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a great movie
 		yeah i'm a big Martin  fan so
 	
 	
 		oh did you see uh Beauty and the Beast
 	
 	
 		no i hadn't seen that yet but uh i'm probably i guess i probably i probably will these at first you know you think of animation as a cartoon that's kind of a kid film but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the more i've heard i'm might have had a couple of friends actually saw it and says it's a pretty good film but
 		um i you know i'll probably get around to seeing it
 	
 	
 		do you have children
 	
 	
 		no i'm i'm twenty three but i got a girl friend she's big time
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		she's been begging me to go you know i want to Beauty and the Beast so
