 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um the one that i'm most familiar with are the Utah Jazz i guess that's because they they're Utah Jazz
 	
 	
 		what are they called
 		Jazz oh never heard of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the Jazz right and  they're a fairly new ball team as far as ball teams go  um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they probably oh it's probably five to ten years that they've they've been
 		you know in existence and but they've done really fairly well for for a new team they i think out of the last like eleven games they've won
 		won nine which is pretty good because a lot of them were on you know on the road and um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i think as far as whichever division they're in they're rated either number one or number two so that's yeah that's fairly good and how about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that's good
 		yeah well maybe we'll hear of them more often
 	
 	
 		yeah and how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well i guess what we have here is the Mavericks is that right basketball what is
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		what is our Dallas basketball i'm not really sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the Dallas Mavericks i that
 	
 	
 		one is soccer one is basketball the Mavericks must be basketball
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh my daughter plays basketball you wouldn't know it would you from this conversation i'm familiar with the Teddy Bears and they're my favorite
 	
 	
 		oh well well tell me about yeah tell me about her team how old is she
 	
 	
 		well now she's twelve so she but she's been playing basketball for four or five years on a little team called Teddy Bears and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh has she
 		well how fun
 	
 	
 		that's been fun so now she just made her middle school team so that's
 	
 	
 		well great
 	
 	
 		and they've won so far that's good but uh
 	
 	
 		she must really enjoy it
 	
 	
 		yes she likes it a lot yeah she really does and the Lakers i guess is my favorite as far as
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		as anything i know about basketball yeah because i my boyfriend's in California so
 	
 	
 		as professionals professional basketball teams
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm gonna have to look at Lakers this year a lot so i guess i'll get used to it i learned a lot about football  so
 	
 	
 		have to at least
 		oh  uh-huh well does a now was was your daughter just interested in basketball or why did she start playing
 	
 	
 		uh i guess because her friends signed up
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and she wanted to sign up she twirls and she's she's been real real involved in that so we haven't had time for soccer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		which is the most important thing around here pretty i mean all the little kids play soccer
 	
 	
 		oh is it
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they even have like a preschool soccer team
 	
 	
 		my word
 	
 	
 		it's big in Texas and i maybe all over now i don't know but
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		uh it's very big here but we didn't have that time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i did let her play basketball and i like it because it's indoors
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah  i like indoor things so yeah
 	
 	
 		right  well that's good if she made her middle school team she must be fairly fairly proficient
 	
 	
 		yeah well she's pretty fast she's not real big but she's real fast and so um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh oh well yeah it's hard to just for me to picture these little ones that basketball is pretty big to be thrown
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know up that that high
 	
 	
 		yeah but oh in the beginning you know they couldn't even make the basket and they were allowed to stand halfway forward to take that take solid shots and they couldn't even get the ball that high because they were so little and not strong enough
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then uh her last game just before the whistle blew they had two seconds left
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		she threw the ball from center court and it went right into the basket
 	
 	
 		oh wow  well great  oh that's great  now do
 	
 	
 		so she was the hero after all those years of trying to get that ball up in that basket so and so that was pretty fun to see the improvement  and her coach was behind us in the bleachers but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		from the other team and he said  Christmas came early this year  so yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well how fun now do you have any boys that play or
 	
 	
 		no my son never played uh basketball he's he's grown and he he's in the band and he swam some
 	
 	
 		how old is he
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		mostly he was a student  so
 	
 	
 		oh he was he was he was in
 	
 	
 		yeah he's a national merit student and he speaks five languages and all that so he wasn't much into sports he did play baseball for a while and he liked that
 	
 	
 		great oh great
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but um he didn't he didn't play basketball at all
 	
 	
 		well that's fun have you ever played basketball
 	
 	
 		i did i played basketball in high school i loved it that and volleyball
 	
 	
 		that is i've just played it for fun i've never done anything you know organized or on a a school team or anything but i think it's a real fun game
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i love it i think it's my favorite and it's my favorite to watch
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and when i was in high school i was a twirler and so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i always enjoyed that and cheerleading you know we got to do it indoors
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		so i always liked the basketball games better than the football games because you weren't out in the cold so
 	
 	
 		right
 		well it seems like i don't know basketball maybe i don't know that much  but it doesn't seem like basketball's that aggressive compared to football and
 	
 	
 		well yeah and it's easier to follow
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if the ball goes in they get two points football everybody falls on top of each other and it's real difficult to say
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		who  right right that's
 	
 	
 		exactly what went wrong you know for me anyway  so
