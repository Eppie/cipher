 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what i like in a good job is i like good salary but also i think they should have insurance benefits and profit sharing and
 		retirement funds like that so that you can plan for the future and they don't do that any more like they used to in the big companies
 	
 	
 		well i i i agree with what you say and of course uh
 		in addition to what you mentioned uh you know i'd like to see them have some uh have more companies have like dental care
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		medical and dental
 	
 	
 		yeah and more benefits for uh working mothers uh
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i noticed here lately there's some companies have been providing what they kind of call an in-house day care center where the mothers can come and leave their uh children with somebody locally at the company and go to work and if something happens they're immediately there
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		oh wouldn't that be great
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a couple of teenagers i have a couple of daughters uh one of which is married and has two two small sons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they stay in a day care and and they have a lot of sickness because they're around the other children
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and it would be so nice if uh the company she worked for provided that uh you know in house or or nearby or
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		now there is there is one benefit that uh is uh offered now um where they pay
 		they pay they pay for hospitalization
 		uh with funds uh before income tax funds uh before with funds that are not taxed
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i think that's more or less kind of in the group insurance field
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's a new innovation too for a benefit
 	
 	
 		well that in-house day care is excellent they could go on their lunch hour and see their kids or any time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's true
 		and uh let's see what other benefits do you have any others uh that you'd like to see
 		how about uh
 	
 	
 		well i the profit sharing and the retirement they just don't offer those like they used to
 	
 	
 		yeah in the old days of course they didn't have any any benefits at all they preached job security but that that went out fast
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh it didn't that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh so now days i guess funding takes part or rather uh
 		uh your benefits are locked in after you're there with a company for five years but the benefits are so small
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and usually they're tied in with social security
 		and uh it
 	
 	
 		most people retire on social security now that's all they have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right and uh so uh even if you have benefits and you and then when you get to social security age they're not as great because they're tied in to social security benefits so you don't get both of them in full
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's hard today to live off of social security if you don't have your home paid for
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		that's what my folks did they're just living on social security
 		they had  two houses and they were trying to buy sell one to pay off the other one and
 		oh they waited for like four or five years trying to  sell that one house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so they could pay off the other one because they're just living on social security they had a real hard time
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		yeah you got to have your house paid for
 	
 	
 		well you know uh benefits uh
 		are great and uh the more that a company can provide the better off we are but it's so hard now for companies to make a profit as you no doubt uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		know you know most of our companies uh are losing their shirt
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		going bankrupt and uh so some kind of system has to be devised were more  more competitive perhaps we've uh uh
 		been uh we were too used to off time and all these benefits that are not uh taking care of us in our old age but we're getting immediate effect of them like for example like seven hour days and
 		and uh when in effect while we're young we ought to be working harder and come up with better benefits so that when we get older we have the uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we we have those benefits available to us in in a need that would make it easy for us in retirement
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't have to work so hard
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know social security again most of the young people today are paying in they don't have any any they don't believe that anything will be left over
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		when they get to retirement age
 		course the old bank never gets out you know
 	
 	
 		i heard that all my life there wasn't going to be any when i was on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh and uh so uh
 	
 	
 		or when i got on it
 	
 	
 		i guess uh we can make our dollar go lower and lower and lower until you get to zero and then everybody can say okay nobody has anything and start over again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well the insurance that's that's the main thing that i worry about is the insurance
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		insurance costs are going up
 	
 	
 		well and they and they just
