 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah discuss funding for AIDS research um
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh let's see i don't know obviously they're not spending enough now so
 	
 	
 		yeah well i don't know i really am not sure what they're spending on AIDS AIDS research i get the impression it's a pretty sizeable chunk of money
 		i was always uh uh gosh i'm trying to remember where it was but recently
 		uh somebody
 		on the news said that one of the problems with uh AIDS research
 		was that each time they find somebody with you know about every fourth or fifth person they've diagnosed with AIDS has got a new strain
 		it seem to be mutating just like about about like the common cold
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		finding a cure for something like that could be
 		several hundred years in the making
 	
 	
 		yeah um it just depends i mean i think you know they'll probably spend
 		tons of money on it you know  under the AIDS name but it's probably not just being directed in the right channels you know could
 	
 	
 		well  yeah the
 	
 	
 		who knows how much of it's you know it's actually going to that particular study where so so much money gets spent on useless stuff anyways i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah the general
 		yeah the general human
 	
 	
 		on promotional campaigns and you know something like for every dollar that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that they get maybe eighty cents of it goes to you know awareness i mean that's twenty cents only twenty cents for left for actual research and i mean i don't know maybe the Magic Johnson thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i know he's trying put put yeah i just
 	
 	
 		yeah that might help the
 		it might help the awareness part but uh
 	
 	
 		you weren't yet  well i don't know how much he's going to you know actually
 		see i'm just a little skeptical on that because you know first week that you heard all about that you know it was always in the news and now it's kind of just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you hear only time you hear about it now is when he showed up at a Laker game on the sidelines so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't know it you know
 		the uh funding situation seems to be the same for for so many of the major diseases so to speak the uh bulk of the money goes to administrative costs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which usually means high salaries for people running the show and a major name researcher's involved with it you know who knows what actually gets done as far as true research
 		seems
 	
 	
 		exactly um
 		i don't know i just  better do something about it in the next few years it's getting pretty ridiculous uh out of hand i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems everywhere you turn somebody's coming up with it wild part about it nobody seems to want to suggest the idea that doing without is the only safe way of keeping from getting it
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		they figured well you know we all want to be promiscuous so go running all over the place and
 	
 	
 		yeah i still don't know anybody personally that's had it i mean i say i guess once that happens and it you know it's getting close you know that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		no there're there are people who don't get it from promiscuity but there's the sorts who get it through blood transfusions
 	
 	
 		yeah that's just that's something
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the saddest cases of all of
 	
 	
 		that's so unfortunate the innocent bystandard
 	
 	
 		or that woman who died just recently the one who died just recently got it uh from her dentist
 		something like twenty two twenty three years old died of AIDS she got it because her dentist had it and didn't use any precautions
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know but those are the sad cases
 	
 	
 		yeah is um is there big uh what what part of Mississippi do you live in
 	
 	
 		southern Mississippi
 	
 	
 		okay is there um do you all have a lot of um i know i i do know that like down here there's a lot um people complaining that because Dallas they um didn't like hardly give any money for the um
 		AIDS uh programs out here in fact they had to cut back on it you know because the city budget and that was a big there's been a lot of people you know protesting that lately out here and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i didn't know i was just just you know since there something like that gone on down there or
 	
 	
 		um right now as far as the state budget concerning AIDS awareness i'm not even sure that there is i know there isn't any on the city level
 		or on the county level i'm not sure if the state's got much of anything on the AIDS awareness i think most of the AIDS awareness information is more or less coming through private sector
 		um the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i just know that you know that it was just some i mean hundred and forty thousand i think was all that you know for a year's budget that they were providing i mean
 	
 	
 		either that or
 	
 	
 		i mean that'll get you a couple of things but i mean  it just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i don't know i mean
 	
 	
 		course then again most of the people who are protesting the cut in the budget would probably be just as upset if they raised the tax city taxes to cover the costs
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and they're just they had a little um stage thing where they all came in and started lying down on the city
