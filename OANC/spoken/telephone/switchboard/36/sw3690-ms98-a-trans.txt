 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		what what uh what are some of your favorite places to uh eat at
 	
 	
 		uh Royal Tokyo
 	
 	
 		Royal Tokyo uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um Benihana's
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		enchiladas
 	
 	
 		oh all right
 	
 	
 		um
 		and actually Red Lobster  so what about you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well i'm a vegetarian so uh my places are somewhat my my my choices are somewhat limited uh but my very favorite is the Olive Garden i think uh
 		if or or else uh uh El Chico's if i have if i had my choice that's where i like to go
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't been in Dallas for very long and so i don't know you know too many places to eat
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i guess that would be really hard being vegetarian less
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		it it it is a little bit uh you know there are at almost every restaurant there are uh things to eat it's just depends on you know whether whether what you really want to eat is there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i could appreciate that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah are are you a vegetarian also or
 	
 	
 		uh no no i'm i do eat meat um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i guess being brought up that way i do have a tendency though toward chicken and fish seafood
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		um what made you choose to be a vegetarian
 	
 	
 		well uh several reasons um um most most importantly i have a uh uh disease in in both of uh in in all of my joints that uh  in in which arthritis is a big factor
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		and uh  several reports uh in the last five years have given validity to the uh to the to the theory that that uh vegetarian diet diet greatly reduces the pain involved with uh arthritis
 	
 	
 		oh have you found that to be true
 	
 	
 		yeah it really it really does work um  even to the point now where uh i'm able to run you know to go out running or jogging
 		on a a periodic basis which  which was impossible before yeah uh yeah it it it really has helped uh unfortunately um
 	
 	
 		oh well that's great
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i still i i can't give up uh milk
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so so i drink uh i drink skim milk but  if i had my way i'd drink a gallon gallon a day  so but but my my restaurant choices then uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i guess  since i've uh been a vegetarian i've loved fettucini alfredo  and so and so ah but any place i go that has that that's what that's what i eat it doesn't doesn't matter
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		oh well then there's a real good restaurant you should try it's called Rocco's
 	
 	
 		Rocco's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it's off of six thirty five and
 		i believe it's Centerville
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you can see it from six thirty five it's east of Central Expressway
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and it's an Italian place
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they have really really good food nice healthy portions and they're really at reasonably priced
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 		oh good yeah um i'll try that out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's uh yeah my husband matter of fact he works for TI but he and i went there and they have got some of the best bread garlic bread we've ever had and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i think i did have
 		i don't know if it was uh
 		alfredo i might have had the parmigiana
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it was really good
 	
 	
 		yeah what makes you go back to a restaurant
 	
 	
 		um the food first of all yeah um and then service if the if the personnel there are really attentive and if they
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if they really act like they care i mean whether they do or not but if they if they act like they do then those are those are two big things that really make me wanna go back to a restaurant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and what about you
 	
 	
 		uh i i think more than anything else uh the atmosphere
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah ah which i think you know the the service the the service is is a big part of but but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my very favorite place in the world to eat uh believe it or not is in i went to school in Abilene to uh and and there's a place there's a little restaurant there called the Oxford ah the ah Oxford Street  which ah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the food is okay uh uh and uh you know it's it's on the better side of good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the service is okay but the atmosphere is just beautiful it's uh  you you know it looks like an an old English uh home with uh you know the high back leather chairs and uh uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		the cloth the cloth the cloth uh you know how they cloth the walls with with that tapestry cloth it has that it's it's just really nice and i like to eat in there just because i like the feeling in there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh i bet it makes you feel really good
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		makes you hungry
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's um that's pretty good for a restaurant i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah you uh that one one thing i found was interesting is i read a a report when i was a an undergraduate that uh was talking about the colors of a restaurant
