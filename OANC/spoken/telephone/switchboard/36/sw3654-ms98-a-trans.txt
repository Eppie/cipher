 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hi uh how do you feel about gun control
 	
 	
 		oh i don't like a total ban on it
 		but on the other hand i don't like total idiots pulling what they did down in uh my home state of Texas down in uh near Fort Hood
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i think the right of ownership needs to be protected but i don't think there's too much wrong with having it registered and having you think about it a little bit
 	
 	
 		i don't think so either and i think that every gun should be covered cover covered
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		because i think that uh and it doesn't hurt people to have a waiting period
 	
 	
 		well they make us wait to get married in most states i don't
 	
 	
 		yes  right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		unless you want to fly to Las Vegas or so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but i
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		it's just sickening i was on the University of Texas campus when that Chapman climbed the tower and killed twenty two people one of my friends was wounded and he was from
 	
 	
 		kill a
 	
 	
 		La Paz Bolivia and they flew and got his mother here real quick but and a hippie pulled him out of the out of the additional gunshot range so ever since then old Oscar said hippies are okay my buddy
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it was back in the sixties when Vietnam was going on so
 	
 	
 		yes i remember when that happened
 	
 	
 		so i've lived in New York City where they have a uh pistol control and uh
 		big deal you go across the county line into Yonkers and you can buy a pistol and come back into the city
 	
 	
 		so there isn't really a gun control there
 	
 	
 		not really
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well i i think that every gun should be covered from rifles and the automatics and and handguns because people need if they're out after a gun they need a cooling off period
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we have guns in our home but my husband uh used to hunt all my sons hunt
 	
 	
 		um i've got a shotgun and a pistol
 	
 	
 		oh we have
 	
 	
 		and the kids have BBs
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sometimes i think they're about as dangerous but uh
 	
 	
 		well i'd shoot it more often it wasn't against the city ordinance those birds steal my dog's bird dog food my i don't think that's fair
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well we live close to the Wasatch well we live right on the Wasatch front so we're only about well we have  mountains in our backyard and the deer come down and eat our
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh shrubs during the winter
 	
 	
 		do they really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we we had a snow storm the other day and the deer come down and eat the shrubs they keep them trimmed for us
 	
 	
 		we got the air-conditioning going in the building today
 	
 	
 		oh my heck
 	
 	
 		it must be seventy five degrees out there
 	
 	
 		i think it's about twenty well it's about twenty eight here
 	
 	
 		i don't think that has anything to do with gun control
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but i i'm i
 	
 	
 		i i don't think it's a constitutional well so what if it's constitutional or not if if if my wife drives to west Texas alone she's going to carry a gun i don't care what they say
 	
 	
 		well don't you think too if the government i mean like in Yugoslavia and these places that the government comes in and takes over China don't you think if the people had a gun they would have more say in in in establishing a democracy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wasn't that amazing Yugoslavia was a semi Soviet state and no guns were allowed and all of a sudden everybody has one that wants to fight the war where did they come from
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they were hidden under the bed all these years
 	
 	
 		then they must have been
 	
 	
 		i don't know i don't know
 	
 	
 		they must have been hidden somewhere because they came out
 	
 	
 		well you know one thing about the Killeen situation that was pointed up is there were a lot of military people in the  in and around
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh if the military had been allowed to carry even side arms they could have stopped this idiot quicker
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i had a cop once say
 		in Texas it's not against the law let's see what i say i said it would be all right legally if i put on a a side gun and walked down the street with a gun strapped on my side it's clear view and you couldn't arrest me he said yes i can arrest you i said what for he said breaking the peace i said who's peace am a bothering he said mine i'm the cop
 		that was that was a joke it was a joke
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i think if you take them away from everybody then only criminals will have it and you would have more problems but but registration won't hurt anybody will it
 	
 	
 		no that's what i think that it should be is registration and guns that can be traced
 	
 	
 		yeah you can go to pawnshop i don't i don't know if you all live near big city Salt Lake City if they've got them or not but you go to a pawnshop and buy it for cash and you don't have to show nothing
 	
 	
 		but then
 		no
 		i think they have um
 		and you just hand over the cash and that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah you if you can show them a driver's license but you can steal those so easily it's pitiful
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i'm about an eight on that i think that uh that we need gun control but you know so many laws would be uh necessary if we'd just use common sense
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know just registering the guns and wow i don't know i guess people lose their common sense when they when they get mad or when they
 	
 	
 		get too drunk
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'll be there's a law in Texas says you can't have them in bar i think it would be a lot more sense if they say please check them at the front door because i know people are in there with them on
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i it just nerve racking to know that if you're in a
 	
 	
 		that that you're in the bar and somebody has a gun next to you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they're not supposed to but then again so
