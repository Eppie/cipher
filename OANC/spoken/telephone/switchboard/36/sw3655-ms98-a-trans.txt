 
     		
 	
 		so uh what do you think about child care
 	
 	
 		oh  well my my feelings on are it is uh i wouldn't take a child to a day care
 		you know i mean i'd i'd wind up um just a babysitter in a home
 	
 	
 		right
 		probably find someone how come you wouldn't take them to a day care just because of the
 	
 	
 		um um
 		well too many kids and and i think too many infections and things coming in
 	
 	
 		yeah they seem to pass a lot a
 	
 	
 		yeah sicknesses and i don't know then all the things you hear about them and
 	
 	
 		yeah you kind of wonder whether or not
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i'm sure there's some good ones but i just i don't think that i would hum
 	
 	
 		i took uh Cammy to a
 		oh it was a preschool day care type of thing
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i kind of i liked it in some ways and some ways i didn't um i think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah how was it
 	
 	
 		and
 		well
 		i think they had a
 		they had two teachers and i think there were twenty kids
 		but i only had her going two days and most the other kids were going more days
 		so that was probably my own fault
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that she didn't oh you know one thing i noticed is uh
 	
 	
 		she she went
 	
 	
 		um just they were trying to get her to teach her to write her name
 		and uh i didn't notice it until this summer when i was working with her that she'd bend her wrist all the way oh not in a natural shape form
 	
 	
 		oh she did
 	
 	
 		yes and uh i was kind of mad mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or
 		or uh tried to say look you're holding your she's holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff she but she was
 	
 	
 		uh wrapping her arm all the way around yeah
 	
 	
 		yes
 		and uh i hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point she was four
 		or three yeah she was uh it was last year
 		and uh then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on and i worked like i said i didn't notice it till then
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because i hadn't worked with writing letters or anything and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		stuff like that
 	
 	
 		well they'd never picked it out though huh or just never said anything
 	
 	
 		no they never
 		course like i said i took her two days a week and maybe that was my main reason for taking  her was um just social skills more than anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i felt she needed the social
 		just i didn't feel like she was mature enough socially and
 	
 	
 		yeah well one thing that's kind of different too though a preschool than than taking a  a infant under to a day care where they're taken care of
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah i think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know
 		preschool's a different thing but i think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know and or unless you have awfully good references
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		reliable um
 		people i don't know it's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long
 	
 	
 		well i think it's hard to leave them it is
 	
 	
 		it is the older ones it's not you don't even really have any
 		real worries because you know that they'll play with whoever's there and they usually adapt pretty well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it it is i think  just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will um
 	
 	
 		well and you know their kind of their schedules and you know if they're upset and
 		that type of a deal
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know how um people uh that have young kids work and work full time and
 		and do it really without being stressed out all the time i think it's
 		well i don't know
 		then then on the other hand i think it's harder to stay home in some regards
 		it's hard to
 		always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive and
 		at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess and you haven't got anything done and what am i gonna fix for supper
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah that is uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of hard to always feel like gosh what is is this important what i'm doing and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well um the work never ends  for sure  uh
 	
 	
 		no no it
 		it doesn't
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but i think that taking kids to a probably people that take them to uh preschools and day cares full time
 		oh they would  i don't know
 		probably just feel a different uh
 		i think i just think it would be hard to do that full time i feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that are they driving the babysitter crazy and
 	
 	
 		uh uh-huh or is everything okay
 	
 	
 		you know what
