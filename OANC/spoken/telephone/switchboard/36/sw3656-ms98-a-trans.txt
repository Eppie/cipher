 
     		
 	
 		now then are you there okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i'm here
 	
 	
 		so they're recording everything now
 	
 	
 		alrighty
 	
 	
 		but you tell me the crime is rampant out there
 	
 	
 		its really bad out here we just had a freeway shooting about three blocks from our house
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and on New Year's Eve you know how it's supposed to be bringing in the new year and everything the with the neighborhood we have around here it was automatic gunfire going off instead of fire works
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um well that's what we have had here in Dallas for oh for the past year we lost so many people due to crime this past year
 		so what do you think is the solution to any of this
 	
 	
 		well personally i've got two kids
 		and personally i'd like to see them teach something about it like in schools not make it mandatory but an optional thing
 		you know ways to avoid situations
 	
 	
 		do you think drugs have any have
 	
 	
 		i think it has a lot to do with it
 	
 	
 		do you think that's the majority of our crime
 	
 	
 		um well i'd say about half
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think here in Dallas we've got uh its greater than that i think you know like ninety percent of our crime is um connected with the the drug scene because we
 	
 	
 		most
 	
 	
 		beg your pardon go ahead
 	
 	
 		most of our crime around here is uh it's gang related gang violence gangs fighting gangs
 		and i think that's what really scares me
 		because i mean around here if you like if you wear red
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		one gang will take offense to it
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and if you wear black the other gang will take offense to it so you have to wear you know something neutral like blue in order not to get bothered around here
 		i mean people get bothered at the grocery stores and everything its getting pretty bad
 	
 	
 		you mean in their clothing they okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i did i'm not aware of that being
 		part of our problem it's just that uh  seems like these kids or older people that um
 		need the drug need the money for the drugs and then they're shooting and we have we had a little boy in west uh well it's west of here
 		was riding in the car with his mother and father on New Year's Eve night and someone fired into the car there were three children in the backseat
 		and the little boy that was in the uh an infant seat was dead they did the the mother and father did not even realize
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		that there had been ah i mean they thought fire crackers and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and when they arrived where they were to have had celebrated New Year's they found this baby dead and the bullet hole directly behind the driver's seat
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		now this is something that my Lord something's got to give
 		someone has to do something
 	
 	
 		i know and it's the innocent people that are paying for it it's not even the people that are doing it that are paying for it it's the innocent ones that are dying from it and it's not fair
 	
 	
 		well that's right
 		yes
 		no way can we um  anyway i pray that you have a good New Year
 		i hope it's a safe New Year for you
 		and have what about this isn't part of the conversation but have you had any rain out there
 	
 	
 		oh we've had a lot of it out here
 	
 	
 		okay that's what i understand California needs
 		but
 	
 	
 		yeah it it we do need it and there's been an awful lot of it
 	
 	
 		well
 		i mean  when you live in Texas you accept it when it comes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and don't complain about it
 	
 	
 		i guess you guys had a pretty good storm a while back though
 	
 	
 		oh i still have an apartment that has furniture up on bricks because of the rain um-hum and i live in a a nice part of Dallas but um
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		anyway if the if the criminals and do not come around here i'm going to be extremely fortunate um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah my my husband and i are thinking about moving because we've got two little boys
 		and it's just getting so bad around here that i'm afraid to even let them go out and play
 		i mean it's it's really bad with the gangs and everything
 	
 	
 		you mean this is not occur after after sundown its during the day too
 	
 	
 		the majority of it is at night but like the shootings and stuff on the freeways are done in broad daylight nobody will say anything because everybody's afraid
 	
 	
 		are
