 
     		
 	
 		why don't you tell me about the Brewers
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh  i guess the thing about the Brewers is i think their personnel policies have been a little misguided lately
 		um
 		i think that's their main problem uh they seem to have have stuck with the same core of players uh Robin Yount Paul Molitor and Jim Gantner
 		who uh they're real good players but they seem to just depend on them to produce a pennant and it it doesn't it isn't working
 	
 	
 		well the problem with the Rangers is they've got a lot of offense they just don't have any pitching and really haven't had any pitching for years
 		they're the top offensive team around but
 		defense and pitching wins your games over the long haul
 	
 	
 		except for papa Ryan anyway
 	
 	
 		well that's true but he only comes every five times so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right he can't win them all for him
 	
 	
 		he can't win them all and he's getting a little bit up there
 	
 	
 		yeah i think uh the thing about the Brewers is too their pitching they never have really had real good pitching uh
 		last time they had really good pitching was back in the early eighties when they got to the World Series was with uh people like Vuckovich and Fingers
 	
 	
 		oh yes Rollie Fingers
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and of course uh
 		he got them to the Series but then just before the Series that year in eighty two he um
 		uh threw his elbow out or something shoulder or elbow i can't remember which and uh
 		they're number two right-hander in the bullpen Pete Ladd who was kind of a rookie that year uh had to take his place and uh i think that's why they lost the series because in in game two in Saint Louis
 		they had a pretty good lead going into late innings and Ladd got rattled when he didn't get some calls and they ended up losing the game uh Ole Mustache Fingers would not have done that
 	
 	
 		well Rollie was
 		Rollie was more uh  well i guess he's uh is he in the Hall of Fame already i don't even remember
 	
 	
 		i can't remember if he's made it or not yet he he may not have been i don't know when he retired actually
 	
 	
 		you got to be retired for five years to be eligible
 	
 	
 		yeah but that was i think eighty two was
 		well eighty one was the year i think that he won the the uh
 		Cy Young and the MVP and the Fireman of the Year Award all at the same time i think but uh but in eighty two i think he won something some kind of award had a lot of saves anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah we had a game here where uh
 		we had Goose Gossage this year and Goose and uh Ryan combine and
 		they got i don't know Ryan got his three hundred something win and at the same time Goose got his three hundred and something save and they were you know the same number and they said that it was an unusual occurrence to have that
 	
 	
 		well i'd forgotten that Gossage was with the Rangers the the he was this year last year
 	
 	
 		yeah but he's not coming back
 	
 	
 		now did they pick him up uh sometime in the middle of the season or what
 	
 	
 		well no they got him at the very beginning of the season but he and the manager and manager Bobby Valentine didn't come along so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Goose is Goose is history
 	
 	
 		yeah well he's been quite a reliever in his time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah he's a he's he's definitely headed to the Hall of Fame
 		But the Rangers have you know a a pretty good lineup now um with the with the addition of the uh
 		Dickey Thorne at uh short stop that ought to help them but their problem is other than Ryan and an occasional flash of brilliance of other people there's just nobody there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we'll be looking for them to uh to improve in that area i guess because at least the uh
 		now that i think about them a little bit i'm getting sort of back through the football season back into baseball i realize when you think of the Rangers now you got a real good looking young outfield there for the most part and uh
 		quite a few of the infielders are
 		uh probably have good real good careers still ahead of them i'm not sure why they got rid of Buechele but i guess it worked out for him okay
 	
 	
 		well at least he got to play in a championship the Rangers have never won the division so
 		we're we're obviously not going to last year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh Inky went the wrong way though didn't he
 	
 	
 		yeah i think he's history
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he is history
 	
 	
 		now who did they trade him to i forgot Cleveland
 	
 	
 		Detroit
 	
 	
 		Detroit
 	
 	
 		well they didn't yeah they he went to Detroit they really didn't get much for him
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh they released him really didn't they
 	
 	
 		yeah they released him and he had to go around trying to sign up with somebody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but he proved to be a total disaster
 	
 	
 		my goodness when he was when he was when he could really get into a ball though he was uh had a lot of power i tell you he reminds me a lot of Gorman Thomas remember him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		center fielder for the Brewers there for a while there was a guy that
 	
 	
 		yeah he did something he i saw i saw him hit a grand slam once in a game when i was there but i also saw him
 		drop a ball that cost a couple runs ended up costing the game so he could you know he could be both brilliant and with a bat and just a disaster in the field
 	
 	
 		uh well i don't think his fielding was generally that bad he uh as a matter of fact he was to
 	
 	
 		it was early on it got better but it was pretty bad at the beginning
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		yeah he did get better and i think uh he was one of George Bamburger's big projects when he took over at the Brewers at Milwaukee
 		he was the guy that was up and down uh
