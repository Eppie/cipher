 
     		
 	
 		kind of pets you got
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we got two Cocker Spaniels at the house uh a female and a and a male and at the office i have tropical fish how about yourself
 	
 	
 		fish in the office may dad used to have fish in his office years ago
 		we've got three cats
 	
 	
 		meow meow cats
 	
 	
 		meow meow cats
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's that's exactly what they do we got we've got um one that's about three and a half and he's black and white
 		and one that's three and she's all white although she's a little dirty now and then we got one that's a year old and is what they call tortoise tortoise hair which is kind of multi
 		multicolored and um
 		she's the one that's most vocal i think
 	
 	
 		my sister and her husband had cat and it was kind of an alley cat and it kept going out in the alley and getting pregnant
 		and it looked kind of like a Persian cat but anyway went and got pregnant the first time they advertised in the newspaper free kittens and and nobody would come over and do anything
 		and then they changed to ad to read Persian like kittens thirty five dollars and they were gone in one day
 		
 
 	
 	
 		free market it worked well all all our cats have been uh have been neutered or spayed or what have you our white cat has
 		got some Persian like qualities and big and it's and it's very long haired
 		which makes it look even bigger the other two are short haired cats
 	
 	
 		we let our female uh get pregnant as a matter of fact it's AKC so we reached out for a stud
 		and when the the uh puppies arrived we made sure the children were there to see it uh we thought it was a
 		very simple uh
 		course in birth
 		birds and the bees and uh
 		the dog has had two litters and i'm glad the children experienced the process uh
 		i didn't see anything wrong with it
 	
 	
 		as i said we're we're not going to end up with any kittens we figured we had two other cats before these both of one of which died from old age
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was about um fourteen and a half
 		and then one died very young from feline leukemia years ago when they didn't you know now they've got shots for feline leukemia but back when this cat died
 		which was oh some ten years ago they didn't have feline leukemia shots so
 		so it got ill then it got better and then it got ill and died immediately so
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well we nearly lost a dog the second time she had a litter we didn't get her on vitamins soon enough
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		some distressed children uh the dog was just the hindquarters wouldn't work so we ran to the vet one Sunday morning believe it or not they've got twenty four hour vets in emergency clinics and they they charge
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they charge like that too
 		and uh he said well there's three things and he said well that's not it the second one that's not by the time he got to second that's not the kid's were in the lobby just crying their heads off
 		and the third one got corrected the dog and we saved the dog thank goodness it just it didn't have the right vitamins to keep it going with the the puppies draining her milk
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		so we enjoy dogs because uh they kind of bark when someone shouldn't be around the house we do not let them in the house at all but they're outside dogs and uh
 		what are your cats do they uh meow at all if some stranger comes
 	
 	
 		well i don't think so but they're inside
 		um part of the time outside part of the time and um
 		oh i don't know they uh
 		well they're not watch cats or anything but i tell you what we don't have any mice or or any uh rodents or anything like that they
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they certainly keep things uh neat and clean things stay away
 	
 	
 		do do do they actually kill mice
 	
 	
 		uh well at one time we know we've had cats that have killed mice and most of time unfortunately they end up killing birds
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and they'll leave us a present on the back or front step and there'll be a  bird
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		missing a head or you know whatever but uh we got in at least once i saw cat one of the cats not this cat but one of them that's now died that that had a had a mouse and one time one of the cats got a a rabbit that was in the backyard
 	
 	
 		killed it
 	
 	
 		no uh we got it to let go the rabbit we heard this horrible shrill noise and didn't know what it was and it was a rabbit screaming for it life so we went out there and convinced the cat to let go of the rabbit
 	
 	
 		well we've got a pet rabbit in the house i forgot to mention that and uh
 		when we've been having a fence put in the dog got to the rabbit and it was no longer a live rabbit
 	
 	
 		oh my well i we where over to a friend's house they had a pet rabbit and this pet rabbit looks just like our white cat we always called the white cat a big rabbit and the fact of it the cat and the rabbit looked pretty similar
 	
 	
 		have you heard about people that house train their rabbits
 	
 	
 		these people had their rabbits outside
 	
 	
 		well this is our we do too it's in a cage but people
