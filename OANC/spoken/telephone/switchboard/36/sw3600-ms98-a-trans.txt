 
     		
 	
 		how you enjoy lawn and garden work
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well yes and no  we live um on a cul-de-sac and we're at the end so we kind of have like two yards so to speak
 		and um it's really tough in the summer time mowing because we just have so much yard to to uh take care of
 	
 	
 		do y'all have a riding lawn mower
 	
 	
 		no we don't that's on our wish list one of these days but that's how we get our exercise is get out there with the mower and
 		what we did this uh past summer was we tried to because we're doing we do it the mulching rather than bag it and all
 		and uh we try to do it about twice a week so that was really quite the chore
 	
 	
 		our first house when we got married was a third of an acre and we had plenty front yard side yards and back backyards
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		the next house was uh a lot smaller we had a swimming pool in the back and front the third house we're in now the backyard is total swimming pool
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the sides are slowly disappearing into into uh other things and the front's very small so the size of my yard is decreasing in proportion to my age uh i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		right well that that makes sense though
 	
 	
 		i'm i've gotten to where i enjoyed digging in the little flower beds rather than uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh mowing mowing and and i we've got the third house has an automatic sprinkler system which i wouldn't be without again
 	
 	
 		the actual maintenance of the yard uh-huh
 		well see that's what that's also on our wish list we um couple years ago we landscaped our our whole front yard
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um my husband has lived in the house for several years and we finally decided well we're just gonna go in and redo everything
 		and we did that and we debated at the time about putting in you know sprinkler system like in the in the flower beds
 		and we thought well when we do it we're just gonna do in the flower beds and the whole yard
 	
 	
 		you might not do the flower beds i've had a guy that's in bugs and pest control he says you're really inviting termites when you go into the flower beds and keep it real moist
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		well speaking of termites we had those this past summer too
 	
 	
 		did y'all really oh i had those in house number two and it cost me a thousand bucks to get rid of them and then when i went to renew see the guy for renar renewal the one year warranty renewal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		he'd gone out of business so my yes
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah that's that's a tough thing we got a with our deal we got about a five year warranty and we're just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		who'd y'all go with
 	
 	
 		a place called TKO Exterminating there he's out in Rowlett and i hope that he's going to around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		stays in business yeah i i the the big ones the national chains Orkid or whoever he is they were a lot more expensive but
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		if i have it do over again i will go with a major corporation because well gust because the guy retires and  there goes your warranty when he retires
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know that's the that's the thing and we thought about that and we thought well we're just gonna kind of i guess take our chances and hopefully end up on the better end of the deal
 	
 	
 		what kind of plants do you have in your garden when y'all landscaped
 	
 	
 		we've got some uh Yaupon hollies Chinese hollies uh the monkey grass
 	
 	
 		yeah we're we're right behind you on those
 		you listen to Neil Sperry too right
 	
 	
 		yeah  well actually the first time we relandscaped we did it in the fall they say that's the best time to do it and we did it then and we had Indian Hawthornes in which are so pretty because they have the little you know uh blossoms on them
 		but those are not freeze tolerant and we had a freeze and we had to replace we took about
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		twenty plants back that next spring to the nursery and we had a lifetime guarantees so we just got new plants and put those in
 	
 	
 		beautiful  if you want a little flower bed system automatically PVC piping is dirt cheap
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they sell connections that go from a short hose you buy a short hur hose and the connections and you lay it in your flower bed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and the the the sprinkler head that you buy at the store fit right in to PVC
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		and so you just lay that in your flower bed and then when you're ready to water all you do is put the hose into your PVC thing turn it on and it does it right there and you don't have to move the hose or anything
 	
 	
 		okay
 		you probably uh-huh uh-huh
 		oh okay
 		yeah because see that's what's such a pain is the constant moving is the you know
 	
 	
 		i know i know i know i'm so proud of my house with the automatic
 	
 	
 		well that's that's hopefully we did a lot of work on our house this past summer
 		and um we thought the next thing will be a sprinkler system but that probably won't be for
 		a couple of years now  because we really  did a whole lot this summer spent too much money so
 	
 	
 		well you get it the way you want it and just perfect and sit back for a while i hope y'all don't have to get transferred or anything now that you got it the way you want it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i know i hate it when people do that they'll sit there and fix up their house and then they move and no we're gonna we plan on staying here for awhile
 	
 	
 		
 
 		did
 		did you hear the price on the discount is down to three percent today the lowest the banks in three twenty five years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the mortgages  i'm gonna be refinancing the rent house our house and everything else i i just can't wait they're talking you know seven eight percent
 	
 	
 		yeah i know
 		yep yep
 	
 	
 		well anyway
