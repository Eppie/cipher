 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh what are the capital punishment laws in your state
 	
 	
 		uh they're
 	
 	
 		or do you have it
 	
 	
 		uh they're they're the death penalty can be imposed
 	
 	
 		yeah uh or is it set for a specific crimes uh you know if you're convicted of this then it's the death penalty or or is it kind of just to the discretion under certain cases
 	
 	
 		uh it's uh murder it it can be
 		is i think is the only can be tried for you know for
 		uh capital punishment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i firmly believe in it
 	
 	
 		yes uh i
 		i'm the same way i feel that capital punishment ought to be mandatory under certain crimes
 	
 	
 		i do too here in Utah there's been a a person that's been on death row for
 		i oh seventeen years i think and they just keep retrying and retrying and i just it's just a waste of taxpayers' money and and i really think it would be a deterrent
 	
 	
 		sounds like he'd grow old and die long before they get to kill him
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		seventeen years on death row
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh i think he's that he's the longest one in the nation that and they just keep retrying him and retrying him
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		since they reinstated the death penalty was it about seven or eight years ago i think the shortest anybody's waited has been two or three years
 		i mean death penalty does not seem to be swift for anybody
 	
 	
 		no is what's the death penalty in Mississippi
 	
 	
 		i
 		so that's my understanding they do not have death penalty here right now um
 	
 	
 		i mean the capital
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it doesn't make any sense that they don't but they don't
 		um
 		and right now to the best of my understanding there is nothing afoot to get it reinstated
 		uh
 		personally i think there should be death penalty for
 		uh
 		the death penalty should be available almost any
 		major violent crime
 		and mandatory for murder
 	
 	
 		i i agree with you
 		they believe
 	
 	
 		it should be at least available as punishment for rape
 	
 	
 		yes definitely
 	
 	
 		i think if it was a serious  possible of being executed for doing any of the major crimes that it would be a little less likely for people to commit them
 	
 	
 		well one thing i can't understand is is these people that uh
 		uh torture torture children and then murder i mean you know and then they're they eventually kill them
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and i definitely think that that should be a death penalty and they get less than than people that have are murdered
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't understand that i i just can't see how come a person that has kills a little child can get away with two or three years or five years
 		five to fifteen
 	
 	
 		yeah and it
 	
 	
 		because
 	
 	
 		i don't know i if i think also they should be
 		they uh somebody providing drugs to someone that kills the person
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that ought to be considered murder and potential death penalty
 	
 	
 		boy we think alike
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		they used to have the death penalty in my home state of West Virginia
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and
 		there it was death by hanging
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh
 	
 	
 		uh but
 	
 	
 		how old are you may i ask
 	
 	
 		thirty four
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it when they eliminated death penalty all kinds of things changed
 	
 	
 		yes they do
 	
 	
 		uh the rate of crime doubled within about about a year or so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and at that point when they were still hanging the uh state prison in Mountsville
 		uh
 		had a very small guard force and they had very little problems with their their inmates
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh after they eliminated the death penalty shut down the gallows
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the place has gotten to the point where people who live in that area
 		are all trying to get moved away it's become a maximum security prison they have had a whole lot more problems with breakouts with uh with violence within the the prison
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh just the whole whole tenor of the thing has changed completely
 	
 	
 		i wonder why i wonder why they don't uh
 		don't uh see that they need the death penalty then
 		because haven't you heard that they say that the death penalty does not
 		uh deter crime
 	
 	
 		who is it who said the death penalty doesn't deter crime well i'm sure it doesn't much now because the death penalty is very seldom uh given and
 	
 	
 		used
 	
 	
 		even then like you say it could be twenty twenty years between the time
