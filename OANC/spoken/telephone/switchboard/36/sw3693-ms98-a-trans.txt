 		yes i have a twelve year old
 		and i've been very lucky i haven't needed child care except for my mom so i've been real lucky i'm a nurse i go to school i mean i go to work early
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for his school or just hangs by while she gets ready drives her to school then i'm home to pick her up so i'm very very lucky
 	
 	
 		well that's nice
 		that is lucky well how old um does a child have to be before you have to you get to stop making arrangements for him i wonder
 	
 	
 		well i could do it now but she gets lonely in the morning and i feel better um she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just don't let her out of my sight so
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh-huh
 		well and um it's nice for them not to be alone
 	
 	
 		um
 		you never know yeah yeah she feels that way you know and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we just feel better doing it this way so i don't know what day we'll stop we we were about to stop one day this year and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats and so
 	
 	
 		that is a rule
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		we didn't stop and so  so um you know it you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen so even though she's twelve she's still a kid so
 	
 	
 		yes
 		she is
 	
 	
 		you got to be careful
 	
 	
 		well i'm glad you had that um opportunity to have your mom
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm glad too
 	
 	
 		well i I have two kids and uh five and six a girl and a boy and um so far i haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm at home now full time but um when i was going to school i would go to school a time that my husband wasn't you know when he was at home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that we would just switch back and forth like that but um it's really scary and i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care
 	
 	
 		well i would too because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i i just don't know what i would do if i had to do that i know the hospital that i work in is big hospital and they provide child care and of course they charge for it but at least all the nurses can leave their children and
 	
 	
 		no
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they're always watching them they can eat lunch with them if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run over and check on them and they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way
 	
 	
 		um
 		well that's nice
 	
 	
 		so yeah it is nice
 	
 	
 		and i know that i have um done some babysitting myself
 		and uh when i was in school and needed extra money and i know how i feel how i felt as a provider of child care that even though you're you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to
 		you know treat them equally and you know better usually better than your own um it's not the same and it made me realize that um no one will love your child as much as you and your mother your
 	
 	
 		right right
 		well that's right
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		and um the family and no one will look out after them and i just think um
 		so far i think my preference would be rather than to have like a
 		oh a big day care that um what is that like child KinderCare and things like that rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i would prefer to have in home care either my own home or a neighbor or something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah just never know i babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it it was hard to treat her equally with my child they were the same age and they played together and they were good friends
 		but like you said you tend to go more for the other one's side just because you are responsible and so it it got hard and my daughter got jealous and
 	
 	
 		right
 		it is hard
 	
 	
 		um it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends because she had to be there every day so i stopped that after a year because it was difficult to balance it so
 	
 	
 		no
 		no
 		and i know um when i pick my kids up from school they wanna come home and i and i would hate for them to have be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation
 	
 	
 		they do
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		i know i know
 	
 	
 		so i think uh my preference would be a small small if i had to find day care would be a small someone that i knew
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i would rather do without some things and i know that some parents they both do have to work but a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i would never do that i never have done it and i just never would do it i would rather do without some things that really aren't very important compared to being with my child when they're growing up so
 	
 	
 		no
 		well that's true because even now when they're gone to school it seems like there's just not enough time left over in the day
 	
 	
 		no there isn't there isn't any time that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time and there's just not enough to time in the day to do anything good quality for them
 		but that's really
