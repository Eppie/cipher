 
     		
 	
 		okay i guess tonight's subject is uh woodworking do you uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what kind of woodworking do you do
 	
 	
 		well kind kind of mainly the woodworking i've done lately is uh  made like uh for example a little nativity scene um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		not the uh the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and and some
 		odd stuff around the house and so i i enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking and i do it out of hobby more than uh um you know something i have to do how about yourself
 	
 	
 		uh well well it yeah i like to think of it as a hobby but i i guess also partly out of necessity just repairing things around the house
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um a few years ago uh we we needed uh they needed some book shelves and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves and
 		um uh it it actually worked pretty well and over the years i've i've refined those plans i got myself a router and i'm i'm very good at making book shelves
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it it's also a way of relieving stress my wife kind of laughs at me that anytime i get stressed i just go out in the garage and we've got more book shelves  but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i'll have to come and see them that sounds like a good idea i you know and that's that is right it is out of necessity because a lot of the things that uh well we can't be able to afford
 		but also i i sometimes sometimes think that uh i enjoy doing that and i like to get out and and uh to work with my hands
 		and uh sounds like you got some real nice tools too do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools
 	
 	
 		uh  well yeah i mean little by little i i started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		gotten a a good belt sander and and the router uh helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the latest project that i've been working on and and this has kind of been sitting here for a few months is a
 		a cabinet to to put a TV in
 	
 	
 		oh a entertainment type center oh
 	
 	
 		right and it that's works well because you can design it to to suit whatever equipments you have
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i designed a space just the right size for the TV and then the the the VCR and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment and uh
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		that's worked pretty well
 		uh  with uh with the router you can make nice uh  i guess dado joints is what it's called
 	
 	
 		right or yes i yeah i'm aware of that
 	
 	
 		um and it's uh
 	
 	
 		and also with a router you can uh make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge and uh
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		casings and so forth that are that are real nice so that that's good that's good
 	
 	
 		what i what i need next is a good table saw and i i debate whether it the better if you get a uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws radial arm saws i guess what they're called
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um it it seems to me the radial arm saws is better
 		well it it takes up less room i mean you you set the wood down and you move the saw whereas if you're ripping wood you're probably better off with a a table saw
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 		well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that
 		um but uh yeah a table saw does take a lot of time excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh that that's partly my problem now is i don't have room for this i uh
 		a we're uh where we lived before up north uh basements were were common and i could've put all this stuff in my basement but not so here in Texas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes uh-huh
 		no they don't have basements well i'm from up north also and and uh no there's no  basements down here and it's kind of uh hard to get uh shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah lot of the equipment too that i've i've used in the past uh i would you know i've used in school and uh
 		i would i don't know i'd i'd kind of like to to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make uh some pretty nice
 		uh
 		pieces of uh well wood for for different things for tables for for or um
 		chairs for you know decks and so forth so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i just enjoy woodworking and i think the the main thing is like you say it's a it's a good out it's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day and it's a great strase stress reliever
 	
 	
 		have you ever used a lathe
 	
 	
 		yes i have in school i have and i've made uh uh different things uh lathe type tables for chairs and i've made uh bowls and um
 		and uh
