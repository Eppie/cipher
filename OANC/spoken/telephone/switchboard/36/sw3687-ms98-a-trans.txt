 
     		
 	
 		uh what uh guess i should have talked before uh what team do you wanna
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		are you familiar with i guess or do you have a favorite team i guess
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah my favorite team's probably the Reds yeah i'm from Cincinnati yeah
 	
 	
 		is it are are you really great
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh most national league teams i'm pretty familiar with
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i uh i'm i'm familiar with the Reds myself we lived out there in Dayton for three years so we used to root from the line i don't know they got a pretty good team but i see i kind of think the Braves are the gonna ones be the ones to go places this year
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah that's what i thought even last year i thought they'd be doing pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah they're pretty they're so young and everything i i was just starting to get Dave Justice is one of my favorite players so
 	
 	
 		yeah he's pretty exciting to watch
 	
 	
 		i'm hoping he can pull them through and maybe have a good series like they did against the Twins again
 	
 	
 		yeah i think the Dodgers you got to look out for with all the the hitting they've gotten recently
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and who else did they pick up they got Strawberry and who else did they
 	
 	
 		they got Davis from the Reds
 	
 	
 		Davis too
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh they traded away for some pitcher too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah because they dealt Belcher and then they got someone else i forgot his name though
 	
 	
 		huh yeah i've i've kind of i they always make me nervous because Lasorda's good coach and everything but uh they got the bucks to spend they can get all those guys
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems like they always get the the high paid guys and they always seem to end up doing pretty good for a while
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i uh i'm kind of a Mets fan myself too i uh like to see them go i don't know why but because they're
 	
 	
 		well they just signed uh what Bonilla from Pittsburgh yeah
 	
 	
 		Bonilla  i see that's being from Pennsylvania i thought you'd maybe be a Pittsburgh fan but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but no huh  do you
 	
 	
 		no i keep up on it yeah i tell you though he's getting what six million a year or something
 	
 	
 		yeah you cannot it's kind of hard to turn that down that's for sure
 	
 	
 		yeah you got to think Bonds is worth more than that too
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely i wonder if he is he gonna stay with them or
 	
 	
 		no he's looking to leave from what i hear
 	
 	
 		oh if he leaves then they're they're done with they won't go anywhere this year i mean that's their two biggest guys that are walking so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they signed a couple of their pitchers who are gonna be free agents
 	
 	
 		yeah they resigned them well that's good that'll help but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they got Walken someone else they resigned
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't be surprised to see them if they go after Bonds but
 	
 	
 		they're not gonna give them more than six million a year they can't afford it
 	
 	
 		well i don't think anybody can i don't know if anybody's worth that much for what they do but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i really i say i really hope the Braves can pull it through they're i think they caught everybody's imagination last year it was a it was great series but it'd been fun to see them win it
 	
 	
 		yeah you got to like the underdog
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true maybe they can pull it off again but i tell you i don't know it's
 		so are you a big baseball fan or do do you
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty much yeah up where we are we don't get much baseball news but uh i try to keep up on it
 	
 	
 		oh do you just through the  papers or whatnot
 	
 	
 		yeah reading the little transactions column is about all we get
 	
 	
 		oh huh
 		well what do you think about the A's and Canseco and those guys have they got any chance or
 	
 	
 		i don't know they really surprised me last year when they dropped off so quick
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm wondering if they're maybe just getting a little bit too high paid and thinking they're so good and
 	
 	
 		yeah too many attitudes out there
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		too many attitudes out there i think so i think it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true that's definitely true
 	
 	
 		they got a lot of high paid players that could start somewhere else as backup
 	
 	
 		yep that's true got to get Canseco's mind off Madonna and then he might be able to play a little bit  yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah or Steve Pickett's
 		yeah but they were in the World Series so many years straight then they were in like third or fourth or something
 	
 	
 		yeah then they that's like they dropped off the map and they had all the same players but
 	
 	
 		yeah the Reds did the same thing players then down into fifth
 	
 	
 		yep
 		oh yeah that surprised me because they were so tough and then i just i just wonder like i say if they lose the desire they did it once and then they just forget it and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know but uh
 	
 	
 		you figured after all the Rose stuff was over everything would be fine and it was but then i don't know what happened last year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah they just like i say they tailed right off but yeah i heard Davis was hurt quite a bit so that kind of hurt them
 	
 	
 		yeah but he always is i mean that's why they got rid of him he only plays like half a season
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		yeah it'll be interesting to see what he does now that he's out there with his bud Strawberry and if all of a sudden he becomes healthy all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah he kept on saying that uh the Reds should switch to natural grass just for his knees but uh they never did but they got that out in LA that should help him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah it'll help
 		but yeah we used to i was back there with the Reds when Ray Knight used to play and when he yeah when he took well it was the year that he took Pete Rose's place and of course he couldn't do anything right and
 	
 	
 		yeah third base
 	
 	
 		but uh we used to go i used to get free tickets for from school and go out and watch them but uh so they were always kind of were kind of a good my dad still loves them that's his favorite team but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i can remember going to games there when i was a kid
 	
 	
 		yeah that was good fun if i the stadium's what was amazing to me i mean we've got nothing that big out here as far as a you know baseball or football stadium you know walk inside and it was just huge to to see them but uh
 		it would seem like it was always bigger on the inside than it was outside
 	
 	
 		yeah because it looks small on the outside
 	
 	
 		yeah i had all these huge i we always were up in the nose bleed seats so we never got a chance to get too close but
 	
 	
 		yeah and anytime you try to walk down the uh the ushers would always tell you to go back
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i did that a few tried that a few times can i see your tickets and then you just get up and leave because you know there's no other
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah or uh oh i left them up in my seat
 	
 	
 		yeah  yep but uh i don't know yeah i like i enjoy baseball i play a lot of softball
