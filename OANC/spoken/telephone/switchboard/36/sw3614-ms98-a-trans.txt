 		oh
 		uh-huh how did you like that was that too fast oh was it oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was great yeah because i had my son with me uh my sixteen year old son and so uh it was it was a good experience for him to see some of the things he had studied and so forth
 	
 	
 		boy i'll say
 		uh-huh now was that before um before the two Germanies were when they were separate or
 	
 	
 		no it was a it was well yeah it was as it was happening actually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		was it really oh wow
 	
 	
 		kind of uh it was it was pretty close to that time but
 	
 	
 		you were there right while history was taking place
 	
 	
 		but we weren't over in that part of the world so it wasn't really uh something that we
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		got a lot of of input into but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		how about yourself where do where do you like to go to vacation
 	
 	
 		well uh we take our vacations we mostly go camping in the mountains we live in a little mountain community and um
 		even when i was growing up though we would go to places like oh Redfish Lake in Idaho and um
 		Island Park in Idaho different places like that i have been to uh my husband and i have been different places like to Disney World and
 		i'm not a real big person for flying  i just as soon would would travel you know on the ground um
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		you get some great camping areas in your
 	
 	
 		we do we do
 	
 	
 		area there close i'm a i'm a Boy Scout leader so i'm out backpacking camping quite a bit too and
 	
 	
 		oh boy i'll say you probably are
 	
 	
 		i've done uh mountains in New Mexico and Colorado but i never have gotten up into Idaho and Wyoming and and those parts of Utah that are so pretty and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		oh there there are there're some gorgeous places have you you've never been to the Tetons or
 	
 	
 		no i would like to
 	
 	
 		any of those spots oh it is nice now when you go skiing do you you fly here i imagine no
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah you either fly into Denver or Salt Lake or somewhere and then rent a car and go the rest of the way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh and do you enjoy that
 	
 	
 		yes yeah in fact
 	
 	
 		do you come alone or with your
 	
 	
 		usually with uh just whoever uh uh the whole office is going skiing i'm taking my my whole office in uh February to Crested Butte and then uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in a week mom and i agreed to chaperon my son's school trip to Vale with about fifty five young people
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		oh wow  i'm oh boy you will have your your hands full how long is that gonna be for
 	
 	
 		and five adults  so i'm in
 		uh
 		that'll be uh five days in March
 	
 	
 		oh huh
 	
 	
 		but uh sometimes i've taken my girl friend and gone last last winter i did that and so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh well how fun now when you went abroad did you was it a package plan or did you plan it yourself or
 	
 	
 		planned it myself and uh arranged for a private uh residence in um England through a guy that we knew that had a flat there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then uh the travel agent downstairs helped me with uh a lodging place in Paris
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then we  kind of booked some other things on our own that was so it was sort of a piece meal thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh well that did that work out good would you do that again
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think so it depend depend on where i was going i had good inside information about where i was headed and so i knew uh kind of what i was getting into but if
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 		what
 	
 	
 		if i were to strike out to a part of the world i didn't know anything about i i might not do it all on my own
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum did you have places arranged that you wanted to see that you know on your schedule then
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we kind of had a list going of things and we
 		did some trade-offs and we saw most of what we wanted to see uh uh we had a list of far more than we could possibly see so we kind of had to pick and choose a little bit
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		had to cut decide what you really wanted to once you got there
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh sometimes you wound up staying longer at one place and than another
 	
 	
 		oh well that's fun i um i can get tickets airline tickets through my brother and uh
 		he's a pilot and so we take a few but weekend type jaunts to Chicago and and different places around and that's fun too that's a good little vacation they say
 		you know just a couple days getting away it makes means a lot it
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		but if you don't like to fly then
 	
 	
 		i don't but i am getting better  used to be i'd i'd almost couldn't
 	
 	
 		you're uh
 	
 	
 		you know bring myself to stay on the plane but but now i'm getting better  so huh any other vacations you wanted to talk about or
 	
 	
 		well uh i one place i haven't done is go somewhere like a cruise in in a warm climate or or down into a tropical place for a beach vacation
