 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay  well considering you moved here from California i guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you would have down there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		yeah we have um in California i'm in central i lived in central California we have rain couple times a year and other than that you know it'd be maybe October and then in the spring and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain
 	
 	
 		especially the last few years
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's kind of has it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it uh
 	
 	
 		yeah there has
 		so here i know that um last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state and i'm glad to see there haven't been any this year
 	
 	
 		that's what i was thinking
 		yet  generally if we're gonna get them it's not going to happen uh prior to January one you know you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in December but
 	
 	
 		yeah yet still could come huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		usually the bitterest weather if we're gonna have any comes in January and February then by March things are getting warm again so we really don't have as long a cold season i guess as people up north
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah yeah it's so hard to predict here
 	
 	
 		it's been eighty degrees on Christmas day here before  lots of times
 	
 	
 		yeah well today it's not bad out there
 	
 	
 		no it's nice i just came in from outside and it's it's really pretty it's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		before it rains again i'm a i'm a scoutmaster and so i wind up going out camping with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh a bunch of boys at one time and so its better for us if it hasn't been just totally wet before we go
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah so you do that even in January huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah we camp year round
 	
 	
 		yeah oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		but uh it's uh it's definitely different and then i guess you've been through a couple of summers here too right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yep and they're not too pleasant  it gets so humid to me it's humid here people that i know that come from um like Georgia or North Carolina yeah they say this isn't humid
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it is
 		it's not as humid as Houston say or Atlanta but it
 	
 	
 		yeah but i find it humid
 	
 	
 		its more humid than Arizona and California for the most part
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		were you northern California
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i was central California Central Valley so it's very dry there
 	
 	
 		central okay so that was
 		dry but pretty even climate wasn't it year round fairly not wide fluctuations
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well it's pretty hot in the summer it's in the usually you know for a good three four weeks we have over a hundred degrees but it's a dry heat yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's a drier
 		hundred  when you have a hundred here everybody's dying
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i know huh well i lived in Africa for a couple years in
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		Cameroon and that's a tropical climate and it really feels similar to this during the summer
 	
 	
 		what types of what take what type of business takes you to those climates or was that just vacation or something
 	
 	
 		no i was um working with um i still work with Wycliffe Bible Translators
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's an organization where we are looking to translate the Bible into languages of the world that aren't yet written
 	
 	
 		not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages
 	
 	
 		right languages that don't have anything written yet so this is like the first thing that's written down or you know first an alphabet is developed and then um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's interesting you don't think about that as a career a normal career uh when you're thinking of things that people might be doing
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 		yeah well it's based here um the international headquarters for Wycliffe Bible Translators is right here in in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh so you're you're with the home office now
 	
 	
 		yeah right now i am so that's what brought me here
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well the uh
 		i think uh all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas uh the weather
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know does change fast and things do happen severely a few times a year but there's an awful lot of good weather too in between
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree i agree i
 		i thought the fall was really nice
 	
 	
 		yeah and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh i like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		particularly if i'm gonna be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things and that's nicer yeah i do quite a bit of that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah and you probably do a lot of that with scouts scouting uh-huh
 	
 	
 		think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east Texas and it is a little more humid out there than it is here so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess we'll
 		the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the
 		really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains there's not much between us and the North Pole  and then when you get one of those tornado type
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms and it
 		it doen't seem to be
