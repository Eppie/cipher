 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay what kind of foods would you have
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um well i like to cook um but i don't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because um
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		uh it's too much pressure  you know if i have people over for dinner i like it to be nice but relaxed yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well yeah you can't enjoy it right
 	
 	
 		and so i don't like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out so
 	
 	
 		that's that's what i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking in the oven it's  everybody just
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		says how wonderful it is and it's it's like uh yes uh i that's one of those things that i got famous for in college people would come and say could you would you come over and make lasagna for me  it's like well i can't really give you a recipe um  i can
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh you just do it
 	
 	
 		i can just do it  so it's i like doing that kind of stuff and it's it's fun because in fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we just had a bunch of people over and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and ah yummy
 	
 	
 		um boy i like that
 	
 	
 		uh i do too in fact
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'm planning a and naturally this is appropriate because i'm planning dinner for um people tomorrow night and the next night hm on Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether so
 	
 	
 		oh oh good
 		uh i'd say one thing we've done have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it's a real easy is just baked potato dinners
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and have you like three or four couples come over and i'll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it turns out great because i mean you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah that's fun
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it's it's inexpensive plus it's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it and you got a great dinner
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		it's it's real easy i like doing that part ah i'm in favor of very little clean up um very little planning  because we've got three or four  couples that we get together with to play games and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's we invariably end up at my house since i've got two kids and that it's it's fine because then i can just say okay fine you bring this you bring this you bring this we're done oh it's pretty cool
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah that's good well one of my favorites if i don't wanna have other people bring stuff i just wanna treat them is to make chicken and rice it's it's very easy to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you don't like it oh you do okay yeah i have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken and then you
 	
 	
 		oh i love it
 		hm
 	
 	
 		put rice in the bottom of the pan you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it and or you put the chicken in then pour the uh broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want and then just
 	
 	
 		oh
 		over the uncooked rice
 	
 	
 		yeah over uncooked rice and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven and it just it fluffs up and it's really moist and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh how neat
 		huh now i've done it with where you put you cook the rice well i guess you probably could do it some way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a bit of white wine in it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh ooh yeah
 	
 	
 		and every once in a while i'll put in white i'll slice white grapes and i'll put it in there and
 		that's because i'm not a real big wine person but i like it it it adds something to the chicken and then just bake it and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		hm well i'll keep that one in mind too yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah  it's it that was one of the first things i made for my husband because it's like hm yeah i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah you can get away with it and you know in having a semi nice dinner or you know semi formal but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		but then i didn't i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice so just like in a thirteen by nine pan
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you put in um let's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice or
 	
 	
 		hm
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it depends on you can really vary it but you have to put the water in proportionally i can't remember i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups um broth
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 		yeah yeah it's i i use that for breakfast for rice and for when i cook pasta or something i'll i'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah that's flavor um-hum
 	
 	
 		hm now that would be good how long do you have to bake it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh um let's see i think it was an hour i've done it in the microwave so often lately because it's it's really easy  yeah
 	
 	
 		i do i do microwave too a lot  it's
 	
 	
 		but i think it's about an hour or maybe it's only half hour hm um
 	
 	
 		how long would it be in the microwave how long would it be in the microwave
 	
 	
 		you just until the rice looks fluffy and and not overdone you know before it gets overdone
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		okay  do you just brown the chicken to get it colored or do you go ahead and let it cook through
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah um i'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster but
 	
 	
 		okay hm
 		oh this is a beneficial call i like this  yeah but that one's an easy one it's like just put in a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the with the soup and the wine put in garlic and onion powder
 	
 	
 		yeah well i liked it your idea too there
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or chopped onions if you wanna do that you know whatever whatever you however much effort you feel like putting into it but it it makes a great i mean my i've got a two year old and a four year old and they love it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and because because my daughter calls it her gravy and i mean she thinks it's wonderful i'm like good you're a picky eater if i can get you to eat
