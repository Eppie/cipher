 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what kind of home is yours pretty similar to the ones around you or
 	
 	
 		well i think so i mean
 	
 	
 		is it
 	
 	
 		we live in a neighborhood where
 		you know the none of the homes are exactly exactly alike
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		our home's a two story home and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there's about half and half in our neighborhood that are ramblers that are two stories
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is yours a split entry
 	
 	
 		no no it's just a
 	
 	
 		no it's a
 	
 	
 		it's a regular two story all the bedrooms are upstairs and the and everything else is downstairs the basement is
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		unfinished now you you live in Mantua don't you
 	
 	
 		right yes uh we live in a ours is a little  um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		ours the street is fairly new in fact we were the very first home on the street and we've lived here almost nine years
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yes and so we were we were the first one and um
 		and i we don't have a garage or and the and the basement is not finished in fact we're just trying to
 		review our options right now and decide whether we want to finish the basement and add on a garage or whether we're going to find something else or
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		gee we're just growing out of it
 	
 	
 		did you build the house
 	
 	
 		yes yes we did it it was new and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's a variety of of homes along our street in fact next door to us is a log cabin home
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yes and it's it's just beautiful inside it's
 	
 	
 		do you like it
 	
 	
 		i do but if i think if i had a log cabin i'd want it to be
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a cabin type home rather than a
 	
 	
 		oh rather than your personal residence
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah rather than something i went to every day and i and i would want it on a different setting than you know a row of houses it's
 	
 	
 		something
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's beautiful inside but it to me it looks just a bit out of place
 	
 	
 		yeah we've got a person that wants to build a log cabin in this neighborhood and we have some uh protective covenants
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and they've really got into kind of some well it's kind of been a messy situation it's
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		actually gotten down to lawsuits and these are people that are you know
 	
 	
 		oh has it
 	
 	
 		in
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 	
 	
 		see each other every Sunday at church and then they're suing each other it's not it's not a good situation
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		
 
 		oh dear  now why did they want to build a log they just that's what they prefer huh
 	
 	
 		well it's it's a a single gal that uh well she's divorced and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh think they have they're pretty actually uh good price per square foot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh think she's thinking that would be a good economical way to get a get the home that she likes at
 	
 	
 		oh oh that's yeah because apparently they save quite a bit when you put them together from the kit or or however they come
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i i'm not sure
 		it's it's been a really controversy a controversy
 	
 	
 		oh dear so is she going to be able to build to build it do you think
 	
 	
 		not so far no because the the restrictive covenants provide to the
 	
 	
 		not so far
 	
 	
 		one of the uh covenants is uh curiously enough uh that it has to be in harmony with the existing structures
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so when the you know when the copy  it doesn't look like the other homes it kind that's one thing item that has to occur in our neighborhood
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		huh well that is interesting
 	
 	
 		we have to have uh a lot of uh
 		
 
 		if you don't have uh brick on it for example they're a little bit hard on you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		like you have a certain amount brick and a certain amount uh some other material siding or
 	
 	
 		does it have to be uh a certain square footage or a certain price
 	
 	
 		stucco
 		uh i think there is a minimum square footage i'm not sure what it is
 	
 	
 		is there
 		oh we've we've been looking around at different pieces of land and have found a a couple that that had the minimum square footage
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know requirement but um
 		huh that's interesting that the other houses along our road are like you say some are ramblers and some are the two story so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but ours ours is the smallest one on the road
 		
 
 	
 	
 		ours is you know our subdivision is really only about seventy homes
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh our street is uh the nicest homes are on our street i will say that not uh being boastful but i think our street does have the nicer homes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		we border uh
 		well just on the other side the houses across our street uh from ours are the probably the nicer homes because they border on the golf course and they have a creek that runs through their backyard
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh
 	
 	
 		that is nice now did you build you built yours
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah we've been in it six years
 	
 	
 		oh oh did you do the contracting yourself or did you hire a contractor or
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		we had a contractor come and do that uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i really don't know much about home construction i well i know a little bit i did a little bit of work in summer in summer sometimes just doing some framing but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know when you got a full time job and a family you really don't have the time
 	
 	
 		that's right it takes it takes did you finish your basement yourself or
 	
 	
 		no i haven't finished it yet
 	
 	
 		oh you haven't finished it
 	
 	
 		but see our upstairs has four bedrooms
 	
 	
 		oh you don't need it yet then do you
 	
 	
 		we we really haven't had occasion to
 		to to need it so
 	
 	
 		to need it
