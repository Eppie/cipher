 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		do you rely on newspapers or TV or what for your current events
 	
 	
 		well uh mostly the radio i listen to the radio i'm home during the day and so i have the radio going and listen to the news there and then uh
 		i watch the news on TV at night we have a local newspaper that we subscribe to but that's
 		um all the newspaper my husband and i used to take the the Wall Street Journal and that had a lot of good information
 	
 	
 		are you in Salt Lake City
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we're fifty miles north
 	
 	
 		so you're a suburb of it then
 	
 	
 		right right so we don't take the Salt Lake newspaper how about
 	
 	
 		okay
 		we have we have in Dallas what's called talk radio
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and it's news twenty four hours a day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you don't listen to it twenty four hours
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if you're in the car for twenty minutes in traffic you sure get a bunch of news real quick
 	
 	
 		get caught up on it fast
 	
 	
 		so you primarily rely on on the radio
 	
 	
 		right
 		right yes and we have um the station we listen to is out of Kansas or out of Salt Lake City and it's an all news or an all talk station also it doesn't have the
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		the music and thing so
 	
 	
 		do you have where these people call in express their opinions and talk back
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah same thing down here it's uh really gets some really neat information that way don't we
 	
 	
 		uh right get a lot of different different viewpoints  have you
 	
 	
 		i definitely take the morning newspaper and read the headlines of every morning and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and that helps keep up on too how about magazines do you take any magazines
 	
 	
 		i
 		at the office
 		nothing newsworthy uh uh National Geographic Reader's Digest
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh i'm afraid we're probably reliant on newspapers and radio
 	
 	
 		right that
 	
 	
 		television news i'm not interested in their in them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right that you don't like the television news the television reports
 	
 	
 		uh no i don't uh especially in depth things like 60 Minutes
 	
 	
 		but
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or or whatever else they call i think they're very biased
 	
 	
 		they are right presents one viewpoint and not the other
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh
 		journalistic uh they'll go into some guy's office with TV cameras rolling and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because he sticks up his hand doesn't want to be seen he's considered he's supposed to be considered guilty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they're charging they're making a man look guilty before he's even given a chance to hear his side of the story but
 	
 	
 		well you know i think there's a lot of that in the newspaper reporting too i  because a lot and i don't know how much of what we read is is really accurate a few of the stories that
 	
 	
 		definitely
 	
 	
 		that you know i've been personably person known what's going on and then you read what's in the newspaper about it and it doesn't always match up
 		so
 	
 	
 		you really wonder what you hear from this Russia thing that going on is is Yeltsin all that great you know is he really going to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it sounds as more and more came out that he and what's his name is gone now
 	
 	
 		um-hum Gorbachev yeah
 	
 	
 		Gorbachev Gorbachev got into a political quarrel about three years ago and uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		Gorbachev just got beat to the punch politically
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i mean even with a guy Gorbachev goes to his office to clean out his desk for the next day and Yeltsin is already there sitting there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh that's ugly
 	
 	
 		uh it is and and like you say we really i'm really not sure how much of what we hear is reliable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we uh my family and i went out we have a golden spike
 		um railroad
 		monument oh it's probably about fifty miles from here and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		last Friday we went out there to watch the train come in the steam engine and there was uh there was a probably a group of
 		oh maybe fifty to seventy five people out there and the newspaper reporter was there and he took a picture and it was in the paper the next day and it
 	
 	
 		hundreds
 	
 	
 		well just the opposite they probably had oh ten people in the picture and he said
 		um just a small group had turned out to watch the steam engine come in and the way it was printed and the way the picture was it looked like that was all there was was right there when there was
 	
 	
 		i'll be dad gummed
 	
 	
 		quite quite a few more there you know so
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i think you have to be careful when when we take in the information what we take as truth and what we don't
 	
 	
 		we lost the second major newspaper in Dallas within this month
 	
 	
 		oh i read that
 	
 	
 		the Dallas Times Herald went under we were one of the few
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 	
 	
 		few cities remaining big cities that had two papers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and we're sorry now you got the Fort Worth Press and uh uh no Fort Worth Star Telegram The Press went years ago and the Dallas Mourning News and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 		oh was it financial trouble that's what they went under for wasn't it
 	
 	
 		yep yep competition killed them and and then well the Morning News finally bought out the the Herald
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yes oh well that's that's too bad which one did did you subscribe to that one
 	
 	
 		of course closed it down
 		
 
 		but
 		oh i've been with the Dallas Morning News for twenty years
 	
 	
 		oh ah
 	
 	
 		it is the conservative paper and i'm probably lean to being conservative as opposed to liberal so and the other was kind of the liberal paper so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh oh
 		oh huh well that
 	
 	
 		so i feel sorry for all the liberals in town they have to read the good stuff now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yes well that's i think Tom and i think um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the children
