 		uh i used to do more when our children are were younger we'd go we'd go for a week and and have uh stay up in the mountains it was really fun
 	
 	
 		well in in the mountains up in Utah or where
 	
 	
 		well in Idaho and we have camped a lot in Utah too but mostly in Idaho
 		we're right we're only about fifty miles from the Idaho border so we've camped there a lot do you camp a lot
 	
 	
 		well i go camping a lot with the Boy Scouts
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we do we do several types uh we do several types of camping one type of camping we do is called a
 		Base Camp where we simply go to camp set it up and spend the weekend the second type of camping we do is backpacking where we simply go to an area backpack in
 		spend a night or two and then backpack out and then a third type of camping we do has to do with uh aquatics
 	
 	
 		aquatics
 	
 	
 		well canoeing for the most part we we we take a long
 	
 	
 		oh um-hum
 	
 	
 		trip every June on the Buffalo River in Arkansas for about nine days of canoeing
 	
 	
 		is that with older scouts then
 	
 	
 		uh no the scouts have to have achieved the rank of First Class which they generally get done after a year and then they're eligible to go on the trip
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so we'll have boys on the trip that'll they all should be twelve by the time we go all ranging all the way up to seventeen
 	
 	
 		oh yes i have five boys that are  Eagles so they've done a lot of camping too and they've they've uh one thing they've done is gone on a fifty mile hike
 	
 	
 		well  these hikes that we've taken our boys
 		uh generally are about six six to ten miles but uh they'll go they have the chance to go to Philmont in July and then they'll do the fifty mile or whatever hiking then
 	
 	
 		oh oh well our camping is just with the family we've well  part of the time we've been in trailers and part of the time we've been in tents
 		but uh we've uh and then when we've we've been camping we floated down the Buffalo River in Idaho and done things like that
 	
 	
 		you have you have a Buffalo River up there too huh
 	
 	
 		in Idaho uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i wonder if they're connected to the one in Arkansas
 	
 	
 		oh i would doubt it i think this empties into the Bear River
 	
 	
 		well we do some family camping too where we just all go for a weekend but we only have time to do that a few times a year because the scouts go camping
 	
 	
 		you sound like you're a very active Scout Master
 	
 	
 		well assistant at the moment
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh but we're very we're very busy because we go camping every month except February and and then in July the boys either go to regular camp or to Philmont
 		and the other months we all go camping
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 		where's Philmont
 	
 	
 		uh Philmont's up near your end of the woods
 	
 	
 		i've heard of it before
 	
 	
 		it's in the uh i don't know exactly where it is but it's somewhere in the Montana
 		Montana Wyoming area
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but we we have boys that'll go there in July and they'll go up there for a week or two
 	
 	
 		our our son that's our youngest son uh went to a camp called Life
 		and it was up in uh and that's been a fantastic deal they really put out on their own and they're not they can't go until they're seventeen or eighteen but they're put out on their own and they just have to survive camping
 	
 	
 		here you can go to Philmont but you have to be thirteen as of January first of the year you want to go which is in July so most of the boys that go are at least fourteen
 	
 	
 		oh well that sounds exciting does uh do you have uh children that are scouts
 	
 	
 		well i have one son that's a scout
 	
 	
 		oh how many children do you have
 	
 	
 		i have also a daughter she's a Girl Scout
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		they don't do as much camping
 	
 	
 		oh well our our family really enjoys camping they the boys will even we live in along the Wasatch  and they'll go up the mountains just above our house and camp
 	
 	
 		well i'm afraid the nearest mountains to us are several uh hours away
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a son in Plano that we visit all the time
 	
 	
 		well that's why they call it Plano because it's just plain
 	
 	
 		it's terrible
 	
 	
 		it's plain you can from my office on a clear day i can see Fort Worth which is about thirty five miles away
