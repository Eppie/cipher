 		i've never seen that

 		how about you
 	
 	
 		um
 		i like LA Law
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		not because it's realistic but  it's entertaining
 	
 	
 		yeah i do like that occasionally i'll see that one
 	
 	
 		um
 		let's see i watch Cheers sometimes
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		and mostly just movies when there's a good movie on actually when there isn't a good movie on too i just like to have the TV on if you know if i'm home alone or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		have either the radio or the TVs got to be on  at all times

 		i've well i've been home with a um i have a baby and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i'll i'll watch a soap occasionally
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		do you watch any of those
 	
 	
 		i well i don't because i work all day but um i probably i usually do if i'm home for a couple of days like you know around Christmas or whatever after a while i'll start watching it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then um for a while i'll ask people if they know what happened and then i'll just forget it
 	
 	
 		oh what what what ones do you get into
 	
 	
 		oh i don't even remember the last time i watched was back in college it was like General Hospital or something
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i maybe watched it for a week
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but um i know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around those you know they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera
 	
 	
 		how funny funny oh yeah oh i don't get into them that much
 	
 	
 		it was i mean
 	
 	
 		when when i'm home sometimes in the day i'll
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'll watch them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but yeah uh oh i i was really trying to think i don't even know if there's any other shows that i watch real
 	
 	
 		well you said you have kids how old
 	
 	
 		oh i have a six year old and i have a um he'll be a year old in January
 	
 	
 		so you're you aren't a Sesame Street fan
 	
 	
 		well  they do they watch it my six year old's kind of he's outgrown that one a little bit but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby and he's kind of he's entertained by it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so yes i i do watch that one on occasion
 	
 	
 		supposed to be a great babysitter
 	
 	
 		yeah well they're not entertained for too long with it he's he's still too little but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i do turn that on
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and i i do like um Donahue sometimes i watch that i think he has some interesting things on it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i know which what time is that on i never see it
 	
 	
 		um that's on at let's see it's on at four
 	
 	
 		oh okay i'm not home then that's why i don't see it
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll watch that occasionally he's got some real
 		i don't know there's some real weird people that he seems to come up with
 	
 	
 		well isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange
 	
 	
 		uh yes yes oh yeah but he he does have some real bizarre things i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		golly other than that i don't know i
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		guess i'm not much of a TV person really
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess it wasn't a real good topic for us but  well tell me is it snowing up there
 	
 	
 		um no um it snowed a little bit um probably about four days ago and
 	
 	
 		no
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas
 	
 	
 		wow but do you have snow on the ground now oh well that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah there is snow on the ground
 		i i wish it would snow a little bit more but i've heard it's raining there
 	
 	
 		oh gosh we've broken all sorts of records they've got i mean we still have some highways closed and it stopped raining almost twenty four hours ago
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		but um oh just phenomenal i mean i you know you see it on the news all the time but until you've really seen it it does it doesn't really hit you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i was driving home from work Friday and i saw there were some stop signs i mean submerged up to the writing on the stop sign
 		and that was just it was amazing to me
 	
 	
 		oh goodness
 		oh jeez so so there has been some flooding and
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh there's been a lot yeah it's it's too bad but you know the thing is that this happens in the last three years it's happened at least once a year if not twice
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's awful
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the people continue to move back in the flood zones so
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		i don't know i mean you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't think i would
 	
 	
 		oh boy well
 	
 	
 		because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood
 	
 	
 		yeah oh what a mess well now do you work for T I oh do you oh uh-huh huh yeah i know this has been an interesting thing to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i do yeah
 		have you made a lot of calls or
 	
 	
 		um i've i've probably talked to maybe just five people my my husband uh is doing it too he's had a few more than me and but it's been real interesting and kind of fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
