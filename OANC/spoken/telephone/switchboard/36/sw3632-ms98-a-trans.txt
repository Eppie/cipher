 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you take magazines
 	
 	
 		well the only one i get right now is the Journal and i'm really kind of tired of it because it comes out on the newsstand before i ever get it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i don't think i'm gonna subscribe to it anymore
 	
 	
 		oh i really enjoy the magazines i take i take several uh or i take two through the church and then i take uh Reader's Digest National Geographic Geographic and Better Homes and Gardens and McCall's
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh hm Redbook
 	
 	
 		oh that's a lot i like Redbook i'm i never would have time to read all those magazines most of the time when i grab one i'm at the airport
 	
 	
 		oh do you travel a lot
 	
 	
 		i do i travel a lot and i just usually will do that you know grab one then and that's about the only time i read them so sometimes i'll pick one up because it looks good and i don't even get to see it so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh well i i um
 		uh i work volunteer at the hospital and a lot of times i'll take them in there and go through them and pick out the articles i like and and read them but i really enjoy the magazines i don't i really don't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		read them as much as i would like to but i  do like to pick them up and go through them especially if they're National Geographic and Reader's Digest i really enjoy those two
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well Reader's Digest is always a good magazine it's always great it's got lots of different things in but as far as the articles go i just find we go round and round on the same things an awful lot so i'm just sort of tired of that and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		well if the only time you read them is at the airport i can see why
 	
 	
 		yeah and i prefer to read a book i really do i like to do that better
 	
 	
 		um-hum well you must be you must have a job then
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		you must have a you must be employed
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i'm a nurse and and i work float and so i work lots of days and lots of hours and different times and so
 	
 	
 		oh are you
 		oh
 		you don't have time to read then oh you you said you like a book better
 	
 	
 		yeah i do
 	
 	
 		i read books too but i read them at night before i go to bed
 	
 	
 		well i read about one page and then i'm asleep so i don't get very far at night that way and i guess with the holidays and all i haven't even picked up a book or a magazine in about a month but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh uh-huh
 		oh oh we have a son that fies flies for American Airlines he's a
 	
 	
 		oh does he really
 	
 	
 		he's a pilot um-hum we have another son that's a doctor too but anyway i but when i wake up in the night and can't go back to sleep a lot of times i read and my husband has been really good about that
 	
 	
 		ah
 		yeah yeah that's good
 	
 	
 		because i i do enjoy reading a lot but i'm not employed outside of the home either so i
 	
 	
 		so that gives you a little more time to do that yeah i i have an application in with American right now for flight attendant actually so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that's what i would like to do
 	
 	
 		oh he sure enjoys it
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i was married to someone who worked for American and i miss having my flight privileges
 	
 	
 		boy we would too because we've got kids all over the world
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and and it's just really you know i've got friends all over the world so if i ever want to see them again i need to get me a job at the airlines and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've always wanted to fly so with my nursing background i'm hoping that i will be able to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we'll see but American is the best so  trying to hold out for that
 	
 	
 		oh he sure thinks  he sure thinks so i saw by the paper today that they're going to lay off a thousand
 		two hundred people though but it's mostly going to be ground crew so
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah
 	
 	
 		and my son is a pilot too so he'll be okay i
 	
 	
 		he'll be okay yeah yeah i've heard that they were expecting some layoffs but
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		oh don't you have time to read when you are at work
 	
 	
 		no never  no i don't even have time to go to lunch
 	
 	
 		it's busy huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we grab lunch on the floor we bring our lunch and we spend ten minutes where we can and we're busy most all the time there are days when you know we can kick back but then we sort of visit
