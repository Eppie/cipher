 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i don't know what kind of exercise do you get involved in
 	
 	
 		well i basically do the Nautilus i work out at the Y um three times a week and um then i try to walk in between times
 		so and i've found and i at the Y i ride a stationary bike and then i um and sometimes i will do Stairmaster and then then i use the Nautilus equipment and uh i basically like it a lot uh
 		i've been doing it about a year and a half and and i really i really enjoy it i particularly like the machines um that that seems to have worked real well for me and then i do like to walk that's that's my um
 		other exercise that i like to do so and you know i see i feel like i feel a lot better since i've uh started doing that seems to help me a lot
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i i used to run i ran for about twenty years but it takes  wear and tear on the joints so couple couple years ago i switched over to stationary bike and i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i do about fifty miles a week on a a stationary bike for to keep my lower body developed and then i work out three times a week with uh weights at home to
 		you know keep the upper part of shoulders and you know arms that sort of thing
 		so that seems between the two of them it's seems to keep me i guess fairly fit
 	
 	
 		and you work out at home then
 	
 	
 		yeah basically i have i have a stationary bike at home have some weights at home that i use and then you know i try to supplement it periodically with you know some walking what have you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah my husband uh ran for a while but it was just too hard on his knees he he just felt like it did his knees in
 		so he went to um he walks and or does Stairmaster um you know depending on his schedule and the weather um but he felt like that was just too hard on his joints too so he he
 	
 	
 		uh the the running was just too hard on both my knees and my hips and the um stationary bike keeps you toned and is keeps the stress off of the joints
 	
 	
 		right right
 		well we um the the place where i work out has just gotten all new equipment so i'm trying to get used to adjust adjusting to the new equipment but i do like it it it uh it seems to um
 		do certain muscles much better i think it um
 		you know works you out in a better place it doesn't uh bother your my back as much and but i it's hard it's like now you have to adjust to all this new stuff and it there's a lot of adjusting of each individual piece of equipment
 		so i i'm in the process of trying to um  get adjusted to it but i think i'm going to like it um because it just isolates muscles so much better than the other
 	
 	
 		well i guess they went out and bought all that equipment just to keep you on your toes huh
 	
 	
 		yeah  i think well luckily the Y here i live real close to the Y in Plano and uh they are getting ready for major expansion so
 		they're going to they're just going to open up we're going to have bigger rooms and and more room to work out then they've got new weights and and all this stuff so i go to the Y with a friend and that seems to help me stay motivated to to continue to work out
 	
 	
 		well i i just do the self motivation i can do my fifty miles a week on the bike that's four times a week and then the three times the weights some days i do both and then some days it's one or the other just depending on how it goes i know
 		on the weights and the bicycle like you know even even yesterday on Christmas day i was on the i did the the weights for a while and the bicycle but today i just do the bicycle because i can do the bicycle a couple of days in a row but the weights you have to do those every other day so
 	
 	
 		right now now do you watch television or do you just sit there and bicycle
 	
 	
 		um usually when i'm bicycling i listen to the uh listen to the radio uh just turn on some music and listen to the radio when i bike and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		same thing while i'm using the weights and sometimes i'll
 		watch the news or whatever most of the time i'll just listen to the radio though
 	
 	
 		now do you bike when you say fifty miles that's total a week
 	
 	
 		yeah um i do it in four thirty minute sessions
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so each each time i do it
 		it it's roughly twelve and a half miles per session and then i do four of those and that sums up being fifty miles
 	
 	
 		i see um-hum
 		um-hum and what kind of a bike do you have what kind of stationary bike do you use
 	
 	
 		uh i don't even remember the name of it any more
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but
 	
 	
 		but it it works pretty good it measures you know it measures your your pulse and and and your miles per hour and calories expended and you know it has levels of difficulty from one through nine and so forth but i don't even remember the name of it any more
 	
 	
 		well the bikes i've used at the Y one of them i can't remember what they are right at the moment either but the the old ones were you pedalled sort of downward you know you were basically sitting pretty much like a standard
