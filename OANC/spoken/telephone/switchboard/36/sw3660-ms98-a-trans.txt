 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay all set then
 		uh what do you think about it
 	
 	
 		uh i think it's a real good concept uh drug testing procedures would have to be refined
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		from what i've seen on the news  there's a a a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in uh drug testing
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't realize that
 	
 	
 		yeah um there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their uh test but they didn't know for sure what it was but it was a drug so they got turned down
 		and uh turns out it was a prescription
 		or people getting somebody else's blood test
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		same sort of problem that happens sometimes with these some of these uh like AIDS tests and such
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um-hum yeah that's right i have heard uh  i don't remember what they call it sort of like a
 		positive negatives or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh
 		a positive indication of drugs but there's not really there weren't really any there uh every now and then there's an error and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i work here at Texas Instruments so uh we we do a let me think do we yeah everyone coming in i guess i did three years ago
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		everyone coming in uh goes through the drug testing procedure and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they talk about it as a  you know as as better for the country and better for the working conditions uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if they uh they test for drugs i i'm i can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore i know we did in the military but i don't know if once your in they continue to do it but i guess you're always on call for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah i not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart and about a year and a half ago they instituted a uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a uh drug testing program uh well drug and alcohol testing program it's it's not a random  through the system as each employee comes in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		part of the hiring procedure is a a blood test  um
 		but and uh i think the big problem though is is they send these  off to large labs
 	
 	
 		in my
 		uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		and then they have thousands and thousands of the samples that uh going through it in a day and
 		bottles get mixed up and things like that  a potential for inaccuracy
 	
 	
 		so your big beef with it is the uh
 		is is it's a good idea but
 		like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better or make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever yeah i i i tend to agree with you David
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah my brother uh my brother used to work for Wal-Mart and then i don't know if he still does or what because i don't know if Sam's is actually part of it but he you know is working at Sam's now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah Sam's is part of Wal-Mart
 	
 	
 		okay yeah then he's been working for the company for a while too yeah he enjoys it good company um you all uh have some his
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		the company i thought was a great place to work
 	
 	
 		telling me about good profit sharing and all that so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's good news
 	
 	
 		yeah they got to have had two or three years in with them then you start buying stock and you have a have a little taken out of your check each each payday to put against uh uh stock portfolio uh not portfolio just you know against Wal-Mart stock
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what my brother was telling me that's good good news good deal well uh how long were we supposed i haven't done this in a couple months how long were we supposed to discuss for
 	
 	
 		uh you're supposed to get five minutes
 	
 	
 		okay we got a couple more minutes then i guess  uh think what else i can say about that um
 	
 	
 		um
 		do you have any idea uh
 		let's see were you were you were tested for drugs as you got into uh as as you got into TI
 	
 	
 		right um everyone coming in gets goes through the drug test
 	
 	
 		yeah uh now uh were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through or
 	
 	
 		uh no well let me think about that yeah it was after i was i had already been hired um yeah you get hired then you come in the first i
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		seems to me i remember that uh i was hired came in and went through some orientation and i thought i
 		boy i can't remember that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test maybe it was during the interview i came up a couple times for an interview so it's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened
 		but uh i guess just like other companies other friends i've been hearing about that have been moving around it's it's before they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment so i'm sure that happened to me too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		what what about oh they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart so
 	
 	
 		yeah they they it was after i was already working there and they weren't testing any of those that were already working so
 	
 	
 		right
 		right yeah i wasn't
