 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh what do you feel about the nursing homes would you put an elderly relative in one
 	
 	
 		um only if i had to
 	
 	
 		that's the way i feel right now i'm uh concerned with both the sister-in-law and the
 		and the mother that i'm uh uh you know one of them will said if anything happens send me there and the other one says please don't send me there
 	
 	
 		yeah it's real hard on both the family and the people i mean
 	
 	
 		yes yes it is it's hard my mother uh well i have four sisters or three sisters and my mother takes turn staying with us and you know she's getting to the point that
 		that i'm worried about her needing more care than we can offer her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh she can't she it's hard for her to get up and down stairs and everything and i just think what are we going to do
 	
 	
 		yeah well how old is she
 	
 	
 		uh eighty five
 	
 	
 		i see yeah well um would like if do you think you're gonna have to it's gonna come to that
 	
 	
 		so
 		i hope not i we will we will do everything in our power not for it to
 		happen so i i'm hoping that we can take care of her till you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i went through this with both my grandmothers we had to get someone to look after them but we were lucky and we found someone to look after them in their home we didn't have to put them in a home
 	
 	
 		well mother uh mother lived about fifty miles from me and a hundred miles and five hundred miles from the other sisters and so if she if someone could've stayed close by she could've stayed in her home longer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but as it was uh she had to come and start living with us and and she gets more dependent all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah well my great grandmother that we had to put in a nursing home because it got to where my grandmother couldn't take care of her she after they put her in there with i mean she deteriorated i mean her health really got worse after
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i think that happens yeah i think they just give up then
 	
 	
 		after she would yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and another thing what  what would you do if you had to what would you look for
 	
 	
 		well that's um i guess references or whatever from other people first of all and then
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i mean all the you'd have to check i think all the licensing that they go through
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i would check on cleanliness and another thing i'd check on is the food
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my sister-in-law was in in one and uh she just just had her hip replaced
 		and so she just went to one you know for the little time for it to exercise and thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they'd feed them really weird things like  uh salad for breakfast and broccoli and she was she had her facilities about her and she didn't i mean she knew that they were doing it wrong
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i think they're
 	
 	
 		yeah see that's what it is is most of the people are so old in there that they don't really know what's going on
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think that they can get away with that
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's a problem too so
 	
 	
 		you have to i think you have to really check into them real closely and then even after you put someone in there then you would wanna
 	
 	
 		i do too and i
 	
 	
 		be you know be able to check up on them on a weekly basis just to make sure that they were treating them properly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well the one that i that i we would put my mother in would be about three miles from my home
 	
 	
 		oh that wouldn't be too bad
 	
 	
 		and so i would check her to i mean she was in there when she had her her hip replaced too
 		and so i would check on her two or three times a day
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a scary thought
 	
 	
 		they
 		it is it is and you just you know well it comes right down to it i think it'd be heartbreaking how old was your grandmother when you put her in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think she was like my great grandmother was about she was i think ninety two
 	
 	
 		your great grandmother
 		oh my word and how old you have a longevity don't you in your family
 	
 	
 		yeah one of my girlfriends her her great grandmother is a hundred and two but she still lives at home with her with her family or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh that's great yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah no it's a it's a tough decision it's a tough decision to put to put them in there and then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what
 		oh it is and it and it you know it's a tough decision to take them into your home when you're used to your freedom
 	
 	
 		um-hum but just it's a lot of responsibility
 	
 	
 		yeah it is and and uh you know uh well it's just like having a child again do you have children oh
 	
 	
 		no ma'am
 	
 	
 		oh you're just a youngster then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh oh well i don't think we've solved any great problems but i wish  what
 	
 	
 		no what um trying to think what else
 		we went through oh and then the medication if they have to have medication that's another thing that that i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you never really know and you never really feel confident with anything unless you're actually doing it yourself and if they're at a home you don't know that they're being given their medicine
 	
 	
 		right right and not and uh my mother's on insulin and i think you know just giving her the right amount checking her blood and giving her the right amount
 	
 	
 		they
 	
 	
 		and then again back to the food i think that they have uh
 		if they don't eat if they don't eat by themselves or if they don't want like what's that served that day they don't eat it and i think a lot of them starve to death
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they just wither away and
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of like you know you put them in there someone else so someone else can take care of them and then you really wonder you can't feel really confident that they're being taken care of
 	
 	
 		no no i don't i i just think the solution if every  but a lot of people can't either can't take care of them at home
 	
 	
 		what
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		you know if you're working and i i think the ideal situation is like with your grandmother have someone come into their home and live with them and take care of them and a lot of people like to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
