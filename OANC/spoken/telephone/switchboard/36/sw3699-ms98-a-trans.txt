 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh do you live in a home
 	
 	
 		yes we we it's a house we bought uh about two and a half years ago now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		oh did you uh-huh we've we've lived in ours for about six years we had it built actually and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the first house
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's our first home too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh so what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to
 	
 	
 		yeah huh
 	
 	
 		to renting somebody else's
 	
 	
 		um well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in and um that was quite an experience
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i much prefer having my own home and and uh just the space and and more privacy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you have is it a fairly large house
 	
 	
 		um it's uh oh it's like twenty four fifty square feet it's a two story yeah how about yours
 	
 	
 		oh that's a pretty good size yeah uh-huh
 		it's tiny  it's not much bigger actually we had an apartment two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is so yeah it's uh it's only like eleven hundred square feet
 	
 	
 		is it small
 		oh really
 		oh uh-huh do you do you have children
 	
 	
 		just one yeah but it it uh all the rooms are small i i mean but it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted yeah and uh use an extra one for an office
 	
 	
 		just one huh oh
 		oh uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		which is handy i'd rather have have more rooms and less space in each one i guess rather have lots of rooms and lots lots of space but uh that ends up costing me
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah well like um how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they're the it's pretty typical i mean it's it's a very very middle class neighborhood uh lots of lots of young couples with you know usually oh i'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that's their first homes and uh
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		lots of kids and and stuff and so it it fits well in the neighborhood it's it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood but on the other hand it's clean and kind of suburban
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		little bit more than i want
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		is is yours also pretty much in conformance with a neighborhood or is it
 	
 	
 		um yeah it it it it does it it seems about oh probably average um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that our neighborhood has a just a wide variety of of um people and you know there's older people here and and um
 		people that are about our age we're in our thirties and um there's a lot of kids a lot of kids people the people across the street have eight
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh wow eight kids oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh yeah their home just burned down matter of fact and um last summer and they're just rebuilding and um their house is going to be really big  they're
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		i'm sure with eight gosh
 	
 	
 		yeah they're building it up bigger he's at um uh oh not an obstetrician an an orthopedic surgeon and um so since the house did burn they're they're going it's quite different than it was before and it's it's a lot bigger
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um but ours is about it's you know it's a nice nice home it's it's definitely not one of the the smaller ones and um it's not the biggest either but
 	
 	
 		yeah neighborhoods i mean they'll they'll they'll tend to to be real tight about that uh especially newer neighborhoods my my brother just built a new house uh um he he lives in Wichita Kansas
 		and the um
 		uh the neighborhood actually fought him on it because he he was um the house was gonna cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		now that's because he was he's doing a lot of it himself and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff and his house actually ends up being nicer than lots of other in the neighborhood but but they were they were pretty touchy on it he was a little surprised
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you
 		you know that's interesting you say that because we do have we have those architectural codes here and when we um put our house in um they wanted us to have there was one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we have part siding it on on the two story part and then on the back and they there was one side where our chimney was and just the chimney was gonna be brick and they wanted us to have more brick so we ended up having to go halfway up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which it does look nicer and you know we would have liked to have had all brick but of course at that point we couldn't afford it and
 		but it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all so it's kind of like they were
 	
 	
 		right
 		kind of depends on when they get in you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and i and so it was kind of like it's they ours is the last street that they built on so the houses actually on our street are a little bit they've kind of gone a little bit nicer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh they have it's got yeah yeah oh
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean just they you know it's like the second phase and and so they've kind of changed the the codes a little bit and so that's kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hum
 		well my see my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they they moved into a neighborhood and bought a a real nice stone house down in in South Austin and um
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and  what the builder apparently plans to do is they they do phase one and they they kind of give it a very upscale and and very tightly controlled um codes and and and stuff and then they come back in and and and then they sell
