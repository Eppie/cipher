 
     		
 	
 		and women's place in the workplace huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh to quote my father a woman's place is in the stove
 		i have to disagree my wife works  say what what do you do
 	
 	
 		oh i disagree i disagree
 		yeah so do i so do i
 		um i'm a lab tech
 	
 	
 		are you
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		well i guess as far as roles in the workplace they've uh they've made some you know pretty serious uh ground in the last thirty forty years
 	
 	
 		that right they've generally increased considerably
 	
 	
 		uh my sister is a she's a medical professional
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and you know she says that in in in order to get paid the same as a man you have to do twice the work
 	
 	
 		yeah see i can
 	
 	
 		but fortunately it's not that tough
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well yeah that i can see that i can see that  i i i do think that uh um higher positions like administrative more often go to the man than they do the woman
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah i i'll grant you that
 	
 	
 		but hopefully that'll change soon
 	
 	
 		well it hasn't been true of any of my companies
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah because the only women that i hire are ones that are capable
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if they're capable they can do anything they wanna do
 	
 	
 		right well i work for a private laboratory and and when it's a small company you see where you're you're kind of overstepped because you are a woman and but i think uh it i think it's starting to change
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well i hope so i really do
 	
 	
 		yes i do too considering i am a woman
 	
 	
 		yeah well for your sake sure but uh i think that as long as
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the uh American society is inundated as it is by the commercial market you know the
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		television's commercials in particular uh  progress is gonna be rather rapid but shaping role models is gonna be a problem
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because you know they don't wanna rock the boat with anybody
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and you know i don't know how you perceive life but i know that people are prejudiced and they bigoted and they carry their their convictions all the way to the bone no matter what  they say
 	
 	
 		right right right
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i'm the first one well i flunked the the MCP test big time
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		you know what that is
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		oh  a man and his son were driving along the road in a convertible
 		and they have a car wreck and the the father's killed
 		and the boy is rushed to the emergency room and the doctor walks in looks down says i can't operate on him that's my son
 	
 	
 		all right the that was his mother
 	
 	
 		all right you passed
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		believe me it's not that easy for a lot of men to understand that
 	
 	
 		i yeah i can yeah i can see that i can see that
 	
 	
 		yeah and i have a woman doctor  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really  isn't that strange i have a man doctor
 	
 	
 		really well actually we go to Doctor Garcia's office we started going with him soon as he got done with his residency
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he was a guy at the emergency room when we went there and then when he got his office well we just you know stayed with him and he's hired this other lady and uh my sister says that she's a better doctor
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know you know  i see doctor once every six months you know
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well that's what that i think that's one place that you know the roles of women are changing you don't see um
 		uh you well you see a lot more women in medical profession higher up as in doctors and everything i know several that are are pathologists and forensic pathologists and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know used to you didn't see that or hear of it at all
 	
 	
 		yeah well getting into medical school is no no mean trick either
 	
 	
 		right that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh as far as a you know the the the role of women in the workplace i think Texas has come remarkably far considering considering the  the high density of rednecks that there are around
 	
 	
 		oh yeah isn't that true isn't that true
 	
 	
 		i'm a i'm a transplant i'm you know we came from out of state
 	
 	
 		uh so did i
 	
 	
 		when i was very young but it was too late i was already formed
 	
 	
 		oh i came as an adult here
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know i was like uh i guess ten or eleven yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we came from uh a family that was
 		my mother is strong to say the least
 	
 	
 		did she work
 	
 	
 		um no not outside the home
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		no she was a she went to college and you know correspondence courses and whatnot but my parents were in my dad was in the Air Force
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and all the time that uh you know he was in the Air Force well she's never had to work
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know he always provided the the financial support but she has worked uh therapeutically you know she something to do
