 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you're in a little different situation i think we're going to set the record in Dallas this year for murders
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yes uh
 	
 	
 		there's been a lot
 	
 	
 		yes uh the uh and they're mostly drug linked here but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we have
 		
 
 		um i really i think we had like four hundred and eighty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		more than one a day
 	
 	
 		my word is that an increase over any of the previous years is that the highest
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it just keeps going higher and higher we're going to have a we're going to set a record for us but possibly will be the deadliest place to live in the nation
 	
 	
 		my word
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		in the whole nation
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		wow that's terrible does that does that worry you at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		extremely i carry tear gas yeah
 	
 	
 		do you that's great do you are you out alone at night often or
 	
 	
 		that not for for that reason no
 	
 	
 		oh now does now is it mostly in certain areas that it happens or just
 	
 	
 		oh yes um you know crime is um
 		i think crimes against property are more common uh you know they're common fairly common all over uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know the some it's kind of funny uh we've just moved from a a low crime area because it's got great police to a higher crime area
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i had a i had a pickup truck sitting out by my house with uh all my furniture in it for a week and it wasn't touched
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		my word huh
 	
 	
 		so i don't know what you define as uh you know uh for being in an unsafe a less safe area
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's there no telling uh
 	
 	
 		my word huh well that i know that um we're a little bit in the same Salt Lake City is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		is about an hour away from us and they have had an increase a big increase in the number of murders this year too and they said that um
 		the murders have been on the rise where some of the other crimes have either stayed the same or declined but the more violent crimes like rapes and murders
 		have you know increased and i and i think like you said it's a lot linked to the drugs to the drug
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		scene and um of course the little community we live in we don't  have too many
 	
 	
 		you don't well you have it believe me but you might not you don't it's not as prevalent i don't
 	
 	
 		right right i'm sure that there's
 		uh we do have one policeman you know that that runs the
 		that is the law enforcement here and um
 	
 	
 		one
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we're real small and he's only been hired for about a year before that we didn't even have one
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how big what's the population
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i think there's a hundred and seventy families and i'm not sure
 		eight hundred maybe seven hundred seven hundred or eight hundred is the population
 	
 	
 		well the one person who might snort cocaine in town probably isn't very violent
 	
 	
 		so
 		no  no we do have um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		just up to the south of us there's an area called Docks Flat and it's up in the mountains and a lot of the the kids go up there for their beer parties and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know drugs and that and that's probably the biggest problem we have right here in the community is is these kids coming up up a canyon here and going up south for that kind of a thing and that brings a lot of
 	
 	
 		are they local
 	
 	
 		no no they're from
 		oh from the communities around us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		mostly so so they're not in town folks and that that brings in a lot of problems spots
 		but um have you ever been the victim of any type of a crime whether a burglary or
 	
 	
 		oh i had a i had a two eighty or three hundred Z X that uh i used to have the windows replaced on that that i say monthly three times though
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		they were stolen from i have three dogs three large barking fierce looking not fierce but fierce looking dogs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that um that sleep very soundly it would appear but uh just from my driveway
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh oh that's a good idea
 		that probably deters a lot of
 	
 	
 		oh well my truck i was telling you about was next to the dog pen
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh  that was probably the reason
 	
 	
 		but
 		i think it does but it's um that you know these are nice they don't they don't catch a lot of things
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i think if it's uh
 		if someone's coming to case your house and they knock on the door they're going to draw a response from the dogs but if someone walked around my house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		my dogs sleep so soundly during the day too that they wouldn't know
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh well do you um do you have signs posted that you know say
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got signs that say my house is protected by a security system
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		they're lies but you know
 	
 	
 		it might deter them well they say that that deters a lot a lot of would be you know burglaries
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that what's a what's a crime like there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		i'd probably have to go to one of the bigger
