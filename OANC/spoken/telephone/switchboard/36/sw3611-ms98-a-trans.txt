 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well
 		how do we feel about the nursing home right  um i have a dad eighty eighty nine years old and uh he has Parkinson's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and  there are three of us children my sister brother and i and we decided that we could not live with him going to a nursing home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so for two years we took turns my brother and i live here my sister lives in Longview going back and forth up there helping her she has him in her home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		we just decided we couldn't put him in the nursing homes but i decided i couldn't keep on with that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and now she won't put him in the nursing home i think she's getting close
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the problem with these nursing homes is  the cost
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um he has a house and
 		since he has a house it would cost oh i don't know something like two thousand dollars i think to keep him and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i really need to know more about it
 	
 	
 		yeah i think we're kind of my family's in the same situation my my grandmother
 		is about ninety two right now and just really has lost her senses she's gone senile and we basically take care of her between my uncle and aunt and ourselves and my uncle lives in in Utah so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's really it's a challenge for our family because my parents still have a lot of young kids and it's really tough for them to
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		to handle my grandma as well as
 		as well as um the rest of the family
 	
 	
 		yeah is she still mobile though
 	
 	
 		no not at all we're we basically push her around and she's lost control of her bowel and it's just it's really sad and it's kind of like you said that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		we've we've looked at some nursing homes and and just the situations that i've seen is most of the time when there are when they they go into the nursing homes they just lose even more than what they had before
 	
 	
 		right they become a vegetable more or less  and uh they don't they sedate them and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		forget them
 	
 	
 		yeah and really you know they say that they're going to help them be productive but basically what they all do is they lay on their beds all day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it just to me that seems really sad
 	
 	
 		well it really is um  my dad can't even feed himself  and um he still you know health is pretty his mind pretty much and that's why we can't put him there i guess if he didn't have his mind you know it would be easier to do that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but anyways
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of a challenge i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well hopefully  they're going to clean these things up i don't that they will
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i think you know i think they big thing is just to find a nursing home that really cares for other people and it's not just the money they're bringing in but it's it's more of a humanitarian thing where they want to help these people have the best years of their lives that are left
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i think that's the real problem personally
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess one problem that they're having in these homes is is help
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they don't have enough help to go around
 	
 	
 		yeah and see that's i couldn't do it i think that that'd be super tough just because the people that you learn to love you see dying off one by one and i think that would just be really i admire those who can i couldn't handle that personally
 	
 	
 		yeah  i have a friend here  that i think her mother's like ninety seven or something and um she's been pleased well pleased with the care of course she goes every day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think as long as you go every day to see about them they get better care
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you're right
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think as you learn to know the volunteers and help them know a little bit about your family i guess that would make a difference too
 	
 	
 		yeah right  well  i do you know anything about the um qualifications uh i mean of knowing qualifications of the nursing homes
 	
 	
 		i i really don't to be honest with you i'm just seen i've done some work in nursings homes and i've kind of
 		but in terms of specific qualifications i don't know other than three square meals a day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh fruit and supposed sanitation type things but
 		i just it seems like every time i've sung a lot and so every almost every Christmas and every holiday you can think of we've gone in and sang at nursing homes and
 		it's sad because really they're not and to me at least it doesn't seem like they're very well taken care of and any of them that
 	
 	
 		no no they're really not
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		and i think as long as they're is a family member to go in and see about them they get better care
 	
 	
 		yeah i tend to agree with that and i think more than anything for them that's important that if you're going to find a find some place where the people who are around them really and truly love them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they know that they're still wanted and they're still they can still be a productive part of society
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i think too often the nursing home for example my grandma's case she doesn't want to go to a nursing home because to her that's just a sign of losing everything and completely being completely unproductive forever
 	
 	
 		um-hum  well that's kind of the way my dad was when he had to leave his home he  he left my home and went to my sister's and of course you know as far as
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
