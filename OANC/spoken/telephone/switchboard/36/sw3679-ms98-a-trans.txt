 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which baseball team's your favorite
 	
 	
 		uh i don't really have a favorite baseball team but of course the Rangers play here
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and they've made a whole team history of trading away players that become all stars later on so
 	
 	
 		oh have they like who are some of their who are some of their players that they've traded away
 	
 	
 		uh several pitchers that Toby Harra and uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		Doc Meddich a another pitcher and of course now they've they've sunk all their money into Nolan Ryan so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		but they they they have they have Ruben Sierra and they have um
 		uh Julio Franco
 	
 	
 		oh so they've had some real good ones over the years
 	
 	
 		yeah and they they traded away um Incaviglia to Detroit i think and then he hit more home runs this year than he'd ever hit before
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh ah well that's good do they is is baseball for young kids there a big thing do they start them out early or where do they get all these good players from
 	
 	
 		uh no well they get them from you know Puerto Rico and Mexico and the minor leagues
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		the baseball baseball has a big minor league system
 		especially in a a few players come out of college and then uh more players um go straight to the minors
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that gives them time to see uh pitching at a higher speed you know and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		how do so do they have a a program at all for young kids there for baseball  or is soccer the biggest thing or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they do it's it's mostly in the schools the i think the biggest thing here is soccer
 	
 	
 		that's that's what i thought that soccer is bigger it used to be around here anyway that um baseball was real big for the young boys but now it it soccer is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		making a real quick catch up um i know they have the four and five year old kids start like with the tee ball
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		are you familiar with that at all
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		the tee ball and i think they go until they're seven then they have the pitching machine i think eight and nine and then and then just the regular pitching after that but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's not it's not a big as program as it as it used to be and i'm i'm not really familiar around here we don't have any baseball teams i don't think that even in Salt Lake City there is a
 	
 	
 		no there's not California's the nearest place
 	
 	
 		there's a
 		right right so it it's not there's no teams around here that i really follow and am close with have you ever played baseball
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh no just in P E uh it's it's pretty big here in high school and they've they've had several players um picked in the draft you know they they're picked in lower rounds
 	
 	
 		is it
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		especially pitchers
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh but mostly they just go on to college because because because they need the experience and the education so
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh right well that's i remember uh playing baseball when i was just in grade school but by the time you know we got to P E it it wasn't a real
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a real big thing either but i enjoy baseball just for a fun pastime now with you know a group gets together a family reunion or whatever or or it  we we live in a real small community and
 		they have uh like Fourth of July celebrations and people'll get together and play softball and
 		that's fun i really enjoy that i think it's a fun game i think it's funner to play than to watch myself
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		so do you do you enjoy playing it at all or do you enjoy watching it even
 	
 	
 		yeah i i um i enjoy playing and it took always took me we'd play you know during the spring semester always took me about six weeks before i could see the ball before i could hit the ball
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's do you
 	
 	
 		and
 		but i enjoy playing i enjoy uh watching the All-Star Game and the World Series was really good this year
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh
 	
 	
 		the there were some spectacular catches and a lot of home runs and they had uh several double plays you know and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		was it in Candlestick Park again
 	
 	
 		uh no it was uh uh Minnesota Twins versus the Atlanta Braves
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and both the teams were in last place at one point in the season
 	
 	
 		this year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my word
 	
 	
 		then they fought their way back up to the top and then of course Minnesota won i think in the seventh game and ended up
 	
 	
 		oh wow  oh that would be exciting i i was
 	
 	
 		so it was really exciting
 	
 	
 		listened a little bit about it but i didn't know you know much about it oh so it had to go the full seven games
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it looked for a while that like Atlanta was gonna the win you know before they went back to Minnesota  but it didn't happen you know they played
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
