 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you have any thoughts on uh uh uh our jury system
 	
 	
 		yeah actually i i have quite a few thoughts on it before i became a mother i was going to law school because i wanted to change how our law system right now is working
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because it's not
 		it's not working correctly
 	
 	
 		what parts of the of the system would you change
 	
 	
 		well i mean when they pick like when they pick a jury they're supposed to have an equal or almost equal number of men and women to get different viewpoints and they don't have that because the women can't appear in court because they have take care of their kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right
 		sure yeah and
 	
 	
 		so they they end up having an all male jury
 	
 	
 		right does the system not provide the system provides uh compensation for wages but they don't provide compensation for like say day care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they don't
 	
 	
 		no they don't
 	
 	
 		oh i'm that surprises me i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		and a lot of women have to cancel their appearance and tell the judge hey i can't i've got two or three kids at home that need me you know
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 	
 	
 		and all the judge can do is say oh okay you're excused
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's nothing the judge can do about it because there's no law that says you know the judge has to help them with day care so he you know they don't bother
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and most of the juries if if anybody did a study of most of the juries they'd see that it's almost always an all male jury because women can't leave their kids
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 	
 	
 		and if they do get a woman on the jury she is beyond the age of fifty
 	
 	
 		huh
 		that's curious i i i never even thought of that uh before um i i i did notice that uh most of the time the juries are males and  uh but i'd never thought of any reasons why or why not
 	
 	
 		well i wanted to go to law school mainly for the purpose that if i was doing something in the legal profession i thought maybe if enough people knew about the problem maybe we could do something about it but then of course i got married and became a mother so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's kind of taking a back burner right now but i'm i still intend to finish law school i've got two years left
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		where where did you begin
 	
 	
 		over in Arizona A S U
 	
 	
 		uh-huh a okay all right
 	
 	
 		but i
 		i just don't think it's very fair
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		because they say well it's all equal and you know we send papers to this many women yeah but how many do you actually pick because they can appear
 	
 	
 		right right yeah
 		um uh what are your thoughts on uh leaving the sentencing to the judge
 	
 	
 		i don't think that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		most judges that would be fine because they're pretty open minded
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but if someone accidentally got a judge that wasn't and there are judges out there that are racist or prejudiced about one thing or another
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		people could be convicted just because of personal feelings and i don't think that's right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think they need more views than just one
 	
 	
 		right
 		that that that that's curious uh i'm  i'm currently uh i have been asked to appear in court in Denver County Court uh uh for uh
 		a traffic violation which i kept uh uh i i tried to uh plead not guilty by mail and uh
 		for some reason i really uh hacked the judge off and so now i'm supposed to appear uh in court uh and and so i've been thinking a lot lately about uh
 		first of all what i'm gonna do i don't know if i'm going to uh just go ahead and pay the ticket now pay the plea bargain or or fight this thing to the end i i wasn't guilty and
 		uh but it's almost impossible uh you you know what what really aggravates me is it's impossible it's impossible i'm in graduate school and they set the court date on a Wednesday so to go from Dallas to Denver uh to fight a ticket
 		on a Wednesday would mean i'd have to leave either Monday or Tuesday and be back yeah and i go to school that misses a full week of graduate school well you just can't survive uh missing a full week of graduate school uh
 	
 	
 		and you'd miss school
 		oh yeah no kidding
 	
 	
 		uh  and uh it's it's completely absurd first of all that i that i got the ticket and it's completely absurd that i should appear on a Wednesday at court you know i could appear at Spring Break uh you know theoretically and and i wouldn't mind doing that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm trying to figure out what uh what action i'm going to take if any or if i'm just gonna go ahead and
 		forget it all and just pay it to to ease my uh ease my pain  but but you know it there there's a point uh  i guess you and i being younger uh tend to be a little more idealistic uh
 		uh but but i see uh
 		i i definitely see a an instance now where maybe i won't be as idealistic where where i would be able a uh willing to give up my ideals for uh
 		a little peace of mind and get them off my back which which is new to me i'd never been that way before
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well  a friend of mine got in really
