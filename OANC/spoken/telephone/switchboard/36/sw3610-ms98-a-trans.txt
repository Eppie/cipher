 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay the change how women's roles have changed
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh well i think we've moved out of the stereotype of the homemaker uh and i think it's been through necessity
 		with the economy and with the dysfunctional families
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes but i think it causes a lot of dysfunction in the family
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		women going out to work
 	
 	
 		uh possibly you know if if they're doing it simply um
 		for the money i think you know that
 	
 	
 		for the money
 	
 	
 		if if it's something that they need to fulfill themselves then that's something different too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that uh they should have the opportunity to do it and the quote homemaker's role should be divided equally between the partners
 	
 	
 		i do too when it's a necessity i know uh but it's funny how it's changed because when my mother
 		uh graduated well she took one year of normal school and then she taught school for three years before uh she met my father and they married and she had to quit teaching school because she was a married woman
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  that's right
 	
 	
 		so it it's changed a lot from then
 	
 	
 		and of course now women can be anything they want to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh one thing that has not changed is
 		is the equality of pay among the sexes
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i don't see any great hope for that being changed in the near future quite frankly
 	
 	
 		no no i don't either i just think that well men are just kind of in charge and they're not about to let women
 	
 	
 		but if you look at the people who make the decisions
 		uh the Senate and the House they're primarily male
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you know big decision makers are still male until we get that changed  you know i'm a single
 	
 	
 		parent
 	
 	
 		parent well a single person my children are are grown and married but uh i still have to support myself
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i you know i personally i don't work because i want to get out there and do it i work because if i want to eat i'm out there working
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i think that makes a big difference and i think it makes a big difference too if if after your children are raised uh you want to go out and fulfill yourself
 	
 	
 		well i did i didn't work while my children were young and i was married because i did want to give them the background that they got at home i did find afterwards though
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you take the children whose you know in a in a healthy family which i don't know how many of us have healthy families anymore  uh but i did find that the children of working parents
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or working parent uh were more independent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and maybe that goes to where it break it's breaking down the family bonds but i don't know of too many families that the women really work because they want to
 		uh most of them
 		are working and it's not to buy the TVs and the new cars it's to survive
 	
 	
 		yes i definitely think so and especially uh in those families that the husband does not have a college education
 	
 	
 		well even you know here our teachers are paid so poorly
 	
 	
 		they are in Utah too
 	
 	
 		and i don't know of any teacher whose wife is not having to work
 		so it's it's not just the men without a college education it's
 		our economy is really bad right now in Oklahoma it's real bad
 	
 	
 		oh is it  i don't think it's  quite as bad in Utah as it is throughout the nation
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well Oklahoma is certainly in the recession
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh we've been there we've been here for about three to five years now and it's really hurting
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh you know i don't i don't know that any woman would choose that a married woman would really choose to work because
 		when you're working and you're married you're holding down two jobs one at home and one at
 	
 	
 		right i i think that that's more though with a mother that's working
 	
 	
 		well yes
 	
 	
 		than than just a wife because i'm i'm not just a wife but a wife i i'm grateful that none of my daughters-in-laws at this time are working
 		because they all have small families and they're just i just think it's so sad when a  mother has to get a tiny baby up in the morning two months old and it's cold here and take him to a babysitter
