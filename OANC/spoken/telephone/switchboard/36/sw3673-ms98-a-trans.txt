 
     		
 	
 		you keep a budget
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um yes i do
 	
 	
 		okay how how do you work that
 	
 	
 		well usually it works out pretty well
 	
 	
 		does it
 	
 	
 		um i try to project out um right now i project out six months
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know i have my fixed monthly bills and i know how much they are
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i have a percentage of my savings that i attempt to
 		take off the top
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		not unless i have something come up that's unusual that i was unexpected and then i may have to go into savings
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		well that seems to work out pretty good
 	
 	
 		kind of the formula i use i use uh ninety percent of my check
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then i retain ten percent and if i don't use it then it goes into savings also
 	
 	
 		for savings
 		oh is it is it hard to set it up for the six month period rather than just a month or
 	
 	
 		well my monthly bills are pretty consistent you know you have your house payments the same every month uh car payments are the same you know when your insurance is due
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		so in fact
 	
 	
 		so you budget all that in that's why a lot of times i only use ninety percent of my salary because some months i'll have insurance
 	
 	
 		it might
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		two or three times a year
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i need that extra money and to take it out of savings at that point
 	
 	
 		oh so really when you're doing it it probably is just as easy to do it for the six month period rather than just a month at a time oh
 	
 	
 		sure
 		um-hum a month at a time is not a really a big picture of what's going on in your life because it doesn't give you any flexibility as far as uh unforeseen situations or something coming down the road that you know is coming down the road that you need to save for
 	
 	
 		no
 		uh-huh
 		oh right and then also i mean that's if you do it monthly that's twelve times you have to sit down and figure it out and you could save all that
 	
 	
 		yeah i do it uh twice a year and um you know i could adjust it every month that's no big deal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i just finished out December and uh when i was done with it i threw it away and i already had January through July made out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so you do it January to July and then July to December oh oh does now how did you say you worked your savings do you take your savings right off
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		i take the savings right off the top i pay myself first
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm the type of individual that uh you know i can't
 		i have to put something back for myself to feel like i'm doing my job
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right
 	
 	
 		it's my motivator
 	
 	
 		and how much at what percentage do you save
 	
 	
 		i save about fifteen percent
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		out of what out of my savings account not as well as the Japanese do
 	
 	
 		well that that's fairly good do you get paid once a month or by twice a month
 	
 	
 		twice a month uh uh actually every other week so twenty six checks
 	
 	
 		every two weeks
 		during the year oh that's great we
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		so twice a year i pick up an extra check also
 	
 	
 		oh that's right so that helps out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		gives you a bit there oh
 	
 	
 		how do you all do yours
 	
 	
 		well we
 		we don't really do very well we have never sat down and made out a formal budget we keep saying you know we're going to do this we're going to do this we we take our savings right out  right out first and put you know put it away and then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we just uh we're that's terrible but we just kind of spend what we need that's right that's right we take the savings out and uh you know put that in and then
 	
 	
 		spend what's left over huh
 	
 	
 		spend what what's left over like you said and i know we if we keep but we just don't know how to get down and get started i guess trying to decide how much goes where and you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		there's really no certain formula that you can say well i i wanna say this much and i'm gonna spend this much for the house and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i'm kind of in a situation right now that my our children are grown and they're gone so uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know and the house is almost paid for so we're in pretty good shape
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's great now how did you get started when you started doing have you always done a budget or what
 	
 	
 		uh we've done them for about fifteen years
 	
 	
 		about fifteen years oh so quite a while huh did you just sit down and decide
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this much is this much is gonna go here and
 		the thing we have a hard time with was you know like how much for the groceries and how much for the clothes and how much for
 	
 	
 		well
 		one thing we do about the groceries and when and we just got back from the grocery store and we've been doing this for a long time and we know exactly how much we spend at the grocery store because when we come home we write it down
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so in a given month
 		we know that we spent two hundred and fifty dollars or four hundred dollars or whatever it is and if it's four hundred dollars we look at it and say well why did we spend four hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and we spent four hundred dollars this month because or last month because uh we had several Christmas parties
 	
 	
 		December right right
 	
 	
 		so but we know approximately how much our our monthly grocery bill is you know and and you should be able to do that too within
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		ten or fifteen percent of what uh what you spend once you get a track record
 	
 	
 		right
 		if we just
 		huh so
 	
 	
 		and once you establish your track record
 	
 	
 		so what
