 
     		
 	
 		set
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		you you got the topic right okay um well where in Dallas are you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'm in Richardson
 	
 	
 		oh okay so you do recycling do recycling there okay
 	
 	
 		yeah Richardson has um well they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly if it's not raining
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they also have a couple of areas where you can take uh cans plastic and paper to uh you know dump them off there if you don't uh want to wait and have a pick up least of paper but they don't pick up the other items they don't pick up cans or the plastic
 	
 	
 		um-hum are they going to later or do you know
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure they only started to do the newspaper uh late last year just try like a trial basis and see how it goes so i don't know if they're going to pick up the other things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm well i'm i'm in Dallas proper in the city of Dallas and i know they do have you know a pilot program going on but it's not here
 	
 	
 		what about you
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		so they're not picking up anything  so i mean we we collect everything we've got all these boxes in our garage for you know green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything
 	
 	
 		oh
 		where do you take them
 	
 	
 		but um well there's there's a couple places unfortunately we can't find a place that'll take everything
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um there's a lot of places to take like the plastic um shopping bags like most of the grocery stores and there's a Wal-Mart nearby that takes almost everything i can't remember what it is they don't take
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and the library will take glass so we end up you know on the weekend we pack it all in the car and and as we go places we oh wait we can drop the glass off  you know drop things off one at a time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but um and it's kind of disappointing i mean i would even be happy if they just had one you know one place where you could do everything you know it would still be more convenient than what we have now
 	
 	
 		one of the people from my department i think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter
 	
 	
 		hm where is that
 	
 	
 		i think that was closer to downtown uh she's not here anymore but uh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i'm pretty far north i'm not
 		i'm i'm i'm just i'm north of Addison actually
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i'm i'm really  i'm sort i'm in Dallas but only technically
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well sometimes we take our uh we we always keep our aluminum cans  and a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		yeah i've seen those
 	
 	
 		you don't get too much money back i figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there but normally i collect oh like three trash bags full
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and i take them over to that can bank and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans  in the can bank you don't get too much money for them but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		well you get something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh we used to do that but again that's another stop and it doesn't take plastic bags and and all that sort of thing but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think that you know i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is and so hopefully they'll do it soon that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where i grew up we only had one a week and that was certainly sufficient so if they just do one of them will be trash and the alternate time would do recyclables that'd be great
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so i hope they do
 	
 	
 		ah i'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers you know i seem to put them out there on Wednesday and like sometimes they come by
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sometimes they don't i'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but i could certainly have uh three bins out there for you know plastic and and tin and paper whatever they were going to uh separate into and and have them pick it up on on one of the two days per week that would be easy
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah do you have to um sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that that sort of thing or do they take the whole thing
 	
 	
 		you're not supposed to have like the coupons in there
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		um or you're not supposed to put magazines in there and you can't take newspapers now at work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know we have changed our recycling at first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle
 		and not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears you can throw it in there because at first they said
 	
 	
 		let me guess you work at TI right
 	
 	
 		yeah at first they said they said no telephone books
 	
 	
 		so do i
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that well that's stupid and then they said no newspapers well in the my department everybody gets the Wall Street Journal
 	
 	
 		i know
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable so i thought that was pretty good to expand upon it and say anything paper
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well they and they take cans now too which is great
 	
 	
 		yeah i still put my cans in with the cans i think i don't want it with paper somehow it just seems weird to me
 	
 	
 		well our department used to collect the cans anyway for the Christmas tree project
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and in fact we got this past year we got all of our money for the Christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it worked out really well
 	
 	
 		well we had the the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter i think that's what that was called
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she collected she used to collect from the whole department but she took them all down to that Dallas Shelter place
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i wish i could remember that whole name of that place but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh yeah she used she used to collect them from everybody in the department she'd go up and down with her little bag  collecting from everybody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep yep because we would get it
