 
     		
 	
 		um what do you feel about child care
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well fortunately my children are
 		pretty much beyond that
 	
 	
 		mine are too but i think it's a real real a real serious situation for a lot of people
 	
 	
 		it certainly is
 	
 	
 		and i don't you know a lot about it where where you're working for this school department
 	
 	
 		yes um our YMCA has after school child care um at several of the schools so that they don't even have to you know go anywhere yeah
 	
 	
 		leave the school uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and then for other schools that they don't have it at the school they have it at the Y
 		and they pick them up in a a you know a van or whatever i think it kind of depends on how many
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well you're probably in a more uh oh what we we live in a rural rural area
 	
 	
 		students
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and so i think most of the people around here that have to leave their children leave them with uh neighbors or people you know in a home situation
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum well that's always nice too i did that when mine were were littler
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the uh first couple of years that i i worked only halftime when my first child was born and and he just stayed with a friend or somebody that maybe had one child you know his age
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um  and that always seemed to work out real well and you know when somebody would decide to quit or something i always
 		felt real panicky
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but always seemed to manage to find somebody that i thought was just as wonderful as the other one you know so it seemed to work out
 	
 	
 		yeah did you
 		have you worked all the time your children were little
 	
 	
 		um uh when i had my second one i stayed home for three and a half years
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then and then went back
 	
 	
 		so but that's about the time then they could go into a preschool situation
 	
 	
 		right right unfortunately the preschool that i wanted the second one to go to because my first one had
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		is a preschool that does not have any day care at all but it's such a wonderful preschool so i had to find somebody else to keep them and then and then somebody to take them there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that's always another problem
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh you know i don't know how people we it's pretty cold here in Utah in the winter and i think i just think it would be so hard to have to get a child up a baby
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and take it in the cold to someone early in the morning
 	
 	
 		right yep
 	
 	
 		i think that that i would let i think i would sooner have it in someone in the home taking care of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum but then that's awfully expensive too
 	
 	
 		in a home
 	
 	
 		yeah well i mean if so you have someone come into your home
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh-huh to come into your home but i
 	
 	
 		you know that
 		that would be real nice but just almost almost cost prohibitive prohibitive you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes unless you can get could get a a nanny or something that i know a lot of the girls here go off as nannies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and stay in people's homes and take care of them after they've graduated from high school not a lot but some of them
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i think that'd be an ideal situation i've never had to to uh work out of the home i've had we had uh six children and they just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i would just  i was just here with them
 	
 	
 		well you just worked period huh  if you had six children
 	
 	
 		right  and right  well there was seventeen years between them but that uh yeah well i just i just really that's what i wanted to do you know and but i know that my
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		children's spouses and i have five boys and a girl and uh
 	
 	
 		oh  where did the girl come
 	
 	
 		in the middle uh-huh we kept trying  but uh the our our daughter or none of them have worked very much while their children have been little
 	
 	
 		middle
 		oh that's good
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so but uh we have fourteen grandchildren so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		this is i i feel lucky that they have not had to go out of the home
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		because i i  i don't know i just think that those first two or three years and then again in high school they they need their mother there
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true yeah that is true well how cold is it up there
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh it's in the  how cold is it honey right now
 		about twenty eight
 	
 	
 		oh okay well it's about fifty here so  uh no it's quit yeah it was bad there for a little bit but uh anyway
 	
 	
 		is it still raining
 		oh good are you
 		um-hum
 		what do you do in the school district do you
 	
 	
 		i'm a librarian
 	
 	
 		oh well that's be interesting i love books
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i liked that a lot and i kind of wanted to continue it even though my children were you know when they were born but like i said i was able to stay home for
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		those three years so it made a difference
 	
 	
 		well i think if you're trained and i think if you feel it within yourself that you want to be out  you know and you you have uh
 		you have the ability and stuff that's great there were times when i would have loved to have got you know uh-huh to left to have left my kids and you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		to get out yeah that's true i think
 		and everybody feels that way at times at least
 	
 	
 		i'm sure they do
 	
 	
 		and then also that you'd love to be home  at
 	
 	
 		i'm sure that's so too
 	
 	
 		at other times but uh one thing i think it does do is it it it forces  it forces you to make your children be organized and
 	
 	
 		and i think it makes them more independent um-hum
 	
 	
 		and independent that's right that
