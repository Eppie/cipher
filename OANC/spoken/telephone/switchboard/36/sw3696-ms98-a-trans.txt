 		hi i'm Carol and i'm calling from Garland Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah uh this is Jan Noak i'm in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh okay because yesterday i talked to someone upstate i'm not even sure where and my husband talked to people in Utah so
 		um anyway let me press one
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay um let me see
 		i think we've only planned one family reunion in our life so we don't do this too often
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		um most of my family's in California but my husband's is in San Antonio and so we did this in San Antonio and um it was an experience that i i won't do again
 	
 	
 		how big a family do you have
 	
 	
 		um well it wasn't that big of a family but um
 		it just got out of hand and um so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and
 		and um how much um beverages we were going to need and this and that and oh it just grew and grew and grew and um
 		when the time came only about half that amount of people came so it wasn't you know you have to really just get an accurate amount and but overall we all had a good time we saw people we hadn't see in a while so
 	
 	
 		did you have people coming from far away
 	
 	
 		no it was all in the San Antonio area
 	
 	
 		uh sometimes it's
 	
 	
 		but it it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing and we're going oh my gosh so
 	
 	
 		well you have you have family lives too close together they see each other too often they uh they don't take that kind of thing seriously
 	
 	
 		uh-huh basically
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and if uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they they come from far away it's uh
 		it it they take it more seriously
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i think you're right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah my family's not very big but uh we're kind of
 	
 	
 		your family's from where
 	
 	
 		well i have a a a brother lives in Indianapolis a sister lives in Chicago and my folks live back in Buffalo New York
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i i guess we have reunions about once a year or so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we got together over Christmas my wife's family they're they're all in upstate most of them are in upstate New York they have regular uh regular family reunions every summer
 	
 	
 		oh those are nice
 	
 	
 		and it's yeah it is it's uh
 	
 	
 		and i'm i'm sure they're a lot more organized too because they've done it before
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's it's just something that they they plan on doing every summer they just have a weekend picnic and uh every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening and they just plan on being there
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		oh
 		yeah that makes a big difference too
 		when everybody's real eager to participate
 		yeah well that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah they
 		they had a family reunion for uh well for my mother-in-law at her seventy fifth birthday and they managed to get just about everybody
 		everybody into town uh last November including a a number of people from out in California
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so is uh
 		it it was good it uh it worked out very well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		one interesting interesting thing that they did at the time is they um
 		they videotaped the the whole shebang which
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it made a nice remembrance of of the entire party
 	
 	
 		yeah more people want to come back again
 	
 	
 		yeah they want to come back
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good
 	
 	
 		so so that that works pretty well that way
 	
 	
 		my uh
 		my grandmother in California is um  which is my dad's part side of the family is planning a reunion um this spring but we won't be going because um
 		i don't know how they thought of this it's going to be on a cruise
 		and um it seems like most of the family is uh going you know all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are going most of them are going but
 		it's too costly for us but anyway they're going to go on a cruise and um it sounds really neat it really does
 	
 	
 		yeah i i can go for that that what what the i i guess interesting if you had uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh a very extended family that that kind of involved a lot of people that that cousins and things that you don't really know that you've never met it'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i don't know how you would go about uh
 		getting them together but
 		that uh would be uh
 	
 	
 		and a friend of mine um she plans her family reunion
 		um every year and they go camping and she says they have the greatest time and she says usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person but she said they all go camping and they have a really good time for the whole weekend
 		so that's
 	
 	
 		yeah i kind of wonder what what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family you know i had hoped that our our kids get together uh at least regularly
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		right now we only have two children so i
