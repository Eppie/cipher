 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		say you did uh starters and Bendix springs such as that on an old one
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh  helped my wife replace some carburetors
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some that she had to uh
 		um label everything
 	
 	
 		she had to label everything what was she driving
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah because it was a Cadillac
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they uh well  they quit making those the Quadrajet carburetor and they quit making it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they rebuilt it and it never did never did run right again
 	
 	
 		yeah Quadrajet not real easy to get rebuilt just right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		what were you replacing the starters and Bendix drives on
 	
 	
 		um  a Maverick and also um a Chrysler station wagon before that
 	
 	
 		yeah did you replace just the uh the Bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter
 	
 	
 		uh the i'm replacing the two or three starters on the Chrysler
 	
 	
 		yeah the starters are kind of fragile
 	
 	
 		they
 		yeah and the
 	
 	
 		especially if you need a tune up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		they kept saying that the Chrysler that's what Chryslers did is they wore out starters you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well if if if they start real easy you know you just hit the key and it starts up and when it's properly tuned up that starter will last for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see they built that starter so it'd fit every V-8 and all the slant sixes
 		that they built in like thirty five years
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they all take the exact same starter they'll interchange completely i mean completely one starter will fit all of them
 		so they've got a whole lot of torque but to do that they did uh they use an underdrive system where they geared it down
 		so its motor spins really fast
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it's got to spin for very long it's kind of tough on the bushings usually what goes is the bushings you take a little time replace the bushings you still got a perfectly good starter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh most places don't put don't rebuild them with with good with good enough bushings so it's you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		after you get rebuilt one you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly especially if you need a tune-up
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		anyway what are you driving now
 	
 	
 		um my Chrysler van
 		and it's it's pretty maintenance free you know and uh and beginning the year last year
 		and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon and it didn't give me any trouble at all
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what is it a late model set Chrysler van
 	
 	
 		it's a eighty seven
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		one of the little minivans
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		is it
 	
 	
 		do you like the way it rides and such
 	
 	
 		uh rides or runs
 	
 	
 		rides rough
 	
 	
 		it yeah well yeah it rides rides rough it runs good you know i kind of it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you have to kind of wait for it especially when you get on the highway
 	
 	
 		yeah right now without getting some of the sportier models uh the four cylinders aren't real peppy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years too
 	
 	
 		you driven American cars all
 	
 	
 		uh see i've driven one import uh i drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while about a month um in that month i think i put uh three oil coolers on it um
 		every time i turned around i was having trouble with it everything else i ever owned was American built
 		uh mostly older cars um i've been a mechanic well i worked starting working my father's service station when i was about uh
 		twelve
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i've been around cars a lot
 		but uh driven a lot of old Pontiacs
 		my first three cars were uh seventy model Pontiacs a GTO and a Bonneville and a station wagon and
 		i had a couple of Chryslers had a Super B for a while with a four forty in it
 		it a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		not not much gas mileage though
 	
 	
 		i don't know gas mileage wasn't too bad i got about seventeen
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		well till you got crazy with it you know you get the four barrel all worked up and suddenly it it it drops off fast but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		long as you didn't spin the tires too much or or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it it didn't do too bad on gas
 		didn't have to work very hard to move the car around
 	
 	
 		now do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know the my last GM car was a seventy Chevy station wagon
 		uh it still had the points and condenser in it
 		when i rebuilt the engine on that about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i uh pulled that old points distributor out and got a an HEI distributor electronic distributor and put into it
