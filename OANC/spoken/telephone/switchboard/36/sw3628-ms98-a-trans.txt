 
     		
 	
 		what vacations have you been on that you like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		well i really enjoyed um i went to Mackinaw Island
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		a few years back it's in the middle of Lake Michigan
 		and so that was nice i like um driving to a different cities because of the scenery
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that was nice
 	
 	
 		so you mostly yours is kind of driving and
 	
 	
 		yeah we've i've been all over the states except for pretty much east
 		um it's very pretty driving like um up north in Wisconsin too
 	
 	
 		um
 		how how far uh do you usually end end up driving just
 	
 	
 		um the furthest i drove was probably
 		Texas and then i've taken a train before to California
 	
 	
 		now where you're from where
 	
 	
 		Kenosha Wisconsin
 	
 	
 		oh Wisconsin okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so yeah that's quite a ways
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		i've uh
 		we went to California this last year and uh liked it but it was too crowded Walt Disney World and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		all those places it's just the wrong time of the year to go
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh course uh you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's uh outrageously priced and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		kind of  you wonder if they're it's really worth it to pay uh thirty five dollars or forty dollars just to get in
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		but
 		there's lots of fun places to see um i think the scenery kind of that's something do to you like to get up in mountains or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		do you have any mountains nearby
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		it's pretty flat isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think uh
 		the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money isn't it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what vacation have you enjoyed the most
 	
 	
 		um
 		probably uh when we go to Wisconsin Dells
 		um it's pretty fun there's a lot to do up there it's pretty busy though you have to like crowds you know i
 	
 	
 		what is it
 	
 	
 		um oh it's uh
 		like a huge amusement park  um they have water slides
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's just a big big tourist attraction there's the downtown is all like little shops and candy shops and
 		it's it's really neat i don't think uh hardly anybody lives there because it's just kind of like you know tourists
 	
 	
 		probably a city in itself kind of like huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's mostly a a summer summer place
 	
 	
 		summer place how far away is it
 	
 	
 		um from Kenosha it's about three hours
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's about a hour away from Madison
 	
 	
 		okay sure
 	
 	
 		yeah so that's nice it's it's pretty ride up there too i  really like the city Wausau in Wisconsin it's really pretty
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		it's nice out there i i like all the nature things there are to look at you know
 	
 	
 		right well and you could probably you're in a climate that's kind of humid so you have probably a lot of green and
 		a lot of real pretty things our our climate's real dry and
 	
 	
 		where is that
 	
 	
 		you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery most of the most most the land's pretty brown you don't have as much of the greenery like you have
 	
 	
 		oh where is that
 	
 	
 		uh Idaho is where i live and uh yes
 	
 	
 		i don't twenty five oh okay
 	
 	
 		it's by uh i have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that i'm on the phone it's by um Boise you ever heard of Boise and uh  it's fun it's nice it's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's  lot different kind of i lived in Indiana for a while and it's a real different uh
 		land and scenery than there it's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		things like that i think uh
 		there's a lot of places uh oh down even in southern Utah the canyons canyon lands and Bryce Canyon and
 		oh boy they're gorgeous  Lake Tahoe
 	
 	
 		oh  do that yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		those are kind of fun places we usually go over to Bear Lake in the summer which is uh
 		kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah and  the lake goes on forever and that's real pretty over there too
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i think i'm kind of a summer vacationer
 	
 	
 		yeah i do
 		oh yeah me too uh me too unless i'm going somewhere warm  for the winter  yeah that'd be nice
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
