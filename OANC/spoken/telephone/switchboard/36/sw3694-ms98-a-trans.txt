 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay  i'm sorry speaking of air pollution i'm  coughing like a dog now um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly
 		i find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use
 		cause the air pollution and it just doesn't seem like
 	
 	
 		yeah it it
 	
 	
 		but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know and it it's kind of dangerous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true uh i don't know we live um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i'm close to Salt Lake and there's mountains um you know all around but sometimes i i think tend to hold a little bit of it in you know really it's it's fairly clean
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think it's a fairly clean city compared to some but you have quite as
 	
 	
 		but you think the mountains and the are kind of a barrier hum that's a
 	
 	
 		yeah i think sometimes it seems to be but
 	
 	
 		that's an interesting thought
 	
 	
 		but uh anyway i don't know i know there's a lot of plants here when i drive down you know along the just along the freeway there's a lot of plants that they're burning things and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um
 		here in Texas i know a lot of the
 		pretty much every place here is is relatively flat and so i would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a like a smog problem or something like that i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah we we have a real fog problem um the last few years just in through December and January it it really it is foggy and seems to just um
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's kind of like it it just stays for a month  it's quite foggy but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		jeez i don't i don't know what else i know cars
 	
 	
 		i i guess yeah i guess i've never really uh thought about the fact that like in California they they have a lot of smog problems
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's real hilly there so that is probably something that plays a big factor  i think probably just uh a lot of factories
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um you know they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them i don't know what you call them and different things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's that's what i see burning a lot and i'm not exactly sure what they're burning i know uh-huh there's some oil companies and and i'm sure that that contributes a lot just the burning of the chemicals
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of uh special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know i haven't i haven't heard that i know uh i don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything but i know i think they they differ from state to state
 	
 	
 		hum
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but um you know that's been a new thing in the last few years and i guess some cars are a lot worse than others i think those uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what are they the i know a a Rabbit's one diesel the diesel cars yeah they they seem to put out quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the diesel oh yeah
 		
 
 		i don't know a lot of people with diesels  unless it's a truck you know
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		oh well do you um are you working for T I
 	
 	
 		no i don't i work i work in Waco at a TV station so my mother works at TI so that's how i
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		oh uh-huh and that's how you got involved yeah no we we have um uh my husband's sister lives in Dallas actually and they kind of got it us involved that way
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah do you work at T I oh okay
 		okay
 		oh okay that's interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah but well i don't i don't know much
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what else causes air pollution um noise
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah noise
 	
 	
 		noise causes air pollution and noise pollution
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got speaking of noise you can probably hear my little
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah  that's why i thought of it i thought
 	
 	
 		yes he's he is quite noisy yes jeez i don't know i know that um
 	
 	
 		hum how funny
 	
 	
 		don't dumps  you know where you dump all your trash in the they uh yeah and i'm sure that does i know they're always churning that up and i i think they burn a lot there too i
 	
 	
 		oh yeah landfills yeah
 		we just
 		yeah we just had a big uh thing here in Waco they're needing to open a new landfill or to expand onto the old landfill
 		and uh it it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded because they're thinking that their water is going to be contaminated somehow and so they
 	
 	
 		oh well  yeah i don't think i'd i'd like that you know we um when we've taken things to the dump just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the dump that is uh you know closest to us there's some houses around there and i know that on windy days you know they're always moving the the trash over to different spots and they've got those big bulldozers and you can see the dust
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		flying and and i'm sure that their homes are really quite dusty and
 	
 	
 		and one one of the big concerns is they have a there's a school right across the highway from the landfill yeah so the parents were really really upset
 	
 	
 		oh is there
 		worried about the their kids getting huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah and they've they've been fighting over it for the last year and they just now approved it so they were gonna try an appeal or something
