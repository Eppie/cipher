 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		now are we off and running
 	
 	
 		that you were saying sorry
 	
 	
 		oh i was just saying i guess old age has a few compensations i don't have to plan as carefully as i used to but uh
 	
 	
 		do you feel like you you took the steps that you you were glad that you took um earlier i mean would you have done anything differently
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so uh we have three children and we were able to put all three of them through college and um
 	
 	
 		that's that's quite a feat in today's
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		economic situation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful um i'm sort of beginning in that score um we have a two year old daughter and hope to have another child soon so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's it's not easy putting enough aside but we're doing a um our best to try and have fairly regular meetings to discuss at least where our goals are sometimes um
 		it is less consistent than than it could be in terms of our ability to put money aside but um
 		i'm i'm curious about the things that you did that that seemed to work best for you that you'd pass on to somebody else
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh well
 	
 	
 		as as advice
 	
 	
 		the only way if if you spend all you take in every month
 		you're uh living beyond your means
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and emergencies or what we could would consider an emergency uh always come up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i i don't care how how you how closely you think you figured and then planned something always comes up
 		so uh when i i guess we started by necessity because we went to uh law school on my husband's GI Bill
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		back in the days when uh the government paid
 		uh the student's tuition and and bought books up to a certain amount plus uh gave the veteran a stipend we started off with ninety dollars a month and then a little bit later got up to a hundred and five dollars a month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so there was no way that we could do except when we cashed our monthly stipend was to put twenty dollars a week in an envelope
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		deciding that it was better to go without one day a week than for four days at the end of the month
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then uh later on
 		when we got out of school my husband got recalled into the Air Force when the Korean mess came up
 		and uh
 		so we had already established the envelope habit and uh
 	
 	
 		and the envelope is your savings
 	
 	
 		no no no this was our weekly budget
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but uh we realized very early on that if we were going to have money to buy cars and that sort of thing that we would have to save up beforehand
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		we uh
 		uh began uh in nineteen fifty uh to pay cash for everything we bought a car in nineteen fifty and paid it off in three months
 		so since then except for a house
 		houses we've paid cash for everything and uh to illustrate how well that works so that you have the opportunity to take care of special pricing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh our headquarters was transferred from South Carolina to Texas one time
 		and because Texas gas was much much cheaper to cook with than electricity
 		this one couple that we were transferred with uh bought a gas stove
 		a very simplified gas stove for a hundred and forty some odd dollars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we had uh in storage and used uh just a little teeny gas stove but after we got to Waco
 		we saw an ad in the paper one day where a lady who had uh was moving into a house with a built in oven had
 		the very best stove that Sears made at the time with two ovens a grill in the middle on top clock all the fancy amenities
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we were able to buy it for a hundred dollars
 		because we had the cash
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh uh
 	
 	
 		that's that's been the case for us with with uh cars and our preference recently has been used cars so it's been nice to be able to negotiate when you have cash when you're buying a car
 	
 	
 		the
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's a that's a an important lesson do you feel like you've passed that along to your three kids given how different the economy's been in their lives
 	
 	
 		no unfortunately we have not except for one daughter-in-law and uh  rise up and call her blessed every day
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh for some reason or other my husband didn't see fit to give the boys a meaningful allowance he just felt he had to keep control control of the purse strings
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh when they went off to college they had never really budgeted
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh that that was a big mistake so even though you know your children are going to make mistakes
 		uh i don't i don't know how to tell you
