 		oh did he like it
 	
 	
 		yeah he did
 	
 	
 		we yes we did it was it was a good story and and they sign you know at the end they signed their name so i guess that

 		huh
 		okay i saw that recently
 	
 	
 		a couple weeks ago have you seen that one did you like it oh at the movie house or
 	
 	
 		yeah in fact i saw it twice
 		well actually once it was on an airplane and then the second time it was at a um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's interesting it's an old uh theater not a movie theater but like a play theater
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		that and they've put in tables and chairs  then they show movies in there
 	
 	
 		well how fun
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of neat yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that was that was kind of a fun one  we'd heard a lot about that and had waited until it came you know out on video and then rented it and enjoyed it um have you seen Doc Hollywood
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yes
 	
 	
 		did you enjoy that one
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah we haven't seen that either we're waiting a couple more weeks and then we'll watch it is that fairly funny or
 	
 	
 		um yeah it's it's one of these lighthearted things it's it's not very serious but it's it it was cute i really i enjoyed it so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh oh good how about Beauty and the Beast have you
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		we haven't seen we promised our kids we'd take them over Christmas vacation so probably in the next couple of weeks we'll see that one but
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		
  
 		i haven't seen that i saw Hundred and One Dalmatians
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh did you oh that's fun i liked the do you have kids or did you go just for yourself just for yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no  i went with my next door neighbor  our husbands both said no way
 	
 	
 		well how fun
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it used to be my favorite movie when i was little so i went back and
 	
 	
 		oh now i wonder that's not not out on video is it
 	
 	
 		i don't think so
 	
 	
 		i wonder if that'll be the next one they release maybe if that's
 	
 	
 		i don't know but you know we went for a dollar it was fun
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i really enjoyed it i didn't get bored or anything either
 	
 	
 		oh now now did you like do you like the little theater where you go and and watch the movies
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a real nice one it's brand new
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um i i suspect it'll be a full priced theater when this highway goes in but right now it's almost in the middle of nowhere
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so it's not very crowded and it's real inexpensive and it's brand new so it's it's a really nice place to go
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh
 		well that's fun yeah we we our little community doesn't have a movie theater but we the nearest town has a um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they have it's a four you know four theaters in one that has the different shows going on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i know they've gotten Addams Family have you seen that one have you Addams Family do you think are you going are you interested at all in that
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 		i don't know i think my husband'll want to see it so i'll do the same thing i'll wait till it's less expensive
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		because he said when he went to see Star Trek he was out in California with a friend he said it was like seven fifty a person
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		wow my word and what how much is it for a movie there where you're at
 	
 	
 		i think it's about six dollars yeah
 	
 	
 		is it we were when we went it was four fifty four fifty a person and that seems like a real lot to me even
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah well i think you can get that maybe on a matinee here but
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know about six dollars is what they're running and that's why i don't normally go to them
 	
 	
 		
  
 		boy
 		boy i'll say not that's a that's a chunk we usually get go ahead and get the discount tickets but i don't think they were accepting them on on Star Trek or you know some of the newer ones i guess they don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		to try and make their money and so so do you watch do you enjoy movies or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we usually go usually every weekend we go to one yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		do you oh that's fun so you've seen you have a wide variety under your belt then right
 	
 	
 		yeah well we never used to do that until this other theater went in and it's you know it's inexpensive and it's entertainment for night
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and um the only thing is that when people at work talk about the current movies i don't know what's going on but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know about four weeks later i will
 	
 	
 		oh do they come that soon
 	
 	
 		yeah they have been lately it used to be you'd have to wait months and months and now like i was just looking at the listings now this week they started showing All I Want for Christmas
 	
 	
 		oh wow yeah
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and that's a very recent release
 	
 	
 		boy i'll say i can't imagine why everybody doesn't wait till they come there because like you well like you say around here we have to wait
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i don't know
 	
 	
 		oh a couple um probably six months to a year before they go to the dollar dollar theaters
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah
 		it used to be like that but now
