 
     		
 	
 		what magazines are you reading these days
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i get a uh
 		quite a few uh
 		we've said that our
 		our magazine subscriptions uh really add up to a strange bunch but i get i get Business Week uh i get one called uh Dulcimer Player's News i get uh
 		uh the Washington Post uh Weekly magazine
 		uh we get Time uh and then i get uh uh well i guess i don't get any electronics magazines anymore i get uh electronics uh
 		news newspaper
 		uh what about you
 	
 	
 		well i get the three um weeklies Newsweek and
 		Time and US News i also get Sports Illustrated guess those are the only ones i get weekly and then once a month we get a whole slew of them we get Money Magazine and um Southern Living and Country Living and
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and um my wife has a whole ton of them she subscribes to
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  yeah
 	
 	
 		a whole whole bunch of those
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		well i guess i guess the good thing about these um weekly magazines especially how they put things in them you know they have time to at least put things in perspective
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh you know i guess the bad thing is they don't have the immediacy of you know radio or TV or a or a newspaper but they certainly can you know give you a bigger picture on things than than the than the daily media can
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that little bit of the of the whys behind what's happening and not just the the facts yeah i uh
 	
 	
 		they can be responsive too i know this summer US News was going to take a week off in August and then when the attempted coup came along they quickly came out with an issue an issue that they weren't going to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which shows that they're that they're certainly are responsive to changing events
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well i know that yeah and the category that i forgot is the the uh
 		professional uh ones i'm i'm a member of uh I triple E and uh
 		uh ACM Association for Community Materials i get uh three or four uh the magazine magazine form things uh that way uh too so uh
 		i i don't know what the what the status is in general of of people reading magazines i i certainly uh do a lot of it and and uh newspapers for that matter but i uh
 		i've heard that the trend in reading in general and and in especially newspapers is down that people just
 	
 	
 		well i think you're right i think trend in reading i think one reason that the Times Herald folded and other papers folded is the people are reading newspapers less than they used to and i guess that means they must be reading magazines and you know other written stuff less too
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i think so i i don't i haven't heard exactly how it's effecting the magazines maybe not quite as much but uh i think that the
 		more and more people are just depending on the TV for what what news they do get and
 	
 	
 		of course then you have the specialty magazines like magazines on baseball or Golf Digest or or knitting or crocheting and all these things
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that have a selective market  that just aim at one kind of thing those maybe it's that the that the special purpose magazines are doing better and the ones that are more general aren't doing as well
 	
 	
 		that could be that could be because there's not there's not really an alternative uh  uh source for that kind of kind of information but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i guess if you want to find out a specific item you have nowhere else to turn if you want to find out the the latest in gardening trends unless you read a gardening magazine you're not going to find this anyplace else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		whereas if you want to know what happened in in in Russia today you can turn on the radio or TV and you don't really have to read a paper or magazine to find out something
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that may be it and with desktop publishing and stuff i think a lot more magazines that are that aim just smaller market will be coming out
 	
 	
 		yeah i i wonder if that i wonder if that will uh uh make things different i've heard that uh
 		read an article just last week about fax newspapers coming out and wonder if they'll do that with uh you know magazine kinds of things as well i uh was it uh
 		uh Skip uh Bayless
 	
 	
 		yeah i heard uh i heard it too Skip Bayless wasn't it yeah
 	
 	
 		from the Times Herald is doing a a fax sports column
 	
 	
 		yeah i read three times a week he's going to fax you the sports column i don't know i don't know how that will catch on
 	
 	
 		uh
 		no but uh uh it was interesting uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought that i that would be interesting to to see though
 	
 	
 		um kind of
 		and it they for a long time they've been talking about that you know that that
 		moving away from paper magazines uh i guess would it be included in that in terms of of uh computer access and stuff but that that
 		doesn't really seem to have caught on to the extent that they keep predicting uh
 	
 	
 		well you know you you you don't have time
