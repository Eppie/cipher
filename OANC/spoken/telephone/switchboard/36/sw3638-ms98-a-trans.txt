 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh well uh the Cowboys are my favorite team that's pretty easy to say nowadays lot easier than it was a couple years ago
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they had a big win today uh did you get to watch it
 	
 	
 		no i didn't i uh have been at my computer all day so
 	
 	
 		oh are you a Cowboy fan
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i used to be a real big Cowboy's fan and and uh
 		i'm not at Jimmy Johnson's fan
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		being an Okie
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		i just really don't care much uh it's it's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan though
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they've always been you know my favorite
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh and and i guess i still have a soft spot i just hate that that's the coach  that's leading them so now have they they're in the play-offs right
 	
 	
 		yet
 		
 
 		right
 		right
 		yeah they made it to the play-offs finally like just you know two years ago they were one and fifteen they won like just one game
 		and so it's a pretty fast turn around but this year they made it to play-offs and today was their first game and they beat the Chicago Bears
 		so everybody's really going crazy you know down here
 	
 	
 		i'll bet they are
 	
 	
 		they're going crazy so
 		so they turned it around but yeah they have a lot of young exciting players now up
 		i mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired Tom Landry but you know now it's like you know they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that
 	
 	
 		uh at football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		hit a bad season and it's you know the coach's fault let's let's dump him
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		first good season the coach can do no wrong
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but they've Dallas has always been good ahead you know heading good players and and both running
 	
 	
 		exactly you know
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		running backs and and defense
 	
 	
 		right  yeah uh
 		you know they have a young team it's you know a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old you know players every year and
 		you know same coach same everything so now it's you know like a taste of something different they're all not you know mister nice guys like they used to be now it's like you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		tough and dirty team so everybody is really excited and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		who's their competition gonna be
 	
 	
 		well it's supposed to be the Redskins but you know we beat them already we beat them this year in in Washington so
 		you know so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl but you know
 		it's just that we have to play every game away you know it's gonna be tough but
 		but every their competition is are teams that they've already beat this year so i mean Atlanta they're in it too and we beat them
 		and uh see Detroit we play them next week but you know we should beat them everybody feels like we should be able to beat them so
 		it's  so everything is uh looking real good
 	
 	
 		course i think you know you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because teams jell together or they've had injuries that heal and you know it can be a totally or injuries that uh have newly happened
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one you played
 	
 	
 		yeah well the Cowboys are on a roll they've won like i think six or seven in a row now so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the in the league going into the play-offs
 		so
 	
 	
 		well well since you have a OU uh drop out  as a quarterback
 	
 	
 		uh right yeah Troy Aikman he got hurt at OU so he transferred to UCLA
 	
 	
 		well he
 		he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at OU
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		OU's always been known for their running game more than
 	
 	
 		um-hum they're playing tonight in fact i'm watching them on TV right now
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but they're doing some stomping on Virginia
 	
 	
 		oh i tell you they've they've not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts
 	
 	
 		really well they're doing good tonight
 	
 	
 		are they i haven't been watching
 	
 	
 		yeah they're winning they're winning forty one to seven
 	
 	
 		well good for us  oh
 	
 	
 		yeah right but
 		yeah and uh that's right Aikman did go to OU i forgot about that
 	
 	
 		yep they had then he went out to
 		let's see Southern Cal is that where you went
 	
 	
 		yeah uh UCLA yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so
 	
 	
 		but
 		the Cowboys did good today i mean i was proud i thought i thought they would get beat today because
 		i mean they're so young you know play-offs
