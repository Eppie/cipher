 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh crime is our subject
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		have you ever been accused of a crime
 	
 	
 		have i um no i guess not
 	
 	
 		i haven't either really i guess other than you want to count car accidents or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they asked for solutions uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's it
 	
 	
 		i'll i'll be i'll be very out forespoken here uh the Arabs don't do everything in the world right but gosh they sure don't have too many repeat offenders over there
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true they uh in in fact uh also i don't know if you're familiar with the Japanese method of of dealing with crimes
 	
 	
 		uh no i no i'm not
 	
 	
 		but they don't they have an extremely low rate extremely low especially considering the uh the density of the population and stuff um they have uh they have this this sense of of family that's very important to them and and family honor
 		and what they do the the main punishment the most effective portion of their punishment is that they take and publish
 		the offender's name in a newspaper that gets spread all over the country and especially in the region that they're in
 	
 	
 		and the family's name too
 	
 	
 		it well it gives the the person's name and the family is typically so embarrassed
 		that they have to they sell their house they leave they leave the region and move to to the opposite end of Japan of Japan and so it shames the entire family including the grandparents and and maybe aunts and uncles
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's similar to what was this town maybe it was here in some place that on prostitution
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when they caught a uh a a a customer trying to solicit a prostitute either way however you wanna say it they would publish the names of the customer and address of the customer in the newspaper
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there are a lot of divorces lot of family counseling going on but prostitution went down in that city
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i i'm willing to bet yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it just about killed the business  well publicity huh it doesn't work over in this country does it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well well you know the thing i guess the thing is is you know with the uh the in part uh one of the things to blame is the disintegration of the family in general and and the importance of the family and and and that's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know you can't just magically push a button and make that come back i guess but uh
 	
 	
 		uh if you yeah if you can wanna compare crime rates by divorce and and single parents and everything else i'm sure they'll be at a direct proportion to it
 	
 	
 		probably uh related
 	
 	
 		uh unfortunately uh
 	
 	
 		but incidentally incidentally um i just uh just just reading in the newspaper about um uh this they're i don't know they were moving some of the uh highway uh things in here in Texas recenttly the offices
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and they had ranked Dallas as being uh
 		seven out of seven on scale of of quality of life and i assume that that that includes that includes crime nowhere nowheres else nowhere else in the state was above about a three point two yeah and and and and Dallas was a seven point O
 	
 	
 		seven for Dallas
 		if if you live but we cut them off at five hundred a a year and January first we had three in one day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i swear uh
 	
 	
 		i i really yeah i really i thought it was pretty surprising
 	
 	
 		i think Austin should be seven of seven that is i went to school and graduated from UT and oh it's hey if i  if i hadn't stayed in Austin i should've gone to Stephenville Texas i'll tell you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well they they uh even even Austin's had it's share of of nasty crimes recently right with the with the sort of senseless murder of these girls at the um
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		at uh the ice cream parlor guy just walked in and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		pull the trigger
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so
 	
 	
 		well obviously in Texas we let them out too soon
 	
 	
 		but you know look at the what's the cost of keeping them in it's something like uh uh yeah it's like twenty thousand dollars per per year to keep somebody in jail
 	
 	
 		astronomical
 		did you see where the private ventures that built the jails and they're gonna help alleviate the overcrowding conditions are don't have any customers
 	
 	
 		hum
 		nobody wants  the city or the the government doesn't wanna let them do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		who
 		i i guess
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it looks to me like you know whether you you you get government out of it and give it to private enterprise it's done cheaper and more economical and more efficiently put the profit motive in front of anybody and all of a sudden it it works
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		all of a sudden it works huh
 	
 	
 		isn't that awful no it's not that's what makes just customer go around you know i was telling a guy from IRS and and i said something about profit he said thank goodness for profit i said i beg your pardon he said yeah  Internal Revenue Service we tax profits  i wouldn't have a job if there wasn't any profits
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 		
 
 		yeah yeah that's true
 		you rather have people to cry to yeah but i don't know you know i mean obviously you know obviously some more jails isn't really the solution either i don't know i mean that doesn't seem to be
 	
 	
 		um well
 		maybe we ought to um
 	
 	
 		terribly effective
 	
 	
 		put them in these Air Force bases that are closing and utilize those you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well there's there've been several you know those those kind of died on the vine they were there were separate proposals around to do that kind of thing and i haven't heard anything about them recently and maybe maybe i'm the one that just hasn't been paying attention
 	
 	
 		um
 		i read an interesting article in Texas Monthly a few months back about this guy that was a uh a guard at the Ellis Unit down in Huntsville
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he was a regular guard a a what they call a new boot or something like that and one thing led to another somebody asked for light of a cigarette or a cigarette and before long he was running dope for them and he got caught and now he's in prison himself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the the article purpose of the article was just to emphasize that nobody's above it um
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah i know
