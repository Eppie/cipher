 
     		
 	
 		oh do you have very many family reunions that one you have over to Bear Lake is the grandfather of all of them isn't it
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh yeah now that one's a fun one that that is fun i know that sometimes i've the one that's been hard for me is the one that the Skidmores used to do at Christmas time
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i i think its just because it was  i seem to always be bad weather and i'm just going over the
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know the yeah its just right after Christmas that one was kind of hard i think that was a hard time but
 	
 	
 		mountains uh-huh
 		oh they don't have that anymore
 	
 	
 		well they haven't since his grandmother died and i don't know if you know they they just continued it kind of while
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		she was still alive and
 		and uh just nobody's done anything about it since she passed away but i don't know i mean it was always nice but it was just kind of a hard time i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you have any other reunions
 	
 	
 		yeah um yeah my my side of the family usually has let's see i went to one at that was at my um actually it was in Layton and it was up my father's
 		grandfather's house where his mother had been raised a little bit of the time they've they've still got this old home in their family and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that uh uh it was really a fun one that was nice to get to know a lot of the people though that we don't know and we just had a big
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um they had big grill that they cooked chicken and what'd they have chicken and i guess ribs and then they just did they had a little program and they made a quilt and gave it away
 	
 	
 		hum
 		they didn't auction it or anything
 	
 	
 		um well they they um i think they drew names is what they did
 	
 	
 		oh oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		people well no they did auction it well people bought a ticket that's how they did it and then the person with the winning ticket got it and things like that and that was kind of a fun one yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 		with the one up to the up to Bear Lake do you uh do anything like genealogy or or anything like that
 	
 	
 		no we just goof off  just play yeah
 	
 	
 		oh  uh my family goes up to uh Cub River up to Willow Flat
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for three days every year i mean it's there's not as much to do up as there is up at Bear Lake but we just go and camp out and wade in the river and
 	
 	
 		now now is that the same time of year
 	
 	
 		no that's the fourth of July one that we go down to the cabin
 	
 	
 		no
 		okay because i it's is that kind of a family reunion too yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh yeah but but that's but the one that we go up to Bear Lake with my family is
 		the more more people come it's my father's and mother's children that go to that one
 	
 	
 		oh i see oh and
 	
 	
 		so but and then we have a great big Johnson one about every other year that we make that we make a quilt and sell it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then we'll we'll sell chances on it and then that pays for all of the mailing and everything that's concerned with it yeah it does it works out really good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh that's nice nice yeah
 		we have they've organized a um like a family i don't know just some family organization on my dad's side and we do we pay dues
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think this year we just paid like ten dollars and and then they sent have started sending out a news letter on people and and um you know somebody's gone to a lot of work and they've they're doing a real good job and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so oh yeah  i'm not good at things like that so
 	
 	
 		just wait till it falls in your lap huh  neither am i but it's really important i think to keep those connections
 	
 	
 		it is it is and i know there's been a lot of years we haven't gone and then when we do go it doesn't seem like we know anybody and so i think it is good to keep going and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and keep those family ties up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i i don't know we've the Waites had a reunion too but that that fell every other every other year but that fell through because people just wouldn't take charge and do it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so and maybe there's a time to let go too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah but that's that is kind of sad when uh nobody does want to do it yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i
 		uh-huh
 		but then people get involved in other things and involved in others you know but i think it's really important to keep the your generation and the earlier generation together
 	
 	
 		oh it is it is oh well and and so you just you have the two on
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 	
 	
 		either side but you didn't have the one this year is this the first year you didn't have it on your husband's side

 		oh i see oh
 	
 	
 		and and then the the summer one fourth of around the fourth of July
