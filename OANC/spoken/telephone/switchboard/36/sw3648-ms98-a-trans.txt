 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh subject is gun control uh do you own any guns
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh besides a a a BB gun no um a lot of my family owns a lot of guns and stuff and
 		i i have a lot of friends that do also a lot of my friends are really into guns as far as knowing the specifications of every gun there is just about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i know the sort
 		i'm not much into guns myself either i don't know i enjoy working with them from time to time but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um personal opinion there's a whole lot of weapons available on the market that really shouldn't be available at all
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's my opinion is that some of these high powered handguns need to go out the window because they're obviously not for hunting
 	
 	
 		um yeah they've got
 	
 	
 		and a handgun was never designed for hunting
 	
 	
 		well very few of them it they do make some for bird hunting but still those aren't real high powered they're just you know small caliber with a long barrel on them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh no these and and these assault weapons with
 		real short stock short barrels and
 	
 	
 		yeah these these the the nine millimeter the nine millimeter Glock to to top the charts
 	
 	
 		armor piercing ammunition
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a plastic automatic weapon that fires
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they sell them here at Wal-Mart
 		three different models of Glock yeah
 	
 	
 		Wal-Mart
 		wow wow
 	
 	
 		Wal-Mart sporting goods department here in town carries carries the Glock
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		they haven't got the the latest version but uh they've got them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		something like seventeen rounds in a double wide clip
 	
 	
 		seventeen seventeen rounds of clip that fires by itself
 	
 	
 		craziness like that
 		practically yeah
 	
 	
 		did did you hear about the the killing spree in Colleen over here in Texas
 	
 	
 		no no i didn't
 	
 	
 		we had a guy that went through a Luby's in Colleen and like killed twenty three people and injured a hundred plus others
 	
 	
 		Luby's
 	
 	
 		and then killed himself
 	
 	
 		what's a Luby's
 	
 	
 		uh it's a cafeteria or restaurant
 	
 	
 		oh wait yeah uh uh that's been several months ago
 	
 	
 		yeah several several months ago yeah
 	
 	
 		okay yeah i did hear about that
 		and they weren't the least bit sure what happened what what set him off
 	
 	
 		that's
 		that's what well nobody really knows what it was it was they determined that it was a a series of events over the years of some sort form of hatred of women and that's why he was mostly shooting women
 	
 	
 		oh see i hadn't heard anything about you know what the bulk of his victims were but
 	
 	
 		uh he was just a wacko
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that shows you what a a a Glock automatic weapon will do
 	
 	
 		that's what he was using
 	
 	
 		yeah he had that and uh one other gun which i don't recall what it was
 	
 	
 		was it a rifle or a pistol
 	
 	
 		but
 		the Glock oh the other gun it was another handgun
 	
 	
 		no no the the other gun
 		okay no i hadn't i i hadn't heard what it was he was carrying all i knew is he'd been in there shooting i hadn't heard any about what he was carrying
 	
 	
 		yeah it was that's what it was he went around putting holes in anything he wanted to at whatever rate of speed he felt like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i do know they have uh fast uh fast recovery
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh goodness
 		well uh they
 	
 	
 		i i i also agree with the uh the seven day wait on handguns that's a
 	
 	
 		yeah probably ought to be longer than that really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		seven is probably as long as you can expect the law to to require
 	
 	
 		yeah at at the moment they want seven days and that's you know that's the best thing we got to work with go for it
 	
 	
 		yeah seven day wait waiting period and the check through the FBI files and
 	
 	
 		yeah because i i really can't understand why these legislatures wanna fight it unless they just don't have anything better to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they ought to carry they ought anybody with a permit to carry a gun uh you ought to have a permit for any kind of gun you carry period
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whether it's pistol or rifle or it doesn't matter and the permit
 		you ought a ought to be required to keep it in your billfold at all times whether you got your gun with you or not like a driver's license
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you should have a a a permit to use it and a uh be trained on how to use it
 	
 	
 		yeah uh it's part of the problem with guns in general they got hundreds out there you know the only experience they got is the you know the last couple times they got about half looped and went out and the gun and went out in the woods and started blowing up bottles
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		every hunting season scares the stew out of me even just to drive by a section of woods bothers me a little bit because i know there's maniacs out there the first couple of days
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 		my my dad has borrowed a uh thirty thirty from uh
 		his uh nephew and is supposed to go hunting and i i'm really really kind of nervous about it myself because i don't want him to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		go out there and get hurt
 	
 	
 		hm later on in the season it gets to be less of a problem especially
