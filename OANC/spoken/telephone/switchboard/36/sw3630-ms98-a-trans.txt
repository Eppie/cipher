 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well let's see if i can recall all those questions um
 		well first off i have one daughter who's two
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the question i think focused primarily on how people spend time with their children and is it adequate
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think that's so varied depending on um
 		what what your life is all about you know i i was just about to say priorities but it really has more to do with um the things that influence your life as opposed to just your priorities
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i work as well as um
 		spend as much time as i can with my daughter my husband so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's always a challenge um
 		i think that probably we like to spend our time together doing um recreational things as much as possible
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean that's sort of obvious i guess when you have a young child anyway they're not
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they're not off on their own they're going where you're going
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um so we enjoy things like camping and spending time together on weekends and going for walks and bike rides and things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		cool i think that's what it's all about that's i the things i remember most when i was growing up were the same that
 		anytime we did something with the family it was boring or something active we rarely went to any movies or and and i'm glad we took that time that we were together to to really spend in communicating and talking with one another and enjoying each other's company
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		did you have a lot of siblings
 	
 	
 		i do i have seven brothers and sisters there's eight of us
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so it was a challenge you know to find time especially as we got older um to find time to where we all could could do it but
 		it was also a lot of fun it really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		this i think for us it made it that although we didn't spend a whole lot of time together as a complete family
 	
 	
 		well that's probably a challenge considering the age span
 	
 	
 		yeah well there's a huge age span for example my oldest sister is twenty four and my youngest brother is six so
 	
 	
 		yeah oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		most the activities we did do together were were sports when one of us played in a sporting event it
 		everyone who was available would go to that or once somebody sang in a choir
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh well i would imagine at a certain point too you were probably able to care for each other in in like pseudo parent roles so that you had a chance to
 	
 	
 		so I think that's what i remember most
 		yeah
 		yeah and a lot of uh you know that was a big thing i remember when i was growing up that as soon as i could drive my job was to take over mom's car responsibilities and
 		drive everybody all around But that was cool because it gave us a chance to to get to know the other kids and really see how they were like instead of just what they were like at home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which was really neat
 	
 	
 		interesting
 		
 
 		and my little one wants to talk on the telephone right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		she sees me talking
 	
 	
 		how old is the little one
 	
 	
 		she's two
 	
 	
 		oh boy keeps you busy i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		i would guess she keeps you pretty busy
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's it's a
 		it's an age of um
 		extremes to some degree very loving and very sensitive and and yet sometimes just so overwhelmed by the emotions that uh hard to keep them in check
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		i can imagine
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well let's see what else
 	
 	
 		but the question of was it enough you know it think that's a really hard thing for people to answer i think that it depends on each individual
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i agree a hundred percent
 	
 	
 		if you feel as though you're spending enough i mean some people can work full time and feel like they're able to spend enough time with their kids and other people
 		can't imagine how that could be truth
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think it's true i think a lot of times
 		people get caught up on the quantity instead of the quality
 	
 	
 		uh-huh huh
 	
 	
 		and i'd just as spoon soon spend you know thirty minutes with my dad talking and just being with him than i would an hour and a half being at a movie with him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh did you have times when you were  um
 		like going on a date or having an opportunity to spend one on one with parents given that there were so many siblings did you have much one to one time
 	
 	
 		um when i was growing up there wasn't a whole lot most of our one on one was was with other brothers and sisters
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um more now than ever i i'm home for school right from school right now just for Christmas and i've probably spent more one on one time with my dad since i've been home than i did in the year when i was here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which was at times that was difficult you know we he made time when we needed it
 		but he's a very very busy person He works his job and a half and he's on the school board and everything so he's he's rarely home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but when he is he makes sure that it's quality time with us and he wants to you we always knew that that he was there for us if we needed him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's an important element of a relationship even if it's not always contact
 	
 	
 		yeah and i
 	
 	
 		must have kept your mom busy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they they were both run wild there i don't know how they did it
 	
 	
 		really it's pretty amazing when you look on so many families some time back that were larger it's very much the unusual today
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah and i think it's interesting too You know i think to me at least to have a big family is something that i personally will want when i get married
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		just because i i was able to see the what happens with other siblings
 		you know and be a i had to learn to be responsible real quick being the second oldest
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh is that right you were second
 	
 	
 		yeah so I got to
 	
 	
 		yeah besides the fact that you really uh learn to function in the social system you know it's the family unit is a is a microcosm
 	
 	
 		absolutely
