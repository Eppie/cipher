 
     		
 	
 		and they're talking about uh federal government aren't they
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm sure well actually probably any government but
 		the federal one's the big one
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so uh so what do you what do you think in the short term we should be doing to to improve it
 	
 	
 		well i saw a program on it recently and and it said everywhere time they cut you know like fifty five million dollars on a certain thing
 		then
 		they brag about how much money they cut and then they go and spend that money somewhere else and that's why the budget is never balanced
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		The Gramm Rudman Act didn't solve the problem they just take all the money that they say they cut and they spend it somewhere else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or they you know they pad out their staff or you know spend it in bounced checks at the commissary or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh ah yeah i'm getting pretty kind of disgusted with the uh um the  you know the fact that they're counting um a reduced deficit as being some big step
 		right i mean first of all we're we're we were about ready to hit the largest deficit i mean this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever
 		and two a deficit is i mean the deficit is only uh is  as as far from a balanced budget you reduce the deficit you you're still not you're still not you're still overspending
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		right i mean it's it's just the amount that you're overspending and and this is you know and for some reason
 		uh the way that the reporting is going on now it seems like like the uh the goal is to reduce the deficit to some you know still outrageous amount um
 		yeah i i i think in the long term something is going to have to be done with uh
 		sort of the the uh
 		well i mean it's it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you've got
 		um people you know trying to trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh there isn't any sort of overall
 		accountability and and uh
 		i don't know i guess i suppose that that that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're gonna have is is is
 		exposure and information and and i don't know that that in in general the American people are that interested you know to listen to to as much uh uh
 		you know i mean you're gonna have to know what people are doing and uh you know and how
 		and how how partisan and how  and how self interested their their motives are and and take it to task for it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because uh it's not gonna get solved if you know if people are still trying to you know like besides like you were saying you said you know where you
 		uh hey we just you know we just cut defense let me grab some of this money for my state now and then we can throw in some highway bill or we can throw in some you know some other kind of thing
 		and uh it's a pretty vicious uh vicious cycle
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		well i think they should they should limit the Senate to one term one six year term
 	
 	
 		that yeah that's being batted around i uh my my dad was always a proponent a proponent of that he uh he felt that that would
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		get people involved who were who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants yeah
 	
 	
 		right and and don't let them come back and and uh keep Congress to um two terms and two years a piece and then it'll be overturning and they won't have the same people there all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks and and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and because that's one of the things one of the biggest things is that um the fact that
 		they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another whether it's the oil companies or the automotive companies and like the air bag thing the air bag came out what twenty years ago
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and only now they're getting it put in cars you know and the oil companies aren't really aren't responsible you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		the Valdez proved that and then the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything it should've been done immediately
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah  yeah i think i think that that's probably right because in terms of long term you you just got to get people
 		um i mean  at one point at least on a local level um
 		going into politics is you know what you're doing is is really trying to serve the community right i mean you don't expect to make any money out of it you know maybe you gain a little bit of local fame but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it's uh you put in a lot of work in exchange for that and and i don't have the feeling that national level politicians are are at all like that you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		no they listen to wherever the money is
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh you know and i think that the the the problem with having you know junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with uh
 		you know with inept inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with the public
 	
 	
 		right  yeah they're not as efficient that's for sure
 	
 	
 		but on the other hand maybe that's in a lot of them
