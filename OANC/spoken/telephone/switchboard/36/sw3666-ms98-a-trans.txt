 		and i edge it occasionally
 	
 	
 		oh that's really good
 	
 	
 		yeah see am i good or what
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh i uh much much beyond that i don't do
 	
 	
 		i don't do any of that
 		really well i call my lawn man Eric whatever his name is i can't remember who's gonna come and build me a fence too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh he is gonna through fence
 	
 	
 		well he's gonna give me an estimate and for ten dollars a week i don't see any reason for me to be doing it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		what for a fence
 	
 	
 		no for my yard
 	
 	
 		oh well i thought isn't he the same one
 	
 	
 		yeah he is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but ten dollars
 		or what is what does he charge not even that what does he charge me it's like next to nothing  it's ten because i it's forty a month but if there's five weeks i still pay forty
 	
 	
 		what am i i don't know
 		yeah
 		yeah but you know you ought to get him to go pull the weeds
 	
 	
 		well he won't pull weeds he says he'll spray them but he won't pull them
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh he won't cut them is what he won't do because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the trimmer over the rocks and he's right that's true but he just says to keep spraying them so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well so
 	
 	
 		anyway Gene sprayed them once or twice for me so
 	
 	
 		yeah so you haven't you haven't pulled any weeds lately
 	
 	
 		that was free
 		no no there are two out front i thought i'd grab one of these days but i haven't bothered as i walk on by
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i start to pull the weeds in the rocks out front and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds and there was dog dirt in it
 	
 	
 		oh oh goody
 	
 	
 		and i threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there and i left the whole thing and that was about a month ago
 	
 	
 		i thought you were going to say there i thought you gonna say there was a snake in the weeds
 	
 	
 		i would rather a snake
 	
 	
 		oh God oh
 	
 	
 		no
 		i just left the whole thing the bag is still out there because i haven't touched it i haven't gone back over there it really made me mad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh God
 	
 	
 		so anyway but
 	
 	
 		but uh how are your your flowers your little things you planted did they die or what
 	
 	
 		oh yeah now they died
 	
 	
 		oh they're all so they oh are they going to come back in the spring
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't know and then i got some nice uh mums at Thanksgiving that i put in the pots out there and i thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas then they started to die too
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i don't think any of it comes back but i don't know maybe sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't know uh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		those flowers remember those little ones you gave me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well they're i know they were still blooming up until about a a few weeks ago
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's good they're the best kind they they're like indestructible
 	
 	
 		yeah they
 		they're really pretty
 	
 	
 		they really grow nice and sometimes they're not supposed to come back but lots of times they do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we'll see
 		they're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they but that's because we didn't hit one for a long time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes
 		we didn't disconnect did we
 	
 	
 		i hope not  neither one of us is getting paid for this
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i hate to think i hate to think i'd be talking to you without getting paid
 	
 	
 		yeah really i know it i can't believe this i got somebody from Utah
