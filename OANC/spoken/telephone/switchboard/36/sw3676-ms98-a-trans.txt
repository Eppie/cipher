 		uh  it's been probably
 		a month or so since i've been to the movies uh
 		course my my favorite now is is Dances With Wolves
 	
 	
 		oh it's an excellent movie
 	
 	
 		uh
 		Silence of the Lan uh of the Lambs was good
 	
 	
 		Silence of the Lambs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what was that anyway because i didn't get a chance to see it
 	
 	
 		oh it's a
 		i guess it's a mystery you'd call it it's with uh Jodie Foster
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and it uh
 		it's pretty good another one that i think i really liked was uh The Fisher King
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		let's see who was in Fisher King
 		that was um
 		Robin Williams and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um i can't say the other fellow's name
 	
 	
 		how about you what are you
 	
 	
 		uh we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately um we really enjoyed um
 		Dead Poet's Society
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um several years back when we saw uh we saw the we really really enjoyed was uh Ordinary People
 		with um
 		Timothy Hutton and uh Mary Tyler Moore and uh
 		uh who played the father anyway excellent movie
 	
 	
 		right that was that was an excellent movie have you seen Dances With Wolves
 	
 	
 		yes we have
 	
 	
 		that what'd you think of it
 	
 	
 		oh we loved it
 	
 	
 		i don't think i can see it enough times
 	
 	
 		i know what you mean i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		course i'm a Kevin Costner fan
 	
 	
 		yeah um pretty impressed with stuff he's done uh he made kind of an odd sounding Robin Hood but uh
 		i mean you know basic  thick western US accent for a Robin Hood just doesn't seem to fit
 		but
 	
 	
 		no but you know it wasn't bad movie it got such bad reviews really and and i thoroughly enjoyed it but i then i wasn't expecting any classic either
 	
 	
 		oh no it was a good movie
 		well um they did a real good job with it
 	
 	
 		i thought so
 	
 	
 		um they didn't try to make him super human or you know invincible
 		they just
 		he worked hard at it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have you seen The Fisher King
 	
 	
 		no i haven't not had the opportunity to see that uh
 	
 	
 		uh it you
 		you know i guess it it really isn't for everybody it's it's pretty deep and and uh
 		uh philosophical
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i thought it had a wonderful message to it it's kind you came out
 		and looked at somebody says you know i think i liked that  and then the more you got to thinking about it the more you thought you know i did like it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but when you first came out you weren't real sure
 	
 	
 		it sounds kind of like one uh we saw at home here on the we rented it um Clara's Heart
 	
 	
 		haven't seen that
 	
 	
 		um it's Whoopi Goldberg
 	
 	
 		oh yes i did yes i did
 	
 	
 		yeah she played a uh
 		they um
 	
 	
 		uh nanny the nanny type
 	
 	
 		she was a housekeeper yeah she's a housekeeper she
 	
 	
 		housekeeper uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she was um
 		oh no i can't say it not Haitian
 		anyway
 		she uh
 		she seemed to be that sort of person that you know about seems half crazy but then again she's got a whole lot on the ball and the movie had the whole uh a lot of philosophical content more than
 		more than you know it it wasn't a mystery it wasn't a you know blood and guts and violence and and and car chases type thing
 		it was just a good movie
 	
 	
 		i saw one the other day that was A Kiss Before Dying
 	
 	
 		a Kiss Before Dying
 	
 	
 		um-hum i had not heard about it when it was on the movies but was out on video
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's with Sean Young
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's a it's a mystery it was very predictable i mean you knew you knew when the murder was gonna happen or something but it was still so well done
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that it was enjoyable
 	
 	
 		that's that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable but still worth watching
 	
 	
 		that's right  i had uh
 		oh uh i like the
 		i think it's called the uh
 		
 
 		Razor's Edge
 		the
 		no no the Jagged Edge the Jagged Edge
 	
 	
 		not familiar with that one
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		with uh
