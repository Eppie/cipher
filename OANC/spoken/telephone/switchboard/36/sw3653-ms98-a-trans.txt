 
     		
 	
 		are you in the market for a new car
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um well actually about six months ago we were uh but it was kind of a different type deal we had uh a large conversion van that and we're looking to sell it too
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh to get a smaller car  but but when i was looking for the van we were looking around quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh you need to  down
 		uh-huh and did you were you happy with the van you found
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah as a matter of fact the reason we sold the van was just so that my wife could stay home with our two boys now
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we got rid of that big payment and so now she now she's a stay at home mom
 	
 	
 		right right
 		did they use a lot of gas those vans
 	
 	
 		um
 		it did fairly well for me uh i got about fifteen sixteen
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that is pretty good
 	
 	
 		in in the that's combination city and highway driving and then on the open road i can get about nineteen or twenty
 	
 	
 		oh that
 		oh yeah that is nice i thought they used a lot more gas than that ah
 	
 	
 		hum-um yeah you would think it'd be a lot worse i know mini vans don't get much better than that they get about twenty one twenty two
 	
 	
 		no
 		right around there oh well that's interesting we are just in the opposite situation of you we're looking for something bigger  we have four children we just had
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		ah
 		ah
 	
 	
 		a new baby and so the car that we have only has the five seat belts and we need you know when we're all going in it we need six
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we're looking for something bigger and i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know we have a little Honda car that my husband uses it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to commute back and forth to work and it has been it almost has two hundred thousand miles
 	
 	
 		wow  you got your use out of that
 	
 	
 		right and it's been such a good car but i wish they made Hondas with the six seat belts i i don't i don't think they make them that big
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		no i don't think so
 	
 	
 		and i i'm not sure that i'm ready for a van yet
 	
 	
 		yeah i have looked at some of the uh Toyota Toyota makes a real nice van i i like theirs a lot
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh but if you really want size you know the prices are about the same depend you know you can spend as much on a mini van as you do on a full size conversion van
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and the difference is the the conversion of course the mileage is a little bit worse
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but because you do have a bigger engine and bigger transmission you can pull stuff like trailers and boats and stuff easier than you can with a you know the other mini van
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh oh are there a lot of vans down there my brother lives in Plano Texas and he said there's vans all over the place
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah yeah just lots and lots of vans
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so that's i was kind of i my preference would to be just to go to a bigger car i think rather than rather than a van but you know even that is it's hard to find a car that is big enough i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the problem we have now is our car it doesn't have a bench seat up front so if we had the bench seat then we would be fine but when we bought it we
 	
 	
 		oh it doesn't yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we didn't get the bench seat up front so
 	
 	
 		yeah well i don't know if you'd be how how old is your oldest
 	
 	
 		eight uh-huh
 	
 	
 		eight yeah see i i don't know how long you'd be happy like that
 		well i don't know how often all all six of you all will be in the car but i know that once you get one or two car seats in there
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		that takes up  a lot of room
 	
 	
 		ah and then that yeah then you'd have your eight year old you'd probably have your eight year old up front on the bench seat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but even even then after a while you'd feel cramped especially if it was ah you know a fairly long trip in more than about an hour
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true
 		that's true i haven't i haven't thought about that because is there a lot more room in the regular size vans than in a car
 	
 	
 		uh oh yes definitely you you know a station wagon the back end of a station wagon probably can carry as much as a van but as for passenger space
 		ah you can't beat a van because you can you can you can carry seven in a van and that's a mini van
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		on a large conversion van you can you know you can carry a lot you can carry about nine
 	
 	
 		oh so now why did you go with a large conversion van when you went
 	
 	
 		well because for what i wanted in a van the mini vans were were about a thousand dollars less
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you get almost twice the room in the conversion van than you do in the mini van
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		plus like i said all the extra pulling power and i didn't feel i was losing that much on gas mileage because they're not that far off
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		right did you buy it new was it
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a new one uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh and that's only about a thousand dollars difference
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i was really surprised
 	
 	
 		yeah that surprises me too
 	
 	
 		because because when you you know you can like pick Dodge for instance they got two sizes of mini vans one's the extra long and then the other the extra long option with all the power options you know windows locks and the nice stereo
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was only about fifteen hundred less than the comparable full size van
 	
 	
 		my word
 	
 	
 		and you know like i said uh the mileage on a mini van is about oh twenty one twenty two on the highway and on the you know on the full size it was nineteen twenty
 	
 	
 		nineteen so that's still comparable
 	
 	
 		and that's nothing yeah so you know i i said you know given that i said
 	
 	
 		wow
