 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		think the Cowboys are gonna go further or is this the end of the line
 	
 	
 		no i think the Cowboys have a good chance to really um
 		possibly take it all the way they're one of the they're one of two teams that actually beat Washington Redskins
 		ah however Washington has been uh
 		what do you call it has been resting up
 		and uh that could really hurt the Cowboys especially if they have a lot of injuries coming into uh  the next two games
 	
 	
 		well there was a uh article in the Wall Street Journal
 		oh a couple weeks ago before the play-offs started and it said their long shot prediction was Cowboys versus Oilers in the Super Bowl
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		then they gave their reasons why they thought both of those teams had a
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		had a decent chance at it
 	
 	
 		well uh that would be an interesting game i think that game would be sold out what do you think
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think there'd be any problem there the only question is would the rest of the country be interested in watching two Texas teams slug it out
 	
 	
 		yes i think so because uh i think Warren Moon and uh Steve Beuerlein and Troy Aikman are some of the hottest quarterbacks for the uh for the nineteen nineties
 	
 	
 		yeah they'll probably want to see Emmett Smith and uh and uh see Novacek and see Irwin out there and and the no name defense so who knows
 	
 	
 		yeah the no name defense that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		well and then Houston's got a a good core of about good five good receivers out there that uh that Moon likes to likes to throw to
 	
 	
 		well did you see in the paper last Sunday about uh the salaries for the different um
 		uh players
 	
 	
 		yeah i sure did
 	
 	
 		well what do you think about uh
 		Montana being paid so much for not playing this year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well he he had himself a good contract
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know if he's got a contract that pays him regardless of injuries he's in good shape well you know that Michael Irvin's going to get a big boost and already uh Jones has said that uh they anticipate that he'll be giving Michael Irvin a big pay raise
 		so i think that'll be coming
 	
 	
 		sure
 		sure i think it will be too and i think Steve Beuerlein might get a little raise too he's uh
 		um Troy Aikman i wonder even though he's a real good player i wonder if he's going to be able to uh stand the physical abuse that the NFL offers he might not make it
 	
 	
 		well his problem is that he since he doesn't seem as mobile as some of the other quarterbacks he seems to get one bad injury every year so Beuerlein or someone like Beuerlein is going to be a necessity while Aikman's around
 	
 	
 		yep so what do you think about uh the games that's going to be played uh tomorrow Buffalo and
 		who they playing the uh
 	
 	
 		uh Buffalo's playing um Kansas City
 	
 	
 		Kansas City Chiefs
 	
 	
 		well i i really think Buffalo will will win the game i'll be surprised if Kansas City wins it
 		but uh Houston Denver um that one might be more even than than people would otherwise think i don't think that one's gonna be uh blow out for anybody it might be a pretty close game
 	
 	
 		yeah i think John Elway still has a hot hand the trouble is is sometimes it's cold
 		and uh he's not consistent he he has a good day he has a bad day
 	
 	
 		and you and you never know
 	
 	
 		um i like that these other quarterbacks that that are are more consistent i think Beuerlein has been more consistent
 	
 	
 		well Beuerlein's only had interceptions in one of the six games he's played and although he isn't throwing that many passes or completing that many you know if you're completing them to the right people at the right time you've got a running game you don't have to throw fifty times
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know you know we're watching the Bowl games yesterday and there's some amazing Bowl games
 		some of those guys'll be pros there's one fellow plays for my wife's school East Carolina named uh Jeff Blake and he's gonna  almost surely be drafted by the pros he had an incredible day yesterday
 	
 	
 		right
 		hm
 	
 	
 		he um threw for four touchdown passes and ran for one and
 		he had an amazing day he rallied the team down from seventeen points in the middle of the fourth quarter to score three unanswered touchdowns in less than six minutes it was an amazing performance
 	
 	
 		i missed the name who was that again
 	
 	
 		it was Jeff Blake B L A K E he's the quarterback East Carolina he's pretty well rewritten the record books and i guess the pros will pay a good attention to him
 	
 	
 		i didn't i didn't watch that game uh i did watch the Notre Dame game
 	
 	
 		well they certainly came from behind to pull it off didn't they
 	
 	
 		yes i i think that um
 		the coach there is uh really made a name for himself with Arkansas now with Notre Dame
 	
 	
 		well both those games were the only two exciting Bowl games yesterday i think the other six games were either blowouts or like the Cotton Bowl a disaster
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a low scoring game
 	
 	
 		but well it was it was a disaster a total disaster
 		well i don't i don't know about Detroit they they've got a lot of injuries they may have beaten the Cowboys thirty four to to ten
