 		so what well what do you think
 	
 	
 		well
 		providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task and i uh personally i don't approve of it for two reasons number one
 		is that i think that uh the federal government
 		has a problem with the deficit right now and if they were to administer this they would uh get us more and more into debt
 		further than we can ever get out ourselves number two i think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would
 		would be dried up and really no one would be would only answer to to the government to a big bureaucratic bureaucratic mess
 		and uh i've seen what it has done in other countries and so i don't think uh
 		i don't think we should head in that direction although that we have problems right now and i do agree that they exist because health care insurance for for everyone
 		is skyrocketing and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how do you feel about the whole whole ordeal
 	
 	
 		well i agree that it's a big task but i think that i think that the US should move towards some kind of national health care plan
 		at least as a long term kind of goal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know possibly
 		you know just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing but i think that ultimately it would be
 		a good idea to
 		um and not have a completely socialized
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		medical system in the country but maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it um just because it seems that
 		um health insurance costs are sky rocketing well as fast as the national deficit
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		perhaps and so that's
 		and that's a that's a vicious cycle of course
 	
 	
 		but what what you're think
 		yeah so what you're saying though is instead of having the national government government administer
 	
 	
 		because
 	
 	
 		giving health insurance to every man woman and child with throughout the whole company you see more of them as regulating the high costs
 		uh that people are forced to pay for it right now
 		is that is that correct or do you think that
 	
 	
 		um
 		well
 		i um
 		well i wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately i don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea
 		and
 		um
 	
 	
 		well with the with the costs as they are right now do you think that the government uh because what that would require is for us to pay uh more taxes and the
 		the income the people that can afford taxes the middle income and the upper income will be paying more cash taxes to to pay for health insurance for everyone whereas right now the the public themselves
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		get health insurance and they provide their own health insurance
 	
 	
 		the well as it is now the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance
 		and so that the other people have no health insurance and you know they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and somebody winds up paying for that and
 		basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance
 		so i do not see that anything
 		this situation would get any worse that way it might get better
 	
 	
 		you think it might be get better huh i i kind of disagree  the reason being is uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we have i don't know i guess it's my my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		rules that it would take to administer it and um
 		the the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and and uh don't allow
 		cases where they might throw them out of business whereas the federal government if they took over everything they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business people would still have to pay taxes the money would have to come from somewhere
 		and so you'd see i i feel that the cost would increase
 		dramatically also but in the same sense the the care and the the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical uh field
 		would would diminish
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think
