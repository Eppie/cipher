 		uh pets do you have pets
 	
 	
 		yes we do uh my wife and i have a dog that's soon be eight years old and we have a a cat which is uh i guess about five years old
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		how about you guys
 	
 	
 		we have a three dogs and two birds at this point parakeets
 	
 	
 		three dogs and two birds what kind of birds you have
 		no kidding enjoy enjoy them
 	
 	
 		oh have a ball with them
 	
 	
 		you let you let them out and let them fly around everything
 	
 	
 		well no because my dogs chase them  so if in order to have the birds not stuffed i have to keep them in their cages
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		we you know this is like a cruelty joke and i apologize if you're a bird lover but uh we had a parakeet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my fault put up our first electric fan and never thought about it knocked that parakreet right right out of the air
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well we had that happen once um my son had the bird back in his room because it's his bird well the first one that we had was his bird and
 		i had the ceiling fan put up and it the bird got away from him one afternoon and i mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall i thought oh so much for the bird no he's still alive and kicking
 	
 	
 		it kill it
 		oh that's no it killed ours i'll be darned
 	
 	
 		no i guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit in just the right spot but it threw him up against the wall you know and he slid down the wall
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well speaking of pets i'll tell you my my kids are older now my both of them are either in or out of college but
 		but we had for years about five years i guess had a my son had a Burmese boa constrictor and
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in in length and finally my wife's wife bless her heart got rid of it because i didn't really like it
 	
 	
 		oh i hate them
 	
 	
 		and we also had a one year down in Florida on a vacation for Father's Day my kids years ago maybe uh ten years ago go bought me a skunk from a like exotic pet shop it'd be like it'd had been like deactivated as far as uh
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		smell and everything and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years and and my son left
 		went to school we finally sold his boa constrictor but my son needed some money and we we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars so ah
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		so when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk so i made him a deal i said you take that skunk
 		and he said i'll sell that snake to you for two fifty i said otherwise i'm gonna give it to this other man so he took the skunk too and the skunk was a good a decent pet but you know it does its little jobbies in the litter box and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		and it was sort of a neat but they just stink too much
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that was sort of fun you i  tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover
 		i used to visualize my wife for  many times my wife be lying there on the sofa and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with with its with its head right on her neck
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and the skunk would be sitting at her feet
 		that the cat would be on the back of the sofa and a dog be running around crazy  oh
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh i can not imagine i just i don't do my in fact my brother has a uh
 		a exotic pet shop out in California and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail you know i'm going don't do that because they won't come in my house
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		oh my son bought this snake uh  someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school and it was just a small thing then but it got to be pretty big and you know you'd feed it you can put and feed him that small mice to big rats and things like that and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's just uh too much that snake used to watch our cat walk around i always told my wife i said you know what your friend's gonna get our cat one of these days
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh yeah that's right oh my gosh that is wild oh i just can't do those and the lizards and the
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh me neither
 	
 	
 		all of those things ugh they they need to stay outside far away from me
 	
 	
 		we're down to a simple dog and cat now and that's the way it should be and haven't had any parakeets for quite a while or birds uh customer of mine has a parrot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot and that was just mind boggling
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they are so expensive
 		well my son was just dying for a bird and i'm really allergic to them so i i tried to stay away from them except i've gotten real attached to this one and and uh we went down to Canton one time oh gosh
 	
 	
 		are you
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		two or three years ago now and he'd saved up his allowance you know and picked him out a bird and a bird cage and and that stinking bird when i brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		clamped onto my finger and would not i mean i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage and he has tried to bite me for two years and all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends he'll gives me kisses he talks now
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		that's neat
 	
 	
 		and it's just hysterical i'm the only one that pays attention to him
 	
 	
 		why sure
 	
 	
 		and i'm a substitute teacher and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said my mom's making me get rid of the bird we have too many pets i thought yeah right come tell me about it you know
 	
 	
 		come to my menagerie
 	
 	
 		they knew the sucker when they saw one so now we have two parakeets
