 
     		
 	
 		kind of a heavy topic tonight right about uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's you have to start the new year out by the way Happy New Year
 	
 	
 		thank you same to you
 		what do you think about the uh  that idea that they're recommending for the young people
 	
 	
 		i hadn't really heard that before um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i had at one point thought about doing the Peace Corps myself many years ago um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know many years ago it seemed like they had uh um involuntary enlistment and mainly like in the fifties i know a lot of uh men that were into the military you had to go into the military
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		i don't know about that a lot of people i don't think would like it because it's gonna interrupt college plans but a lot of people don't have plans so for them it might give them a little help to uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		get uh some kind of more awareness about the world and be of some use for a while
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i i personally think it would be a a good idea
 		um  i have kind of a same well it's not a really a Peace Corps experience it's a little bit similar
 		you may assume that being from Utah member a member of the Mormon church and we do a lot of missionary work and i spent two years when i was nineteen in Argentina
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh i'll tell you that gives you a different perspective of uh you know some of the things we have here in this country that uh people really uh don't appreciate
 		and seeing a different culture and uh getting to know a kind of a different a different people i think was a good experience for anyone regardless of uh
 		you know their particular  endeavor they're engaged  engaged in i think just getting out of the country is a great benefit to anyone so have you ever lived abroad or spent anytime outside of the United States
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i haven't no but um i had known of the Peace Corps because i had a cousin in the Peace Corps course you know it was much more publicized in the sixties i don't even know if they have it today
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i had a friend though in the seventies join uh Vista
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is a similar program although you stay within the US which can be very beneficial too i mean a lot of times there's a lot of help we can do within the US um and that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh sure you bet
 	
 	
 		it program i thought was excellent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i just don't think they even i don't know if they have those programs anymore or if they even try to publicize it and recruit and i think that's a shame because both of those programs programs are excellent and uh hopefully don't
 	
 	
 		and i it seems like they excuse me but it seems like they used to advertise it on TV in the the Peace Corps
 	
 	
 		i don't remember i just i haven't seen it recently
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		not that you know not down here any i don't  i don't remember seeing anything about Vista or or the Peace Corps recently
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i think it would be a good idea is a it is kind of a delicate time but
 		by the same token at that age they haven't really settled down don't have a family or other commitments as well and so there's some divantages to going at that particular time in your life
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and uh well well  i think
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it would be extremely beneficial to just about everybody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i i could see that there'd be some people that you know would throw up their arms about it and go i'm going to Harvard and i you know this isn't something i wanna do but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh you're right it would give everybody a better perspective of uh you know ourselves and what we have maybe make us appreciate  what we have a little more so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's that's certainly my was my experience just uh
 		it was like the the uh clock had been turned back about ten or fifteen years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know just the difference in the technologies in the two countries the  kinds of cars they drove the you know simple things like  central heating and uh
 		and having a gas fired um water heater you know things that that we really appreciate are are not commonplace in in every uh in every uh city that i was uh living in
 	
 	
 		um
 		right i had uh twice now been a big sister  you've heard of big brothers big sisters
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i have had uh two little sisters and even though they were local to me it was almost being in a different world because both of my sisters little sisters came from very poor backgrounds
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and of course they don't have usually normal families i mean  there's not a a mother and a father and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		they live in pretty poor housing and um their education is very lacking because their parents you know don't uh  encourage them to go to school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um so that was beneficial to me as well as the child because uh made me appreciate my background a little more and i helped to give this person
 		um  a more one on one idea of there can be a different life than what they've had and it to uh experience some things that otherwise they wouldn't be able to get out and do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah  is that uh a program where you're you uh commit for a certain number of  months or or you you're assigned a  a child and you you stay with them for as long as you can
 	
 	
 		it's usually a year um and they try to find somebody in the local area to you and um you know the age group that you wanna work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
