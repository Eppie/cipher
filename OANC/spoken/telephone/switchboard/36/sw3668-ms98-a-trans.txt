 
     		
 	
 		all right now then we should be ready to go with our conversation
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right
 	
 	
 		what are your preferences
 	
 	
 		i think i tend to prefer ethnic restaurants rather than steak houses or uh simply American food or or even the southwest food
 		uh frequently we enjoy trying a a new kind of a place and to try to see what their style of food is and what kind of spices and things they use in it
 		so that's what me we mostly do what do you prefer when you go out
 	
 	
 		oh i've decided there's so many places in Dallas i will not make too many repeats and i thoroughly enjoy the ethnic foods
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		yes certainly
 		course i perhaps would enjoy Tex-Mex
 		and that's uh a good Tex-Mex is awfully hard to beat do you prefer do you care for that flavor
 	
 	
 		oh yes really very much um i think that the Tex-Mex food has become a kind of a a standard enjoyed food in our home and i've
 		even learned to make a a few things at home myself and that's why i said sometimes when we go out i would
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		not because i don't like it but because we we tend to like it and even have it at home i'd rather try something else um-hum yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i i understand that uh but you don't care for the steaks
 	
 	
 		i'm not a big steak or rib or um roast beef eater although to be honest with you at holiday time at Christmas
 		i always buy a a standing prime rib and make some Yorkshire pudding and gravy and totally enjoy it and then can table that for six months to eight months to another year so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and you know we're trying not to eat those those big meats also with all of that health consciousness uh
 		believe me we're not fanatics in that line but uh if we enjoy other things then we'll we'll tend to go that way
 		a nice Chinese once in a while is is very tasty and um we recently went to an Ethiopian restaurant and uh sampled that kind of food rather different
 		but uh have you been to any place lately that you enjoyed
 	
 	
 		yes i found a little place over in uh Preston Center tonight it's uh called oh i don't have the matches now but it's a its a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Cafe au France and they had the it's a small place but most delightful i had not been there before
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		and then i found with a neighbor oh couple a about a month ago this uh Salvadorian
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that is on Six Thirty Five
 		in a i don't think it was Day's Inn Motel but this woman's son had been there two or three times and their food is excellent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		except for their fried banana now i do not care for that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh the the other things the seasonings were so appealing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh wait i have a call just a second
 	
 	
 		okay go ahead
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm sorry  i didn't know i'd have that one come in but anyway
 	
 	
 		that
 		okay
 	
 	
 		that was it was very good and very very reasonable
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		good service and the things that i look forward to i mean i want to be waited on i don't want to go cafeteria style
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	

 		i'd rather have them cater to me when i'm when i'm patronizing them and
 	
 	
 		um-hum when you go out i
 		um-hum i don't blame you i i think that's an important part of relaxing that you don't have to do the work yourself um-hum
 	
 	
 		the only time that i would go against that is would be the Sunday brunches that so many of the places have
 	
 	
 		oh
 		do you have a preference to a place for Sunday brunch
 	
 	
 		one that i have enjoyed and had the privilege of eating there New Year's Eve night was the Marriott on Six Thirty Five at Coit
 	
 	
 		oh yes i'm familiar with that um-hum
 	
 	
 		have you been there to eat
 	
 	
 		well i have not really been there to have the brunch um-hum
 	
 	
 		well they had a buffet dinner which was very similar
