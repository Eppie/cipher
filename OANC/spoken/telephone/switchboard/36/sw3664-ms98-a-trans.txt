 
     		
 	
 		what do you how what do you think of your news coverage and where do you get most of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh usually uh either TV or radio
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		it it seems like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		sometime uh we get the weekend paper but uh even then it just seems that sometimes you're so busy you don't wanna take an hour or so to sit down  the paper
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it's so much quicker just to hear you know hear it on the radio or watch TV
 	
 	
 		yes we don't go to bed at night  usually until we've seen the news at ten so that's probably well we do take a daily paper too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh you do uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum but it's out of Ogden and so it it's not very you know it's not probably as big as yours and sometimes i wonder about the newspaper coverages too anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		because i've known stories that have happened and then read it in the paper and it hasn't been all that accurate um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		not quite the same yeah and a lot of times when you have two different um papers you get two different stories
 	
 	
 		that's true although i think that's the same on TV too you know you'll get one you know one day and one the next day on the same thing and so but i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right  oh excuse me
 	
 	
 		i enjoy i enjoy the news i like to keep up on whatever's happening
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		it's just it's so much easier just to
 		you know listen to the radio in your car it seems like or just to sit down for a short while and watch the news than it is to sit down and you know i mean i'll read periodicals and stuff too but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		usually those come out after the fact and course they give you more information so if you want that then that's fine
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah well i think sometimes you know you'll hear it on TV and you want want to go into it deeper you uh you can get it in a magazine or a paper
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		a newspaper and then on the radio you know they usually uh give the news every hour
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i i like that too especially when we're traveling
 	
 	
 		right yeah i know that when i'm on vacation i am like seems like i'm totally out of it i don't know what's going on and i don't really care
 	
 	
 		so
 		well that's true too
 	
 	
 		it's kind of nice to get away from it all
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh but you know if there's a story that you're particularly interested in it's good to  to be able to follow up on it  you know so
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh  we have a a news station too that is  uh KSL out of Salt Lake that covers just it's a talk show and there's news almost constantly on it
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then CNN has news constantly too
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so do you have cable
 	
 	
 		no we don't so we don't watch CNN
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh  well we couldn't get TV here if we didn't have cable we live close to the mountain
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh the signal the signal doesn't come because we're kind of behind a mountain
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so we couldn't get it if we didn't have cable cable in fact we've when we first moved out here for the first probably twenty years we couldn't it was really snowy
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		our reception and you know we'd watch it and the kids would watch it but it wasn't all that good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		so you figured might as well get the cable huh
 	
 	
 		yeah well  we were glad when it came but it just keeps going up in price too so that's kind of detriment too
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but we've thought of getting a satellite so that we could get more stations but uh it wouldn't i don't know
 	
 	
 		now that'll be nice
 	
 	
 		yeah but i don't think we're gonna to do it because it's uh you can't get local stations and that's the news that we're mostly interested in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		and back to news flash from our high school today we have one high school in town and they had to evacuate it because the furnace was acting up and was threatening to blow up
 	
 	
 		oh is that right i bet the kids were happy
 	
 	
 		yeah they i think they were
 	
 	
 		yeah well we had uh i don't know if your son told you but we had two papers here in Dallas and now we just have the one
 	
 	
 		we saw it on TV before he told us
 	
 	
 		oh okay so that'll probably make a difference in the reporting
 	
 	
 		yeah does uh how much does your newspapers cost
 	
 	
 		they are um on the weekends gosh um let me see i've got this on Sunday it's a dollar
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and during the week i'm not really sure how much it is it's probably i guess you know seventy five cents or so i would think
 	
 	
 		um-hum ours is eight dollars a month so how would that figure up with what you'd do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but you get it every day don't you oh so that's that's really good then
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes it's kind of a  skinny newspaper except when the ads you know like at Christmas time or Thanksgiving or
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so it's uh but we i enjoy it i'd hate to be without a newspaper and then we get the local you know the little Brigham City one it's uh comes once a week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that must uh do you have a hard time keeping up with it
 		reading everything
 	
 	
 		keep
 		no
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good
 	
 	
 		no but
