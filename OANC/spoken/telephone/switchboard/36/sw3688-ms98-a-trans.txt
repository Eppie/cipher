 		i been to Charleston
 	
 	
 		Charleston West Virginia
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay that's pretty much the south end of the state or the southern quarter of the state anyway
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		okay in the north end of the state you got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's yeah that's interesting so it's really up north in the country really uh it's i guess uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's well uh my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far
 	
 	
 		gosh i see
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		pretty nice country up there
 	
 	
 		oh it's beautiful
 	
 	
 		hills or what
 	
 	
 		uh well from my neck of the woods it's hilly um you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh maybe three hundred four hundred feet elevation
 		uh that type
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		variations from the valleys up to the hills to hilltops
 	
 	
 		is it a farmland
 	
 	
 		um
 		not a lot of farmland there mostly it's uh i mean you know there's you know individuals with their own own farm uh growing their own food
 		uh most of the agriculture it's more in the way of uh sheep and cattle
 	
 	
 		oh yes um-hum
 	
 	
 		and even that's you know small time mostly uh the biggest chunk of what's going on there is is uh industries coal mines and chemical plants and power plants
 	
 	
 		sure
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh aluminum plants there's like two aluminum plants with you know
 	
 	
 		what are you  what are you studying there at Hattiesburg
 	
 	
 		computer engineering
 	
 	
 		oh yeah what year
 	
 	
 		uh just finished up my fourth semester
 	
 	
 		well great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i hope that works out well
 	
 	
 		it it's a big change
 		i spent twenty years as a mechanic so yeah
 	
 	
 		was
 		oh did you
 		well you've got some experience behind you in the work force
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah are you uh shooting for a bachelor's now or master's or what
 	
 	
 		i'm working on a bachelor's degree
 	
 	
 		all right okay good
 	
 	
 		i'm working on a bachelor's degree it'll be computer
 	
 	
 		hope it's a good program there
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		hope it's a good program there
 	
 	
 		uh it seems to me from what i've been able to find out that's considered a pretty good program it's nice and small which means you know
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah good
 	
 	
 		if you don't get the class this semester then you got to wait three or four semester you know anywhere from two to four semesters to get it again but uh it's it's worth it once you get it
 	
 	
 		hum
 		well yes that's good and probably a good uh student teacher ratio and things yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah most the class is pretty small
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		that works out real well
 	
 	
 		well i was wondering what if you all were to get a pet like if you were to move into an apartment or a house somewhere what would you get
 	
 	
 		uh well um
 		first off we'd probably wind up with a uh cat or maybe a puppy uh i'm partial towards the larger dogs um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		our last we we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus uh had a hamster or two they were they got to be a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		a hamster um oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it's amazing how much character you can
