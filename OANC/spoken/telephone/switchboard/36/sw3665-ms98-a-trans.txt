 
     		
 	
 		okay um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		some of the TV shows i like to watch are um mostly evening evening shows and uh like for instance the one i'm looking forward to to tonight is Twenty Twenty
 		i usually watch those prime time programs
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i like to watch Forty Eight Hours never miss that and uh sometimes Prime Time Live um
 		and then the week goes by and i don't think ever watch anything else you know the the Sunday night movies i watch those kind of things
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh mostly but basically a lot of documentary things and you know what's going on and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		i like i have a few you know favorite shows that i try not to miss L A Law is one of them although this year's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's a little easier to miss than last year with the new cast and everything and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's hard to follow
 	
 	
 		right and uh i like Rosie O'Neil
 	
 	
 		oh i've never seen that one
 	
 	
 		The Trials of Rosie O'Neil with Sharon Gleese
 	
 	
 		okay yeah i've seen a uh the previews for that
 	
 	
 		she
 		it's very good it it's probably very much a woman's movie uh show
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh and then there's a new sitcom on that is Tim Allen's uh what is it uh Handyman that's not what uh Home Improvement
 	
 	
 		oh we never miss that or we try not to miss that
 	
 	
 		it's hysterical isn't it  did you catch the Christmas
 	
 	
 		oh we think it is so funny
 		oh i just part of it
 	
 	
 		i thought it was you know and it had such a good story too did you see the end of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no
 	
 	
 		well you know the little boy the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh that's right and the neighbor they thought it was the neighbor
 	
 	
 		they thought it was the neighbor and he gave the two doubting Thomases a rubber band and a paper clip
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i thought that was wonderful
 	
 	
 		and then uh it it's it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor
 	
 	
 		and uh on Sunday used to be on Sunday nights now i can't figure out where they've moved it on our uh public television they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it showed the latest uh developments from all the computer companies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i've never seen that program
 	
 	
 		well you know it's unless you're really into computers you wouldn't and software you probably wouldn't be interested but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know what
 		
 
 		uh they they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets you know and then they also the hardware
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so you you could see what the new developments were and what to look for and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i enjoyed that it was just a thirty minute show with no commercials
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		it's public television course doesn't have the commercials during the show so
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		and i like the Frugal Gourmet
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh i do too uh but i just seem to to miss a lot of these programs i don't know why i just
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		if i can catch them i do or if i remember
 	
 	
 		well there's very few that you know my life would stop if i didn't catch
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		now i do before i go to work i tape my soap opera
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i watch one and
 	
 	
 		well i watch two but one's a half hour and one's an hour and and they lead into each other
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that's The Bold and the Beautiful and As the World Turns
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and i've watched the As the World Turns
 		since i was a little girl
 	
 	
 		yeah that's been on for years
 	
 	
 		so it's just you know it's it's something i've done for the last probably twenty five years
 	
 	
 		oh and so you get to come home
 		and watch them
 	
 	
 		yes and i don't have anyone else at home so i have freedom to watch whatever i want
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i like i like every i like the uh
 		the information shows and i like the comedies and you know and i i do like good movies i prescribed subscribe to H B O
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well we
 	
 	
 		so i can get some of the movies
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a good idea we did have H B O but it we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious you know it's just
 	
 	
 		it is
 		but i don't sleep a whole lot and i you know at two o'clock in the morning there isn't anything on regular TV and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh  so that's and
 	
 	
 		oh yes if you're up then
 	
 	
 		you don't get good reception without cable and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's primarily why i have it right now
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i i thought when i got my V C R i'd probably drop it you know but that was years
