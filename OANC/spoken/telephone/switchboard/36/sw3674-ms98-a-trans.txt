 		i'm a teacher and so when i read for pleasure i read strictly for escape
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i like you know i like books that are pretty high adventure and just real simple easy reading what about you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um i prefer my favorite types of books are um human interest type books biographies
 		um it can be fiction about people i like books that are about people that have historical you know that tell you something about the history at the same time you know or a certain area so
 	
 	
 		oh that's good that's good what book have you read that you really like
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		do you like about recent people or people in history

 		by Corrie Ten Boom yeah
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a wonderful book that's funny you should mention that one
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i like um i guess my preference is for Christian biographies but i i'm interested in both you know because i you learn a lot from reading about people's lives and
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		um
 		so
 		yeah that's probably one of my all time favorites what what would you say is your favorite book that you've ever read
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know with all the hip and hype i still love Gone with the Wind i haven't gotten a copy of Scarlett yet but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm sure i won't love it as much as Gone with the Wind but that's that's just a real masterpiece  um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess that really is my favorite book
 	
 	
 		yeah are you uh-huh
 		uh-huh i remember a long time ago i read some books by Glen Bristol you ever read any
 	
 	
 		no i never have
 	
 	
 		yeah those um
 		i don't know why Gone with the Wind made me think of that but those are books that are um like they some of them took place in
 		well there's one that took place in Georgia and another that took place California yeah they're historically based fiction so they're
 	
 	
 		are they historically based
 		uh-huh i like historically based fiction
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		when um
 		oh all those books by John Jakes came out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i i don't think i am i don't think i am but go ahead yeah
 	
 	
 		are you familiar with what i'm talking about there were like huh
 		oh it started with The Bastard and then it when it came over to the United States and took us through the Revolutionary War and the Civil War i've forgotten what all of them were
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they were right around the Centennial year though um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they were really
 		you know i really i i got into them and read i guess probably four or five of them and then i got burned out and said oh i think i'm tired of this group i like ones that are families
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like you read one and then you read about the next generation and the following generation
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah i'm
 	
 	
 		i think they also asked do you ever read books for self improvement
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right i do sometimes but um
 		they have to have illustrations or else i i get bored with them
 	
 	
 		what do you mean by illustrations
 	
 	
 		for for the most part i mean illustrations real examples you know instead of just giving me a sermon or giving me a you know how to type idea
 	
 	
 		right right
 		do you know what i hate i hate to read books by people like How to Raise Children and they're single
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah see they have to have some real
 	
 	
 		you know  dealing with your teenager and they're never around kids you know right
 	
 	
 		yeah some real examples from their own life that proves that they know what they're talking about i just read one called uh The Language of Love
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		by Gary Smalley and someone else and that was really good yeah it's full of personal illustrations and illustrations of people they'd work with their um psychologists
 	
 	
 		was it good
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so what about you what do you like to read for self-improvement
 	
 	
 		i don't know i  i really
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i get i i like i would rather read a book that's like for inspiration than a real self help book i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i don't get off on them just a whole lot i get bored real fast
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess i agree there
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when i when my kids were younger i used to read books on how to raise kids and had nothing they said worked so i  i said enough of that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
