 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what kind of dining out do you enjoy
 	
 	
 		well we usually do things that have to do with families because i have a family of four so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh four children or
 	
 	
 		four children yeah six of us altogether so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when we go out it's usually someplace that caters to children  more so than adult
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so that has a children's menu or uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		um well i don't have any children um and i'm a newlywed
 		so right now i guess my favorite type of restaurant is is a place that's fairly quiet and has a pleasant atmosphere
 		i sort of like the either an old country look or something um dim lights or something just you know the
 	
 	
 		have you found one in Dallas that you like
 	
 	
 		um well i enjoy Steak and Ale yeah that's that seems to have a pretty nice atmosphere usually not i don't like noise i just hate it when restaurants are like Bennigan's and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		they just opened up an Olive Garden here in Plano
 	
 	
 		that's the other one that i really like yeah i haven't the in Plano i haven't um oh yeah
 	
 	
 		do you like it there
 		i'm sure they're probably the same all over i've heard that their bread sticks are terrific
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i've been to one here in Dallas
 		yeah they are they really are i've only been there once uh but almost a year ago and i wanna go back i'd thought about it ever since it's not on our side of town
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah we've been meaning to try this one out here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you guys like what kind of food do you like
 	
 	
 		um  well my husband loves anything beef so he likes steak or ribs or something but i kind of like more variety i like to be able to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		me too when i go out i like to have things that i don't cook at home you know when just he and i go out then it
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's almost always fish or something that i don't wanna do at home
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i like to have a choice of fish or chicken and Italian food Mexican food
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know something
 		um
 		yeah something that i wouldn't
 		that takes more time to cook at home
 	
 	
 		yeah what um what makes you go back there
 	
 	
 		um i'd say well one thing is the price i don't like it
 	
 	
 		yeah i was gonna say price is probably my biggest concern
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah if it's overpriced or you know i mean if it's i like to still be able to get a meal for well i'd prefer five dollars or less they that's unusual these days if you go out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it seems like you can get the same menu for lunch cheap have you ever tried that just going for lunch and then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  yeah yeah we like uh Tony Roma's it's a rib place
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i've heard of that where is it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well um let's see there's there's one up at um see what is it just as um loop twelve turns into thirty five it merges it's right there it's sort of a restaurant row in Dallas there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then there's also one down at the Marketplace West End Marketplace
 		and we found out one day by mistake that lunch is about half as much as dinner is and you get about almost the same amount
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		in almost any restaurant that's almost the case that we've seen
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		so i'd say that's the first thing i look for is price and then atmosphere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah how about you
 	
 	
 		probably price would be first
 		um we're not  you know we seems like we're always rushing rushing around doing something so location that would have a lot to do with it too i mean we don't really travel to Mesquite or you know somewhere that takes half an hour to get there so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we've you know tried most of the places around here and that's kind of where we stay
 	
 	
 		yeah so so what would your favorite place be or one of your favorites
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		or some of your favorites
 	
 	
 		have you tried um The Louisiana Purchase do they have any of those over there
 	
 	
 		no i've never heard of that
 	
 	
 		those are good and it's kind of Cajun i usually don't like spicy food but that's real good especially lunch you know because for the same reason because it's got some atmosphere and yet the price is is good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my husband really likes Chinese food so we go Chinese just a little mom and pop kind of places
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		more so than the bigger
 	
 	
 		yeah i like Chinese too
 		yeah and sometimes you can uh you can often get that at a good price
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and some of them have good atmosphere too so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		Chinese places  doesn't seem like they really cater to atmosphere  the ones around here anyways just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah some of them don't
 	
 	
 		just authentic that's all it you know it says authentic on the outside
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		so do you like places that are noisy that are lively  yeah
 	
 	
 		no not necessarily
 		um when i go out with my husband i just want to be able to to talk to him so that doesn't lend itself to that and when i'm with my children
 		the more noise there is the more nose noise they think they can make  so it doesn't it tends to make them wilder so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		yeah i'm sure it does
 	
 	
 		i really like the Black-Eyed Pea but i also think that's real noisy have you ever been to a Black-Eyed Pea
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i have
 	
 	
 		it's got such a open atmosphere and clanking and banging that i love the food but it is really noisy
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's what i found too
 		so
 		well
 		do you have anything else you wanted to say
 	
 	
 		no i think that's pretty much what makes me go back
