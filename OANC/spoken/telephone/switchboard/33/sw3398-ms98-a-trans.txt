 		hi my name is uh Donna Donahue and i live in Plano Texas
 	
 	
 		hi
 		
 
 		hi my name is Lowell and i live in Raleigh North Carolina
 	
 	
 		oh okay um do you wanna start or would should i start
 	
 	
 		go right ahead
 	
 	
 		okay um i would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in
 		we have um three children and um they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball and
 		well my little girl goes to tap dance and my little one goes to preschool and um
 		i'm
 		home with the children just do a lot of running around it seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type
 		i don't know life um what about you
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm single and i i live in a town home here in Raleigh and it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area there we we have a lot of town homes here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		as well as single family homes and at the time that i bought this one it was just a a much better
 		arrangement for me personally i'm not home a lot i travel a great deal with my job and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it was easier to have a home that didn't exactly that somebody else looks out for the maintenance
 	
 	
 		was sort of maintenance free yeah
 		oh yeah well um that that sounds that sounds pretty good because i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to um maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds and
 		it's a lot of work owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it it's
 	
 	
 		it certainly is
 	
 	
 		sometimes i think um it would be nice to have a town home with not having all that responsibility
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well if you ever get one be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear i that's the main thing when i was shopping for one i wanna make sure i couldn't
 		it i couldn't here my neighbors and it was so i bought one that's more like living in a once you're inside you don't know you're in a town home
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh that sounds lovely
 	
 	
 		it is they're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of right side by side so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum so in in your area then there's probably a lot of um career type people that have those type homes and uh-huh and um
 	
 	
 		yes definitely
 	
 	
 		the area that we're settled in is um definitely young young families with with kids they're still doing um a lot of building in the neighborhood
 		so the people that move here seem to move from all over the country which we're from um the Northeast and um
 		seems like a lot of people just don't also also don't have any family around so it um also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors and you know um but um
 		that's i
 	
 	
 		well we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		people who don't wanna the heat of Florida but don't want the heat of the northeast the cold of the northeast so they settle sort of in between
 	
 	
 		right right
 		um-hum now it's um is it very very wooded around where you are there lots of pretty trees and yeah
 	
 	
 		yes as a matter of fact this is a uh
 		this particular community that i live in is very wooded
 	
 	
 		oh how pretty
 	
 	
 		it is nice it
 	
 	
 		i do miss that um around here in Plano there are very few trees and it's pretty flat and and kind of barren and
 		that's the only thing that we don't like about living in Texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall and and um
 		uh  the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is you know in the North um or even where you are
 	
 	
 		uh we definitely have a lot of trees here
 	
 	
 		a lot of leaves to rake up too i bet
 	
 	
 		yes but fortunately the home owner's association does all that yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		does that well see that's another plus
 	
 	
 		yes i don't have to worry about that and this is the time of year we're starting the leaves are all falling now
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right they are i'm gonna get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but
 		not not much just just a little kind of just in more of a makes a little bit of a mess for a few weeks then if you didn't do anything about it then they'd probably the leaves would just blow away so it's not too bad
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		okay do we have to speak for a certain amount of time okay okay well it was really nice speaking to you
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so
 		it was good to speak with you too
 	
 	
 		okay and have a happy Thanksgiving
 	
 	
 		thank you you too bye bye
 	
 	
 		bye bye
