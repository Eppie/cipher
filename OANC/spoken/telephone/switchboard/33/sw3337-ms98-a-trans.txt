 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh
 		what what is it what does camping mean to you and and
 		what camping have you done
 	
 	
 		oh we've done a lot of camping actually that's one of our favorite pastimes um  to us camping is is a combination of tent camping as well as environmental camping
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um and i think that really what it means to me is being outdoors in a sort of a wilderness environment and being able to enjoy nature
 		what does it mean to you
 	
 	
 		well what uh uh what what do you mean by environmental camping
 	
 	
 		um there are a number of environmental cabins near where we live that uh offer some sort of dwelling some sort of um security from the elements but there's no electricity no heat no water
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay
 		but yeah that's neat i'm not not
 		not had that available uh anywhere that i've lived at well uh first
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		State Park System i think is probably what supports a lot of those they're they're state as opposed to county facilities
 	
 	
 		what what state is that
 	
 	
 		California
 	
 	
 		California okay i'm in Texas and uh uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but most of the camping that we've done we we spent uh ten years in New England uh and my wife and i did a lot of tent camping before uh our first
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh boy was born uh there in in uh state parks in uh New England and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		here here in Texas there are are state parks where they have uh uh
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		shelters they're called uh they're wood frame on a concrete slab but screened in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kinds of of shelters and uh but they have uh electricity and uh water at those cabins and there there's  cabins
 	
 	
 		i see
 		actually in the cabins so it's like uh a a sink
 	
 	
 		well that's the no the uh there's uh
 		one outlet and a light in the cabin uh an overhead one overhead bulb and then just outside the cabin there's a uh
 		faucet uh coming up out of the pipe coming up out of the ground so that there's access to water like that uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		in in Texas what are the camp parks like if you go tent camping are you near a real wooded area or does it tend to be more um plains
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		no it's it's the the ones that i'm familiar with are are basically
 		uh basically wooded areas uh Texas has an awful lot of uh man made lakes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh uh tend to be uh wooded areas around those lakes i'm in i'm in Dallas northeast uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh what a difference from New England though i bet
 	
 	
 		yes yes oh yeah yes yes there there you could uh you know depending on what kind of camping you wanted why uh you go an hour in a different direction here you go
 		three hours in any direction and it's still about the same so uh that's a difference but we also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well what's it like camping with your son when he was young
 	
 	
 		well well we didn't we took a break from camping uh for with the the uh boys until they uh they got into uh scouts basically and uh and then our biggest one we we rented a uh pop up tent trailer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh several years ago and went up to uh the Black Hills and back down through the uh uh Colorado uh Rocky Mountain National uh Park and uh
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		that's a pretty area
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Colorado Springs area and so forth Pikes Peak and that was a that was a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i bet it was for them too it's been an experience uh with our daughter who's turning two in a couple of days because she was probably six months old the first time and we had kind of missed camping
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		well i the last time we'd camped before she was born i think i was eight months pregnant because we like stretched to the very end  and that was a little rough in a tent but uh she's actually done very well and has enjoyed it a lot even even as a little
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		little kid so it's been kind of fun uh trying to adjust our routine and and doing it with with her as she grows up
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and
 	
 	
 		i'm sure it'll be a lot different when she has a chance to really participate more
 	
 	
 		right right at at at at at two she's old enough to walk but not too far i would guess and and
 	
 	
 		which is what your kids have done
 		right and she's fairly cautious so we're not too concerned about her running into the poison ivy or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah well  right right but you also don't do a lot of of hiking associated with the camping i i presume yeah yeah well that that sounds good sounds good
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		uh staying close to the camp ground
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		well it sounds like you've um continued it no matter where you've been and how your family's grown so  that's my aspiration as well
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and   uh uh and and uh
 		although it it after a while it gets uh with teenage boys at this point well one's uh in college but uh uh
 	
 	
 		oh wow cool
 	
 	
 		uh it it turns different in that uh the problem becomes one of getting getting time when they're available and don't have other activities uh
 	
 	
 		right right well i guess it
