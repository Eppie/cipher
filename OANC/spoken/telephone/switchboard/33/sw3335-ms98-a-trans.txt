 
     		
 	
 		yeah i had this topic uh the last time i called i believe
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my goodness that's unusual
 	
 	
 		well do you have any uh children or are you in college
 	
 	
 		mine uh well mine are grown and uh of course uh i've already been through this with them
 	
 	
 		i see well
 	
 	
 		and i guess i'll have to help with grandchildren one of these days i hope
 	
 	
 		certainly and where did your uh children go to college
 	
 	
 		well one went to A and M and one went to um  uh oh Stephen F Austin and one went to North Texas and one went to University of Texas at Dallas
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		and one of them ended up at El Centro in one of the uh specialized programs and another is putting herself through right now back at UTD
 	
 	
 		i see
 		well that's great i'm the director of admissions at UTD
 	
 	
 		oh well good well i'm glad you let her in
 	
 	
 		well what advice did you give them when they were choosing their colleges it looks like they uh you have a variety there
 	
 	
 		well the main thing was uh what is it you want to study  and uh where is the best place to get what you need and
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		how far is it from home i had to put in and and then course we also had to include how much is it gonna cost
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you're going right down my list uh the first thing that i always talk to students about is the academic program because if we don't have what you're looking for it isn't gonna do you any good no matter how bad you wanna come here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh cost is always uh usually next on the list especially for the parents and uh financial assistance and scholarships
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and usually then we talk a little bit about uh the size of the school and uh different types of organizations and activities that they can get involved in and of course distance from home and size of classes and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um it sounds like uh from your experience you know how to go right down the list with them
 	
 	
 		well you have to be practical because uh i know um our our first daughter went uh to Stephen F Austin
 		and uh her allergies acted up in the Piney Woods and it was too far from home and she got lonesome and that didn't work out for her so i guess i learned on that one
 	
 	
 		yeah you you know it's interesting especially when uh uh my experience uh has always been at a public university
 		and uh a lot of the students in that home town uh sometimes shun the idea of staying and going to school across the street so to speak
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh it always seems like at the beginning of the year they're talking about well i'm going to this state and i'm getting out of here and i'm going way over there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a lot of times when it gets right down to the practical aspect of it they end up staying pretty darn close to home because they can save money as far as housing and uh laundry
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		laundry and food i think food has a lot to do with it too
 	
 	
 		you bet  it sure does
 	
 	
 		and mother doing the laundry  especially with the boys the girls it don't seem the laundry isn't that quite that important because they seem to know how to handle that better but the boys it's that laundry that throws them there for a while
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		even when they know how to use the washing machine
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well there's a little barrier around the washing machine and the dryer and uh for some reason men just can't get around that barrier
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well we'll have to give them the pass key i guess do you have uh uh more than the one daughter to plan for
 	
 	
 		uh i have a daughter that's a seventh grader and then i have a son that's a sophomore at uh Shepton High School
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and so it's uh it's been interesting watching them uh sign up for appropriate course work and things and they're they're on the college bound track at least
 	
 	
 		um-hum well
 		that's good do you find that uh the boy is going in a different direction than the girl as far as what his uh um needs are and the type of college he wants
 	
 	
 		well uh they certainly have two different personalities but uh in terms of needs the older son is interested in the medical field
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 		good
 	
 	
 		and uh at this particular point you know taking appropriate course work but really nothing uh that's in out of the ordinary
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh the daughter has indicated that uh she wants to get a degree in uh
 		business um and then go on to become President  sure  you bet and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay i'll vote for her if she has good track record hope i'm around to do so
 	
 	
 		well i uh you know we're we we try to be conscious of uh of the uh equal uh equal rights and uh
