 
     		
 	
 		okay what kind of car are you gonna buy next
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well one of the cars i'm thinking about buying next is uh a nice safe small car but um
 		uh the reason being is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family and we use that to get back and forth and to haul kids around and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so forth and we have another four door car that i drive to work and i think it'd be more economical if i were able to get a smaller car and uh wouldn't be wouldn't cost much with gas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's true
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		what what are you looking at
 	
 	
 		well i'm really not looking at anything for a while but you know when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out and you think oh well maybe maybe i would like a new car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but i think i'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway but uh
 	
 	
 		oh yes oh yes well the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the
 	
 	
 		right they are i sure do like the looks of that new Mitsubishi Mitsubishi Diamante
 	
 	
 		when you
 		oh yes oh yes
 	
 	
 		that is a pretty car
 	
 	
 		and
 		i'm uh i really like the looks also of the new Mazda
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's pretty too
 	
 	
 		that they have but um
 		i uh
 		you know the the cost of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now
 	
 	
 		yeah they get pretty expensive
 	
 	
 		yes they do
 	
 	
 		the last one i bought i bought a uh
 		well it's a it's a Town Car but it was a demo returned
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i got it with like you know i think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars off less than what the list price was
 	
 	
 		right
 		well you can't go wrong with that kind of a opportunity
 	
 	
 		so i was really pleased to find that and i then i bought it for cheaper i was looking at a Honda Accord a brand new one and i bought this uh the the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what i was gonna buy the new Honda Accord
 	
 	
 		yes
 		wow well you get a much bigger better comfortable ride
 	
 	
 		and the thing about it is they give you that ten uh that that hundred thousand mile mile five year warranty where it only costs you twenty five dollars to have anything repaired
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		well that's fantastic that's real real good
 	
 	
 		so uh i have really been impressed i said i'll probably never be able to find another one that i can afford you know but i have loved this car better than anything i've ever driven because you you can go on the road and get there and you're not even tired
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no do you
 		a very comfortable smooth ride huh
 	
 	
 		and it gets like twenty six miles to the gallon on the road
 	
 	
 		oh it does that's that's unbelievable for that size of a cars
 	
 	
 		it sure does
 		i had they kept telling me that and i thought they're crazy so the week after i got it well actually before i signed the papers on it i took it over to Boozier City and it did it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		wow that's great that's great that kind of gas mileage uh we're we're kind of hoping for on our van
 	
 	
 		but it uh
 		yeah well that's kind of what we've always been told you know they'll do it and then we hope for it and it never happens but it really it does get good gas mileage
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that's excellent did
 	
 	
 		most of the time when i don't go anywhere i can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work you know and then fill it up so
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you uh do you does it uh need a lot of repairs is it very reliable kind of car
 	
 	
 		i haven't had anything i've taken it in twice for like
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		just really minor things and it cost me the twenty five dollars the uh really really something really silly when we first got it we couldn't get the light
 		they have all these lights in the car and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the backseat and we couldn't get the light to turn off
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and we kept kept trying you know and we went out to dinner with some friends and it stayed on all night you know just shining right down on them you know
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		and we couldn't get it to turn off and the next day my husband goes out there and he tries to get it off we turn the knob you know in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off and we turned everything we could and he took it in and
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		they said you know you just have to press the switch he says i've pressed every switch in that car and i can't get the light off it's broken so they took it in and charged us the twenty five dollars and they called and told us though that all you have to do is turn the off switch and they showed us where the switch was
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		they charged you twenty five dollars just to tell you that huh
 	
 	
 		they they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch but he hadn't he hadn't done the right one and it's right on the arm rest in the back and we didn't know it was there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh so they probably went through the
 		i see
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car
 	
 	
 		and found it right away huh
 	
 	
 		and so we thought you know there  it was broken
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but we've had just uh i guess it's been in two times i've had it three years now
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh it's been in two maybe three times but it's just been real minor things
 	
 	
 		well i think that uh you have an excellent deal then and the the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right but it's really it's been an enjoyable car like i say i'll probably never be able to have another one because i think we bought it for about sixteen thousand you know and i said i'll never find another one for that price
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 		no  not at all
 	
 	
 		and they keep going up so i'll have to enjoy it
