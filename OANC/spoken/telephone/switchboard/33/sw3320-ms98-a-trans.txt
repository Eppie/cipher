 
     		
 	
 		we're supposed to talk about crime in the city
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh  seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesn't it
 	
 	
 		well uh i uh that's sure um
 		i think i think it's statistics statistics obviously vary greatly i always thought of Dallas as being a fairly safe place
 	
 	
 		well it is but our crimes up here uh is i think it must be in most cities now
 		but i was listening to the news the other day and they said they thought a lot of it the reason it was up so was because of the uh so many people are without work nowadays
 		economy's so bad
 	
 	
 		do you really believe that i mean it it's been up every year for many years and the economy hasn't been this bad for so long has it
 	
 	
 		well that's a good point   that's just what they quoted over the news
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know if i'll believe that or not but it it does seem up and uh
 	
 	
 		what kind of newspaper do you get down there
 	
 	
 		what kind
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well we got a i think we got a pretty good newspaper uh we have two the Morning News and the uh Times Herald
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Morning News seems to have the largest circulation i think it's a pretty good it's a locally owned paper the Herald is owned i think by the Times out of uh LA or somewhere
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes do do they do they play up the local crime angles or do or do they
 	
 	
 		but
 		well they don't no not really uh they don't play it up i don't think uh
 		but there there is too much of it you know uh too many homes broken into we had our our fact about uh last year sometime our home was broken into
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		really so this is a topic of personal interest
 	
 	
 		we
 		yeah we uh uh i didn't think ours ever would be burgled into burgled but so many in our neighborhood had been
 		and uh because we live on a corner and back up to a real uh highly traveled main
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		street but uh we were so uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so so you saw this happening in your neighborhood and you figured it wouldn't happen to you
 	
 	
 		sort of yeah and i never did get a security system but since that happened i certainly have
 	
 	
 		yeah what kind of system do you have
 	
 	
 		it's uh  uh  i guess excuse me just a standard uh
 		with the uh all the doors and uh
 		uh infrared thing you know motion detector pretty pretty standard
 	
 	
 		um-hum is
 		is this is this one with some company that that services you and takes your calls and all that stuff
 	
 	
 		yes yes it's monitored and all that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well is is that a necessary feature to have somebody you know at the other end of the line or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise
 	
 	
 		and
 		i think uh the thing that makes a lot of noise would would suffice i really do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh this deal that was part of it for you know
 		three years or so you pay the unit off or whatever
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		but it uh the monitoring's not that bad though because uh
 		uh we've goofed it up you know several times you'll hit the
 		wrong key not intentionally or something and  and they call back pretty quickly so i i guess it's you know i think it's all right but i to answer your question i think uh uh i think uh that is a pretty good deterrent in itself whether it
 	
 	
 		um hum
 		yeah
 		so so so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system and what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly that uh if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		supposedly who knows you know
 	
 	
 		how does it do that
 	
 	
 		but that's the selling point and i think they're probably i think it probably does these things are
 		supposedly supposedly pretty good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		boy they sure advertise them you know so many of them nowadays
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		but uh well don't y'all don't y'all have a pretty high crime rate up there
 	
 	
 		well yeah um
 	
 	
 		i'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's down here we seem to or or not here but the statistics seem to say that i don't know
 	
 	
 		i i think it's the murder capital of the country now
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i would gather probably from drugs
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		and i think that's the reason it's so high everywhere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't think there's anyplace  used to years ago you thought well these little small cities and all  wouldn't have that problem but they do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it uh as anyone you know
 	
 	
 		so so so what's the solution
 	
 	
 		that's a good question i don't know i don't know what the solution is i really don't
 	
 	
 		and all these politicians make make hay over you know being anticrime but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep
 	
 	
 		they haven't seemed to have changed anything
 	
 	
 		the and nothing seems to change and uh i'm not sure that anything will because these  if something could happen to make these people not wanna buy it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but they wanna buy it so supplying and demand long as somebody wants to buy it somebody's gonna provide it for them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't know i don't  you know i don't know what the solution is i really don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't think anyone does in fact
 	
 	
 		and what
