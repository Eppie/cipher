 		um
 	
 	
 		All My Children i've watched that for about twelve years
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i'm sure i watched it for more than that probably twenty some i used to uh General Hospital when i was a teenager doesn't
 	
 	
 		i quit watching General Hospital when Leslie got killed
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so that was a long time ago i used to watch it  when in high school and college and and when Laura's mother got killed that she was my favorite character on there i
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just  i read the reason she got she they they killed her off was because they couldn't settle the contract and i said well if they're gonna do that to her i won't watch it and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's great well i do like All My Children and i and i like it you know i don't know i just i like the people on it i guess you know
 	
 	
 		i i i i like it i just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back
 	
 	
 		yeah well Tad's gonna come back i bet do you think
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm sure he will
 	
 	
 		he'll be he'll come back show up at the just the right moment
 	
 	
 		i kind of wish that uh Nina would come back because she because the story you you know just for a brief visit or whatever because it never has been resolved with Palmer remarrying and and everything
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah like Daisy pops in once in a while and
 		i forgot about Nina and Cliff right

 		that's how they left the show but not in real life
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		now she's married to some guy in New York and she's happily married and that's the reason she left the show i guess she wanted a private life
 	
 	
 		oh okay oh see i i i watch it maybe twice a month so i don't watch it everyday like i did when i had babies
 	
 	
 		oh well i'll i i'll watch
