 
     		
 	
 		okay my children are all grown up
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh okay well no see i've got two children and uh they're one's uh just turned to be a teenager and the other one is on his way so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i uh i'm a single parent so i think it makes it more difficult for me to um you know find time with my my children since i work and then of course take care of the house and and all this good kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		i'll bet
 	
 	
 		um so it's a real uh it's a real problem for me
 	
 	
 		i'll bet it is what is the favorite thing you do with your children
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um the the thing that we like to do the most is to watch TV together and uh the kids like to play Nintendo but i'm no good at it so i don't like to play that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you just watch them play huh
 		i i've tried it once or twice but i didn't feel like i was very good at it either my grandson got me to one day but
 	
 	
 		me either
 		yeah they talk about these different levels and stuff and i've never got off of level one  yes  yeah
 	
 	
 		different worlds and how do you get to another world you know and i i don't even know where they're talking about
 	
 	
 		uh i know i i agree with you so uh but no the other thing i think we like to go to the movies too that's the yeah that's a that's a neat thing so i guess we're all in um you know movie uh fanatics or whatever around here so we like to do those kind of things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you
 		yeah i know when our kids were growing up our we were big into water sports we had a boat and they all skied and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they always took other friends with them and we had a lot of fun doing that but i had all girls so we didn't do too much sportswise
 	
 	
 		oh how neat uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball and little boys do all of those things but
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		oh yeah oh yeah see i have a son and uh you know it's football in the fall and and baseball in the spring and and it's one activity after another i i'm constantly going back and forth and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i'll bet you really are
 	
 	
 		yeah uh my daughter has uh tennis so it's between tennis and and bowling my i bowl so you know we're pretty active as a sports you know in in the family so it's it's really neat
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum well when mine were real little they all played soccer but
 		you know that was just for a couple of years when they were pretty small for girls and then they got more interested in other things  i'm not sure that they would admit it at that age that it was boys but i think that's probably what it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		boys
 		oh yeah i i know that uh my daughter uh even though she goes out with the the sports and everything uh yeah she likes to watch the football for uh the kids  oh i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		uh-oh that was a cat that hit the telephone get away cat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		gosh  i guess it's why they wanted to do on this type telephone because there's all kind of activity that goes on  but uh yeah my uh my kids are they're starting to grow up you know it's not gonna be too many more years before i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh you know they'll be gone and and uh there won't be as many activities do you uh
 	
 	
 		but they but you enjoy them i think the older mine get the more i enjoy them
 	
 	
 		yeah i i agree with you i i do i'm so glad they're out of the that young real young age and the babies
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i mean i didn't i it wasn't that i didn't like them when they were little but the older they got i enjoyed them as teenagers
 	
 	
 		right
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		and now that they're each  of course three girls they're each becoming they're they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		how what kind of mothers they are what kind of wives you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah that's so that's so true well do you do the do your daughters live close where you can go out and
 	
 	
 		how they do things and
 		two of them live real close to me so we we spend a lot most of our time spent with them is they come over to eat
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and bring the kids and we play with the kids you know but uh we don't oh we go camp out they camp out and we spend weekends at the in the country with them quite a bit but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh uh
 	
 	
 		as far as doing any activity now that the grand kids are here we all just stay around the house mostly  it's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well that's true
 		oh yes oh yes well i know especially when they grow up like that so i'm trying these these last five or six years i'm trying to make them really special and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh very precious since that's uh about the only time we've got left
 	
 	
 		they'll always remember it too
 	
 	
 		yes yes absolutely i I think so too
 	
 	
 		i hear mine saying well i remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so i need to take my boys to do this or that you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i remember the year we went to Disney World as quick as my kids are big enough we're gonna go to Disney World you know
 	
 	
 		there we go i know i know they can't wait
 	
 	
 		yeah they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun but
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right yeah so well i still got a few more years so i'm uh i'm hanging onto those and doing as much activity as i can with them
 	
 	
 		do you work
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh i sure do and uh work full time so uh it it that cuts into our free time right there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it really does the time you have with them has to be quality time then
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right and uh vacations are very special for us and activities
 	
 	
 		i imagine that they have uh some a lot of homework too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you know this being a school night and stuff so uh it's it's in the same old you you know routine of uh you know doing homework and you know trying to talk between all of that and and uh the other activities that we all have
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		well there's just so many things to do with them nowadays so and especially if they're active kids like you say you bowl
 	
 	
 		um-hum
