 
     		
 	
 		so how do you keep up on current events
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well i  take the  a daily paper i take the Houston Chronicle and uh
 		when i my ritual in the morning is get my cup of coffee and the paper and
 		sit down and  check the headlines and at the same time i've got uh CNN on TV  so uh that's sort of how i start the day is uh finding out
 		what's going on and then uh in my business i'm in the oil business and we keep a a television tuned to CNN all day long and uh at a very at a real low volume uh that started back whenever we had the the
 		war and uh the oil market was very volatile
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's something that we just  you know we've we've stayed with and we've all kind of got accustomed to it and whenever there's anything exciting happening well we're we've got the access to it right away
 	
 	
 		that's right your usually probably probably more adept at more adept adept at the news uh than most people i would assume i uh
 		i don't quite have as the as regimented of a ritual as you do i get up in the morning if i don't have to go to work
 		and i'll grab the paper i'll usually pull out the sports section and the business section and try to read those two first and then after i get through those
 		i'll turn to the front
 		front page news and and uh if an article catches my my my eye i'll i'll read it
 		otherwise i'll just flip through the paper and you know like i said if if nothing really sounds interesting i'll just skip over it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i i'm i'll have to admit now  Monday through Friday my newspaper reading is pretty much uh hit the high points and let it go but
 		on Sundays i really i really dig into it i'm i'm a pretty voracious uh
 		Sunday paper reader that's a a big part of my uh  Sundays relax with the Sunday paper and coffee and breakfast and just go completely through it but um
 	
 	
 		do you do you guys have a pretty uh pretty thick paper there in in Houston on Sundays
 	
 	
 		yeah the uh the Chronicle is it's you know it's similar to uh i guess the Dallas Morning News
 	
 	
 		okay that's that's a good that's a good sized paper
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		there's there's a couple hours project right there
 	
 	
 		yeah but it it's always kind of i mean and it is something i take a lot of pleasure in i i thoroughly enjoy it
 		but it's always amazed me uh  i don't know i've got a my brother in in Austin for instance  that i mean he never looks at the paper he's not interested you know and it's just it's kind of astounding to me i'm i subscribed to Time magazine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh i guess for  five or six years nonstop you know and and it was a good source for a lot of information but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then i moved and  didn't renew my subscription and now i don't i kind of got out of the habit of that but um i'm i'm interested in what's going on in the world and like to stay as
 		you know as as as current as i as one can um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i know uh
 		oh i generally work pretty late and consequently i'm not able to uh catch the the evening news but if i on on on the occasions that i do get in early enough i like to watch the ABC evening news i like uh  uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh Peter Jennings yeah a lot better than any of the other uh announcers
 	
 	
 		was that Peter Jennings yeah
 		okay i uh  admittedly don't really tune myself into the
 		into either the five thirty the local news or the six o'clock news i uh
 		it usually ends up being a repeat of  what was in the morning paper or else if it's early enough it'll be in the next day's paper and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the local news is is
 		to me it isn't that interesting because it's
 		generally not too much human interest stuff it's more the you know somebody died here or we had a fire here
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and uh  i don't know i i when i was growing up i used to watch it all the time and maybe that was because i i grew up in a small town
 		where the local news meant something to me because i could relate to the area or to the town or to the people but you know in in when you have a a Dallas Fort Worth market
 		i really don't care what happened in Fort Worth or Arlington for that matter
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah well it interesting that it that you know you mention a small town i have a friend of mine who um she's a school teacher
 		and  this year um moved into a to a
 		pretty small town i mean we're talking about maybe sixteen thousand people or so and is teaching school there she really does she loves her
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		her work and she likes living there she said the part of it that drives her crazy is is she's accustomed to living in a city and having a big newspaper and she said you know it's the little things
