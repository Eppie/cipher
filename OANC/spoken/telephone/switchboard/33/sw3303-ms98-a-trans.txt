 
     		
 	
 		okay you wanna go ahead and tell me your favorite team or who you think will be doing well this year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well where i'm from the Atlantic coast conference is a very big conference and
 		course we have Duke University that was the national champions last year so i'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again this year they have a lot of the same players back
 	
 	
 		now we talking about is this the NBA this is college college okay
 	
 	
 		no this is college basketball right we have like Carolina and Duke and Georgia Tech and NC State
 		teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so hopefully we'll have a good year i don't really  follow the NBA very closely
 	
 	
 		and see that's probably all all i like saw while i we have moved in the last couple years from Utah to Texas and there's so many colleges and universities in Texas we haven't really
 		followed them too much and none of them are our our alma mater  so that seems to help
 	
 	
 		do you like professional basketball
 	
 	
 		uh  i've uh follow it especially around the play-offs so course i was real familiar with the Utah Jazz and
 		the Mailman or Karl Malone was you know pretty big thing and the Lakers have always been amazing to watch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no i i did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks they've
 		not had any good seasons for a long time and have a lot of problems with with Tarpley and maybe now that that's over they'll they'll come out of it but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's an up and coming team though
 	
 	
 		yeah i hope they do something they need to or they're not going to have any esteem left at all
 	
 	
 		that's somebody you can get behind and be patient
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah kind of like the Cowboys i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons
 	
 	
 		yeah they coming out of it this year we'll see if it holds on
 	
 	
 		but i think Chicago will probably win the NBA again
 	
 	
 		the Bulls
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah they'll probably be pretty good and course the Celtics they're always really  really good too with their players
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		be interesting to see how the the Olympics does this year with all the  the NBA players playing on the Olympic team
 	
 	
 		that's true it will be interesting and it'll certainly be different
 	
 	
 		so yeah i don't know how close i'll follow them and and the season hasn't started yet i'm usually more at the end of the season person and we need to talk about baseball  and so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah oh my Atlanta Braves
 	
 	
 		well they did well
 	
 	
 		well i really do uh yeah the basketball season supposed to start in the next couple of weeks  it's a long season
 	
 	
 		it's yeah yeah
 		it is it is and that's why i've i guess my mind went blank it's like last season was so long ago and i haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but this wasn't a good subject but but we'll see how our predictions come true
 	
 	
 		it's a little early
 		we definitely will
 	
 	
 		okay well it's good talking to you
 	
 	
 		good to talk to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		alrighty bye-bye
