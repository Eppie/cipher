 
     		
 	
 		um i guess i i've rented most of the time so i i haven't done much home repair uh i do small little little odd jobs
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i i live here at home with my parents and uh
 		not too long ago uh
 		we uh put in a a storage room out in the in the back part of our hall here we took took part of the garage and turned it into inside of the house
 		and walled it off and put cabinets and stuff in and
 		took  a good gee probably two months to do all of it working on weekends and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i i worked uh with a guy uh it was quite a few years ago uh
 		and um he built uh his own homes stuff like that and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i helped him quite a bit as from from everything from the carpentry work right electrical plumbing just about everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it was kind of fun to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah the i uh i worked construction on a a new American Airlines building out here for couple of weeks
 		hanging hanging six stories off a side of a building from scaffolding isn't my idea of fun
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no no no no that's uh
 	
 	
 		i prefer to keep my feet on the ground and  stuff like that  but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		no i had a have a job kind of
 		delves into uh construction a little bit where uh we worked on wooden railroad bridges
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh some of them uh in the country
 		uh get pretty high and and you're overlooking uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh a small body of water mostly rocks down there and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i can imagine that's uh
 	
 	
 		and you're just
 		yeah so uh it's not fun to work too high but uh you know the uh i think more what they're talking about is into the the homes and
 	
 	
 		yeah the the home improvement stuff
 	
 	
 		basically most of that i've  you know done some minor minor repairs electrically and minor repairs plumbing uh stuff like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my my dad and i are always having to fix light switches or put in new new uh outlets and stuff because you know mama wants another another outlet somewhere so we
 		go climbing around in the attic and dropping wire and cutting holes in the wall
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i i enjoy doing a lot of projects like that but not alone
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i i prefer having someone that uh has some knowledge in that and
 		and i uh help and learn and uh go that route but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if i had to tackle something you know building an addition totally by myself uh i wouldn't enjoy it at all
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it doing something like that you have to you have to plan it all out and make sure that you've got all your your measurements and calculations down before you ever even start to knock a hole in a wall or something you know
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		but uh we didn't i mean we that that room that we built we put they we built cabinets and stuff and made a little desk top and my mom put uh
 		uh some tile on the on the desk top so it's it's like a it's it's a  just a flat board that has tile on it
 	
 	
 		hm
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it she doesn't she doesn't ever go back and sit in it or write on it or anything i think she just did it for decoration
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well sounds like quite a project there
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it was sometimes fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i guess lot of times when uh i don't know
 		when you're pressed for time and have to do it and
 		wanna get it done then it doesn't become fun anymore
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think the the smaller projects tend to be more fun something you can finish in you know maybe a week or something but
 	
 	
 		yeah thing things that that that take a long time or you're doing them in the middle of the summer when it's hot is is not fun
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well uh especially uh stuff like roofing when you're doing it in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		ninety to a hundred degree weather and uh
 	
 	
 		and the sun's bouncing off the roof to start with and so yeah it's even hotter and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah for sure
 	
 	
 		working with uh the the black the black tar paper it that stuff gets really hot
 	
 	
 		yeah and then it almost seems like lot of that uh tile up there is is almost starting to melt in your hands
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's real hard to handle
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		well i don't know about you but i'm i'm about out uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i i think we're at a at a loss here
 	
 	
 		yeah so i think we'll just end it short
 	
 	
 		okay it was nice talking to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		yeah bye
