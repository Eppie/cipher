 		okay  uh do you want me to go first
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		okay if i was having a dinner party  i would probably um  have some um some uh um
 		some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and um probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some ah
 		ah salsa and chips around and peanuts and then i would have
 		um let's see i usually have like a little theme when i have a dinner party so um i would have maybe um say if it was like Greek night or something um maybe um  on the barbecue we'd put um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		cubes of lamb or i guess lamb used for Greek and um like a shish kebab and um mushrooms and tomatoes and onions and then we'd have um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar salad and um let's see what else um maybe some rolls and um i guess some um some rice or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		jeez well well when's the party here
 	
 	
 		how's that sound
 		yeah  um yeah that would take some planning  but
 	
 	
 		i don't know being a being the bachelor here that i am i i don't think i i'd be
 		nah nah it i mean it it's not a question of capability here to do something like that it's just there's there's no motivation
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know i wanna i wanna throw some charcoal on the grill and and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that but um
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds good too but i have um i have three kids so um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when we have friends over i have my oldest kind of babysit for the little two younger ones upstairs and um usually we just have very plain kind of you know interesting not very interesting meals pizza and that also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun but it's not a not a regular thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um now we supposed to talk for about five minutes is that it okay
 	
 	
 		yeah it
 		yeah that's what they they're shooting for here

 		well i live on a i live on a lake here and uh so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it it during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors like that's a little more ah casual thing but in mine in the wintertime it's not bad too because then i've got a
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		you know fireplace and a nice nice house and all that so it's uh uh really good place to do entertaining like that i just haven't uh really tried a whole lot but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh that sounds wonderful
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know let's see i have had well one time i did have a dinner party i served a uh  uh
