 
     		
 	
 		pets
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no as a matter of fact i do not have any pets
 	
 	
 		you don't
 	
 	
 		no i'm i uh travel quite a little bit with my work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and i love pets i mean you know i have friends who have cats and dogs and all that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but since i'm out of town so much i um am hesitant
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to get a pet because i don't you know i i feel that such i feel it's a responsibility
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and i would want to be a a good pet owner and i do have friends that uh
 		you know go off and leave their pets for what i think are just long periods of time and that seems so cruel to me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it is
 		you know i you know i'm home all the time or not all the time but um you know i'm home at night
 		and everything and i do have a Siamese
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		cat and we lived up in South Dakota and i got her there at the Humane Society
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		somebody had dropped her off
 		but um
 		she's got a crooked tail and the whole bit
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know it's so  so often the uh the animals that come from the pound are the best ones
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh she's great she's you know she's a character she'll sit with anybody she'll play with anybody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and she's you know a a great cat
 	
 	
 		well you know it's  it's funny i mean i i know i really i'd like to have a pet i'm single and i know that you know there's a great therapeutic value
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but like i say i'm i'm at this particular juncture in my life i i don't feel i would be a
 		you know a good uh uh parent if you will for a for a pet but i know my parents um had had uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		a pet for years and then they that dog died and they went for several years that they didn't have a pet and now they've got a German Shepherd that they are just nuts about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		and it's you know and it's great to see that because and you can just see that that you know it adds something to their lives
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's great my husband is gone a lot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so she's great to have around
 	
 	
 		good company
 	
 	
 		you know when i'm you know sitting here by myself and
 		and have somebody at least something in the house you know besides sitting here by myself
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		but that's a good thing i think when people are alone a lot
 	
 	
 		have you ever
 	
 	
 		then i think they're a great thing
 	
 	
 		have you ever thought of getting her a companion cat
 	
 	
 		no she's one that will not handle another cat
 	
 	
 		is that right very territorial huh
 	
 	
 		right um when they had her at at the Humane Society she was okay as long as she was by herself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but as long as soon as i what i'm thinking as what they're thinking is that she was in a
 		in an environment with a lot of cats
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and what their thing is she got the broken tail with from a cat fight
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and um it looks like well she was declawed and everything when they took her there and they just found her on the step
 		and uh they're thinking that she they couldn't handle her being with the other cats
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so they left her there and so i got her and you can tell when she's around other cats she'll pick a fight real fast
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but as long as she's by herself with us it's no problem she's really she's great with people
 	
 	
 		how old was she when you got her
 	
 	
 		one year old
 	
 	
 		yeah was that i mean that's one of the things i've often wondered about if you get an animal that
 		you know i i always think about the idea of getting them whenever they're very young so it's i kind of always kind of wonder how well they adjust or how long it takes them you know as an adult
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh she adjusted the that same day
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		yeah she was great you know she
 	
 	
 		she said this is home huh
 	
 	
 		yeah she says this is home she knew right where the bed was she laid on my pillow she you know did everything she laid on me on my stomach and you know went right to the cat litter box and where that was and she was great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's great
 		yeah
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		i think she was a good cat it's just that the other cats were a problem for her
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a friend who has a uh a cat that she got from the pound
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well actually i take that back she didn't get it from the pound she found it in her yard okay and you know and it was just the poor cat was just a mess it was the most horrible looking thing and of course her heart went out to it and she started feeding it and the next thing you know she had a cat
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 		um
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it turned into a beautiful animal long hair lot of hair and an odd markings and i think it you know is a Heinz Fifty seven variety but really a a handsome cat
 	
 	
 		oh great
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but the crazy thing about it is this cat has a severe allergy to fleas
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so she has to she she bathes the cat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and the cat with this special you know uh uh formula medicine that the vet gave her and which i had never heard of anyone bathing a cat but it you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		fairly regularly she bathes this cat and the cat you know is not  not particularly crazy about it but at the same time has kind of gotten used to it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and it sits really wild i couldn't i couldn't believe it whenever she was telling he well i got to you know bathe my cat
 	
 	
 		oh my mom has a Himalayan and she's grown up with ten kids in the house and she has no more kids and so this cat is just her baby
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's a Himalayan longhair you hear of that cat having beauty appointments
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hair appointments she goes gets her hair done and comes home with a bow and the whole ten yards and it's just great  my mom takes it she thinks this is great you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but she just you know she the cat just loves it She sits there and gets her hair blow dried and everything and
 	
 	
 		yeah they said this uh friend of mine in Dallas  started off with just a couple of cats
 	
 	
 		it's just funny
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now i think she's got three or four cats and a dog
 	
 	
 		oh real ly
