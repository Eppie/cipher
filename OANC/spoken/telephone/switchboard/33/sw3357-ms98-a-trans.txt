 
     		
 	
 		i guess we get started now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know i you know i've always  was interested in in woodworking i i watch a lot of the PBS stations where they have uh you know the woodworking
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh shows and that but i've never really done anything myself because i don't really have the tools for it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		but uh someday when i can get up uh enough of the tools i  i wanna try and make a lot of the stuff
 		uh i got books on it and everything and it shows you step by step on how to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i've never made made much myself i guess uh  do they count uh
 		uh let's see i guess tree houses and things like that don't count as woodworking woodworking do they
 	
 	
 		well i think anything from you know building a house uh to cabinetry would be woodworking i mean i i think that would be classified that you built a tree house  pretty good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		oh yeah you know  hold on a second  you can't pull up  hold on  you can't pull up on it it will disconnect
 		um yeah i've done tree houses and crafts you know craft type of things you know out of plywood and  things of that so i have a a few saws i mean a few a few tools
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that you need for that kind of stuff just not a
 		not like for uh book shelves well i can make bookshelves too i guess nothing like for cabinets or tables or things like that you know you have to have special some special things for that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah but
 		i mean i do household repairs i guess that counts as woodworking doesn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		you get skills in that and it helps you in almost anything you do so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's fine yeah i wanted a uh maybe i might try and uh even though i don't have too much tools but i don't think it takes too much to build a bookshelf i know i i need one so  maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no it doesn't take too much for that my dad does a lot of woodworking i mean he makes like furniture
 	
 	
 		yeah well it sounds like both our dads are good my dad made a a whole wall cabinet uh closet type thing uh
 		and all he did was he hired someone once to build it and then he watched him and  and he uh built it himself and he did
 	
 	
 		yeah now what did he make a a cabinet
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of a a a closet cabinet um
 		built on a whole wall took up the whole wall and it's got uh the for hanging up shirts and pants area and drawers and all sorts of things in there it's pretty pretty yeah pretty fancy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh takes up a whole wall
 		huh
 		yeah i've always wanted to make furniture and stuff but  the uh
 		the tools and uh you know after watching my dad do it but the tools have gotten me in uh
 		seems like it very time consuming i've never
 		never with all my kids i've never had much time for that for the time consuming things
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i know uh i know watching these programs with some of the fancy tools they have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it it makes it so easy that i think almost anyone one could do it if they could afford the probably four or five thousand dollars for each item they got uh it just about everything it does um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know different things for for different cuts and that and uh i think it would make it so much easier but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think that'd be more for the professional if you're gonna do it as a business uh those types of tools are fine
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah  well my dad doesn't do it as business and he's and he's got thousands of dollars worth of
 		we got disconnected  we talked for a pretty good while it was here it was on this end here
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah are we still
 		i'm still here hello
 		hello
 		hey what happened what what do they do when you're done do they just disconnect you yeah
 		well i just got disconnected
 		that's it you hang i think it's he's got a kid there it must've been
