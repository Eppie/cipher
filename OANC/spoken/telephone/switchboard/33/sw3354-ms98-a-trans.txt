 
     		
 	
 		okay well what do you do on your yard
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well ah typical lawn stuff Saint Augustine ah with a little Bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and really all i do to it is uh in fact i didn't even fertilize it this year i just mowed it and i i mow it uh you know with a mulch mower so the the particles fall down yeah
 	
 	
 		comes back in the yard so you don't have anyone do your yard you do it yourself yeah we do too
 	
 	
 		i do it myself  have a lot of people trying to do it for me but  hey i need the exercise so what the heck
 	
 	
 		isn't that the truth all flyer's on every door everyday that's right well we um we my husband does the same thing he does the yard and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower but i keep putting off learning
 	
 	
 		hey you've got the right idea
 	
 	
 		that's right but i had recently gone out and planted mums so we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago and so while my husband was painting i went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and put out yellow and bronze and they just gorgeous and so then last week my mom comes in town and she says well those are gonna die just the first frost
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she said you should have done pansies and i went well now you tell me  so that first night that on Halloween we went out and covered them with a sheet and they did okay that first night but the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it so i guess i've lost them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i haven't gone out to check yet
 	
 	
 		yeah i wouldn't don't blame you i wouldn't wanna look at them
 	
 	
 		oh listen but um the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here i guess it was about four years ago and we did not know in August to put down the uh whatever it is for grub worms
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the next spring i guess in that March every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed we'd have big whole patches come up have you ever seen it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		what grub worms do and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it it would just come off in the rake down to the dirt so we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares
 		and wet it and put it down and rope it off everything it took a lot of money and a lot of time so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazanon
 	
 	
 		yeah you you you think that's what it was uh mulch mulch mulch okay well
 	
 	
 		oh yeah we found them
 		yeah we found them we dug under there about an inch and you could see them they're real fat old white things and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah those kind of brown uh June what we call June bugs and some people call them May beetles and yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but in but in the whole um-hum
 		yeah June bugs is what i'd heard them called so anyhow occasionally i find them in the flower beds they said that every yard has some but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before
 	
 	
 		yeah well i had some of that problem but mine was freeze it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that too you know two years ago or last Christmas is that what you're talking about  yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and i'm still replacing i'm still replacing that in the back especially under the trees um you know kind of slow and and as you say very expensive
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i caught Wolfe with ah ah one ah one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents and i i bought about twenty of them and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i bet you did too and put those down in the spring
 	
 	
 		uh well i put that you know that was laid that was like
 	
 	
 		or the fall yeah because i started to say you can there's different times they say it's okay to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah that was like September i think and i had to water it you know gosh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah keep it damp well my out here you know we don't have as many trees in Plano at least the area where we're over by Collin Creek Mall and but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the pittosporum all died and all those
 		variegated uh things died so we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly and they just live yeah you can you can stand those
 	
 	
 		yeah they're pretty tough uh
 		pittosporum is kind of borderline here and usually it'll do pretty well but uh you know every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals and it it zaps it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		well it's kind of like one of these it's
 	
 	
 		oh wax leaf wax leaf ligustrum is the same way
 	
 	
 		same way um-hum that they warned me of that one finally and i said you know you need to either read Neil Sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery
 		because a lot of places that would are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there and we didn't know the difference and every year we learn one more thing we didn't know before like about these mums it's like okay next year  i'll do pansies
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		your list is growing
 	
 	
 		yes and my backyard we had it really nice and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy and so it was about i guess he's three now so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh gee
 	
 	
 		bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio so it's like our backyard is just kind of like as long as he won't damage it fine and if he'll if there's anything he'll hurt we just don't put it out there anymore
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah kind of cuts your possibilities for flower beds down
 	
 	
 		um-hum very much very much
 	
 	
 		i had a i had a small vegetable garden that uh it did pretty well it's it's like on the side the apron of the of the parkway out behind the garage and uh there's our our garages come in from the back you know from the alley
 	
 	
 		you did
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 		so do ours yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it's that little piece of land over there well i had uh tomatoes and and uh uh peppers
 	
 	
 		what did you grow
 	
 	
 		and i had had okra and cucumbers by the fence i had cucumbers
 	
 	
 		that is amazing
 	
 	
 		which which didn't do real well uh they kind of came out looking like gourds
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well put them in a salad though you say well i made it though at least it's mine
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah but i had squash i had zucchini and and yellow crook neck squash
