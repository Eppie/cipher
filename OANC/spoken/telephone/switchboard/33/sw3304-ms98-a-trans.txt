 
     		
 	
 		i guess we're being recorded what do you have any hobbies that you like to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		oh yeah cycling computers uh backpacking just about everything  you know i generically have you know millions of hobbies
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 		all right that's a interesting assortment my husband's into cycling in fact he's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the the time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		i am not quite that bad i'm just a weekend cyclist
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh do you have any do you do any handicraft type things i think was the question
 	
 	
 		handicraft type things
 	
 	
 		yeah whittle
 	
 	
 		yeah just whittle away my life uh no no i cannot
 	
 	
 		nothing like that i i do some things i've gotten into uh oh i i like to decorate things and i do sweatshirts and tee shirts and i've gotten to where i start have started selling them at craft shows and things and then
 	
 	
 		oh that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		uh you know have have done fairly well at them i've had a a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed but most of them have worked out pretty good there
 	
 	
 		yeah they my only craft work is kind of like computers and you know go off to the little computer club meetings and it's kind of nice because i've made money on it too
 		considering i i work for it a living but i you know i i got a couple of articles published and it's kind of kind of neat
 	
 	
 		oh yeah what what does a computer club do i didn't know there were such things
 	
 	
 		oh yeah just  all over the place they just get around and and talk techy or or else uh you know like half the members are really expert and the other half are like really not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh we kind of help out the people who are really not
 	
 	
 		you don't uh you're not into into hacking or whatever
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i i think i'm i think i'm a hacker but i'm not not kind the not the uh the you know dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers no that's  one of those sports i don't go for
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's that's kind of interesting hobby what else do you you said you did cycling what was the other thing backpacking what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah backpacking yeah i belong to a a Boy Scout troop it beats paying United Way i just you know donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well you that's we have done that uh our two older boys were in Boy Scouts and my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago so we've  uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		done a fair amount of that in our spare time also  but it i that's a great thing to do you know really have you been backpacking anyplace exciting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well just last weekend went to Davy Crockett Forest which is kind of out in east Texas
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we go to uh places out in uh
 		uh let's see what's that what's that state north of us that state yeah yeah that one that one yeah yeah and
 	
 	
 		oh that one okay  to the the uh oh by Fort Sill there do you
 	
 	
 		uh no to another fort uh a old Indian fort that's out there trying to think of the name of it
 		darn uh yeah no sorry no memory
 	
 	
 		uh-huh have have you gone like to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts
 	
 	
 		no i missed out this last year i wasn't able to get the time off but maybe next year it's a good possibility
 	
 	
 		i've always thought that be a real fun thing to do
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  yeah when i was a kid uh we'd do the equivalent thing in the High Sierras and that was loads of fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum does does your whole family like to do it like you you know for a vacation you'd go backpacking
 	
 	
 		uh no not quite because i'm not a whole family i'm just me
 	
 	
 		oh okay you just oh and and you volunteer for the Boy Scouts huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i rent my kids
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well  well sometimes sometimes uh
 	
 	
 		it's it's better than you know owning on them and making payments on them and you know things like that yeah
 	
 	
 		sometimes i think that might not be a bad idea  have uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you said you did it in the High Sierras uh do you ever you know just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah uh  not recently because you know like the Boy Scouts makes it so that i go like once a month you know someplace
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh there's uh some stuff some stuff that i want to do with like Sierra Club and go down the Grand Canyon or something like that
 		so you know they they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you it seems a little just a tad more relaxing
 	
 	
 		well i probably probably  that's uh  well my my other things that i like to do in my spare time i'm i like swimming
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which is in now i've  done that and i i also  if i like something i usually try to figure out how to make money off of it
