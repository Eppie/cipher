 
     		
 	
 		ah i take a lot of magazines that i don't have time to read right away how about you
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well i normally buy them at the grocery store i get like McCalls and Woman's Day and and Ladies' Home Journal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		oh that way you can get them as you as you wanna read them
 	
 	
 		yeah if i have time to read them
 	
 	
 		you know well mine i subscribe and then i'll let them stack up and then and then i'll drop my subscription for a year and catch up
 	
 	
 		i understand that  actually for a while we were taking like Family Handyman and Thousand and One Home Ideas
 	
 	
 		uh you you think you can make
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because our house is like forty five years well fifty years old now  and we were trying to do see what we could do for renovations so
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		oh well that's good do you find the magazines help you on that
 	
 	
 		they really uh they've got a lot of good ideas
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum well we
 	
 	
 		and it it's nice to get i mean at least on those you could get a lot of tips from it which you may not want to do the project exactly like they show you how to do it but at least they'll give you ideas that you can use parts and bits and pieces of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		
 
 		i have a friend who does that with her magazines and she keeps a file and cuts them out then she has them when she needs them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's i've started doing that because i had so many magazines pile up on my desk at work and and around the house is  cutting out recipes and putting them in like a photo album
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		and as long as they're only on one side of the page but that way you know you can do that with recipes out of anything and then little organizing tips and and handy hints around the house and that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i like i like those kind of the women's magazine i guess they're called
 	
 	
 		oh yes oh yes oh yes i think that my husband gets as much out of that recipes as i do on those he likes to read those
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  uh-huh well they've got some some good ideas on things that i probably wouldn't try otherwise  you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true and then you read halfway through the recipe and it's stuff you don't buy otherwise
 	
 	
 		exactly  yeah we do that too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we also take uh A Progressive Farmer and we uh get a lot of hints we uh we have a a weekend farm and we get a lot of hints on gardening from that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then the gardening magazines  and uh i found out that we could plant uh fall potatoes and i'm gonna wait and hope that they grow so uh i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ooh ooh my mother-in-law does a lot of gardening and i know she takes a couple of gardening magazines too as well as as well as seed catalogs
 	
 	
 		a lot of those are in um-hum oh yeah the seed catalogs are fun to look through even if you don't buy them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh i like to look through just when we go down there that's interesting because they have a little a little place outside of Waxahachie so that's nice to go down there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		ooh well that's they used to oh and right where the rain is tonight oh ooh my are they all right
 	
 	
 		yes yes exactly
 		um as far as we know actually i think they're out of town this or they are either on their way back or just got back from Georgia so  hopefully they missed most of the rain
 	
 	
 		well good
 		yeah well on the magazines again it sounds like you and i like about the same things i like to look at the pretty pictures
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i do too and i like to look at some of the fashion things going i'd never buy that for that price i can get it at Target or  somewhere else and i can make do with something a lot closer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh if it's gonna cost that much i'll do with what i already have right or some of the styles are kind of weird too so
 	
 	
 		uh yeah that's a
 		they really are i noticed one today as i was looking through a magazine up again cleaning out my desk and looking for one specific thing and i found an article on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you take this red wool dress knit wool dress and you can accessorize it with beads or with with uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you can put a sweater over it or you can just wear it with leggings or you could wear it with all different jewelry and it's like okay
 	
 	
 		um
 		and bells yeah give you some good ideas
 	
 	
 		that would be cute it would be cute but i couldn't see myself doing any of that  i'm only thirty but i just still can't see myself doing that
 	
 	
 		no oh well
 		oh well there's some of us that are uh
 		don't do things  i i see people come in with the leggings up to whatever and the real short things and i don't know how they but i guess if they feel comfortable in them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		
 
 		well yeah that's i can i like what they call harem pants the baggy slacks but i can't see wearing just the leggings and a a a sweater something like that is like nope sorry not my style not quite
 	
 	
 		oh yeah um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah i was looking at a magazine today at the hairstyles and it was showing what it assumed was i think twelve different styles and they were all cut alike
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but they did something a little different with them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but that that i would be interested in that would be good   if i could actually get my hair to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 		yeah that helps and i course and
 		yeah and course the proverbial diets and uh all that but every book seems to have that diet in it
 	
 	
 		and Mary Ellen's helpful helpful hints and all those now see i like those i think those are fun
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i lost twenty five pounds yeah i lost twenty five pounds now you can do the same oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right sure just eating right seven days a week and um-hum
