 
     		
 	
 		uh you keep up with current events
 	
 	
 		um somewhat yeah not not as well as i would like to probably but that's the way it goes
 	
 	
 		somewhat
 		is that right
 		yeah where where abouts in Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		where in Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		um State College i go to Penn State
 	
 	
 		oh do you well great
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		how's uh well no we're not supposed to talk about that we're supposed to talk about current events  well i'm a current event junkie so i
 	
 	
 		right exactly uh
 	
 	
 		i watch i try to watch the news and i read the newspaper and i like to read Time magazine People magazine keep up what's going on in the world
 	
 	
 		i see well what particularly are you interested in
 	
 	
 		but
 		well i just pretty uh a little you know about everything and not and then again not everything but you know i like to know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		pretty well what's happening so political things don't interest me a great deal except i do like to stay informed enough to
 		feel like i halfway vote intelligently you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		other than that uh i just you know just the events that happen around the world interest me and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and stay in touch with it know feel like i know what's going on now i have to say all three of my children none of them are too interested in current events
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		but i always have been
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i stay up with it but uh how do you how do you uh stay aware of most of the current events uh newspaper
 	
 	
 		um uh well some of both i
 	
 	
 		TV news or what
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		read i read the newspapers sometimes and i watch CNN and that sort of thing occasionally and  i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that's yeah that's good because
 	
 	
 		read magazines and such
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you stay up with it pretty well then
 	
 	
 		well yeah i mean not not that badly anyway so i am i am interested in what's going on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about Haiti recently because i've been down there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes uh-huh
 		oh you've been there well you would be interested in it then
 	
 	
 		and yeah
 		right exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i i follow it you know i don't just read everything about but i i'm always aware of what's going on like that
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and uh because it is it's interesting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i i don't know i feel sorry for those people down there they've just been so
 		terribly mistreated for so many many years you know i mean through Papa Doc i mean he was a terrible tyrant
 	
 	
 		that's true they've never really had a good leader
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it i think it's been better since he died but it's still been bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew uh i i've read some things about him that he was he wasn't too good himself
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah he was pretty pretty much a he didn't mind having people bumped off for
 		certain things you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		that's one one of the reasons US wasn't so you know didn't do more than they did at the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because they weren't all that excited about him although he's probably better than a lot of them but  uh but then again who know you know they're so super so used to it i guess it's the only thing that works
 	
 	
 		yeah so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America and
 	
 	
 		and not that
 		i think it's pretty darned good i think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i really do now i uh they sometimes they jump on it and and and go a little to the extreme the media does but
 		uh but that's kind of understandable because you know it of course if you watch it more than more than once a day i mean it's the same thing over and over and over and over and i listen to the radio watch
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i you hear it so much you get a little tired of it but then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		but i think the quality of our uh our news is just uh i don't believe it could be better
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah well you know i think it probably could be  it always could be better but i'd agree that it's pretty good
 	
 	
 		i really don't
 		i don't think so
 		i don't think our news could be better
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i i mean i mean what else could they do to make it better
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i don't see anything that they could do
 	
 	
 		yeah it well i think that
 		um
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		well you always wanna think everything can be improved upon i i really i understand what you're saying
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		right right i think that
 	
 	
 		but by trial and error over the years i think they got it about as good as they gonna get it
 	
 	
 		well that may be so yeah uh i think that i'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into things how deep they dig into the things and such
 	
 	
 		uh nothing is perfect but
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		well that's uh that's true i understand what you're saying and then again
 		i understand why they can't dig too much deeper that's why we have CNN you know CNN has the time since that's all they do is news to dig deeper
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum right
