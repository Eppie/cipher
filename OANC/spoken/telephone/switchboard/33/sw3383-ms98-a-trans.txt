 
     		
 	
 		seem to have the topic already on top of the tip of your tongue there so why don't you go ahead and start
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah isn't the uh the subject auto repair for tonight yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		yes sir
 	
 	
 		reason i say that is pretty timely because just tonight i went out and changed the oil in my car and that's something i like to do and uh something i
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		something i can do with now the sophisticated auto cars we have today with all the computers and everything
 	
 	
 		right exactly
 	
 	
 		it's uh and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car but i do like to get out and tinker with a car and it's something i can do still do you enjoy working with your car
 	
 	
 		i sure do i uh
 		in fact the last thing i have i've done i can't i don't even remember what it is i've had to have oil changes done myself because i live in an apartment complex where we're not allowed to work on our vehicle we can't even wash our vehicle so
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		oh that's too bad
 	
 	
 		uh but
 		the last thing i can remember doing where i had a sixty six Mustang and that was all right because like you said that was pretechnology days i guess
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and uh you know you could do a lot of it yourself still and uh i didn't tinker too much with the engine it was it was in pretty good shape but
 		my main concern and what i enjoy doing was was the interior and uh it was it was pretty shelled uh but it was fun it taking the whole thing you know the whole interior apart and ordering new carpeting and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and did you install all that yourself
 	
 	
 		right and
 	
 	
 		well that was i bet that was a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		it it was i my wife enjoyed uh she you know helped out a little we sanded down the the insides of the door panels
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and painted those and
 	
 	
 		wow
 		do you still have the car
 	
 	
 		no i sold it
 	
 	
 		well that's too bad A sixty seven Chevrolet uh Mustang is about the uh top  top year for the Mustang  car
 	
 	
 		yeah it was fun though it was fun i i really enjoyed it and i was surprised at at uh the availability of parts yet
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know you can you can still get factory original parts
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but uh you pay a premium but you just don't get them i i didn't i went ahead and got
 		you you know Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made Canada you know prefabs and all that stuff but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it you know that's that's fine i i don't think that there would be uh
 		you know a a quality difference i don't know you wouldn't you didn't notice the difference did you
 	
 	
 		well actually there was
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh i had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate  certain patterns uh exactly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so like the the glove box was just a little little wider little harder to fit in and the carpeting uh
 	
 	
 		oh dear  um-hum
 	
 	
 		stretched a little too far i had to cut some of the sides down
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		but just just little things you know one of the screws on on the door regulator uh window regulators you could get three of the three of the four to lineup the fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did
 	
 	
 		oh i bet that was frustrating wasn't it
 	
 	
 		you know thing
 		oh it was but the end result is after you put your your panels on nobody sees that you got one screw missing in your your window regulator anyway and it it runs it works just the same so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right
 		yeah that's that's true well you know that that is something i really enjoy doing um working on our car too the uh i just changed my oil oil tonight but uh
 		i enjoy also working on things like the brakes and uh in fact just two weeks ago i helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car
 		and uh either if it's a drum or or disc brakes i enjoy working on those kind of things
 	
 	
 		disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem but
 		i i honestly i don't have the tools for the drum i know you got uh certain spring lever that you got to have or some uh some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch
 	
 	
 		yeah spoons and
 		yes you do
 	
 	
 		uh my dad's got all that and and i i helped him when i was growing up but i don't have that stuff now comes to drum brakes i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know don't have any choice but to take them in
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true and you know it it doesn't doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too because
 		um i was helping my neighbor out and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced
 		and i don't have of course the equipment to do that so he took it into a shop and had it resurfaced uh resurfaced and and fixed that way but yeah it is true uh you know
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i did have a sixty four Ford truck that i wish i still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it because you didn't have all the extra extra stuff that's in there now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		i'll tell you what the other the nicest thing about them is uh everything was standard you didn't have to worry about finding a metric anything
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		boy i tell you
 	
 	
 		and you know
