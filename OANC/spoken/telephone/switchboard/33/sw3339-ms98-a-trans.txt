 
     		
 	
 		hey Patty uh we're supposed to talk about uh child care
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		my children are all grown
 	
 	
 		huh i don't have any  no
 	
 	
 		and you don't have any  well some day you will and then then you'll be real selective about choosing a child care right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah i worked at a child care center for about a week
 	
 	
 		well you know all about them then well tell me about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that was all i could take not so much the kids as the children but because of the director
 	
 	
 		oh those
 		you didn't like the director yeah
 	
 	
 		hum-um but um i had about ten children in a class  and i just know they take a lot of energy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh boy i bet it did
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my wife worked at a child care quite a few years ago and she liked it all right when her
 	
 	
 		huh how long did she work there
 	
 	
 		oh i think she worked there about two years our
 	
 	
 		gosh she must be very patient
 	
 	
 		two or three years well we had small children at the time see so so uh it worked out pretty good she'd be there with some of them and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh broke her in
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		and uh it worked out real good it was a church school where we we went to church there  and uh she worked there
 	
 	
 		good
 		hm
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but uh i have uh all my children are grown now and they have their children in day care one one of them keeps her child with a  with a relative though
 	
 	
 		hm
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh but the other one has used a day care for her children
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		nice when you have relatives that can do that
 	
 	
 		yeah they they uh her her husband's sister and she needs the money and and plus she you know she's close and gives him good care and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it's
 		does she have kids too or
 	
 	
 		and she has kids too and he's just a baby but he does enjoy though she has twins and they're two or three years older than him but they
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		all spoil him you know and he key likes it watching them play and everything  but uh
 	
 	
 		hm um-hum
 		well even with um two teachers in my class with ten kids  it was still quite a handful
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i'm sure it was i wouldn't you couldn't pay me to work in one you know you got to like you just got to you know not mind children that much
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 		um-hum yep
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		because they try your patience you know not on purpose not on purpose but they just get into everything and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well of course that's just the way they are
 	
 	
 		uh-huh running around and diaper changing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and when you don't have children of your own that's not a lot of fun is it  well but you probably will some day reckon
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum right
 		um yeah first i need to get married though first i need to get married  uh-huh  oh
 	
 	

 		plenty
 		huh
 		well yeah but you got plenty of time to do that you sound pretty young
 		but uh so i don't have a whole lot of experience with day care centers myself now either
 	
 	
 		hm um-hum
 		well this one was pretty good um
 	
 	
 		was it in Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh North Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and since that the director was really really picky about kind of silly things you know nothing that really had to do with you know endangering the child or anything you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um like she didn't like the way i answered the phone or you know she didn't like this she didn't like that things that didn't have anything to do with the children so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh i thought it might have been something that the state required but that wouldn't
 	
 	
 		um-hum no it just she had such high expectations about silly little things you know
 	
 	
 		that wouldn't apply to that would it
 		uh-huh that didn't make sense uh
 	
 	
 		right so but i probably could've put up with you know the kids and  all that but it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well and it those kind it probably didn't pay a whole lot either
 	
 	
 		nope huh-uh nope
 	
 	
 		so if it doesn't pay a whole lot it's hard to put up with a lot of
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that Mickey Mouse stuff that's my other line but i no i'll just ignore it while
 	
 	
 		you wanna grab it real quick or because it'll be recorded i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll just i'll just ignore it and if they want anything they'll  in a little while
 	
 	
 		okay
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		since we got
 	
 	
 		so are you you said your kids have kids or
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i have four grandchildren
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and they're happy with their day care centers or
 	
 	
 		yeah well neither one of them have them in a day care center right now but uh um my my daughter that  has has three sons she is a
 	
 	
 		oh huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you still there aren't you
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess it was that thing hanging up uh she had him in one and was real happy with it and then got unhappy with it and then she moved him to another one and was just real happy with it it's in Garland
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh she had really i'd say she had pretty good experiences with them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh oh yeah the one she the first one she quit they'd lost his medicine
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		sent it home with another kid and it made her mad but i mean that's you know you got fifty kids there i could see that happening
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you course you lose a fifty dollar bottle of medicine but it looks like somebody
 	
 	
 		ooh you'd wanna be reimbursed at least
 	
 	
 		well it looks like they would've whoever took it home would've brought it back
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but anyway it made her real mad that's why she left it but other than that i mean it you know they'd been real good too so i'd i'd say she's had really you know real good experiences with them
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		nothing no horror stories or you know of course they're regulated pretty strictly by the state
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum yep
 	
 	
 		and uh which is good
 	
 	
 		yeah
