 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		do i recycle cans that's about it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		aluminum cans
 	
 	
 		yeah my son
 	
 	
 		do you recycle newspapers or anything
 	
 	
 		no because there's no really place i think if they had more visible places for you to drop stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		people would do it more instead of trying you know it's because it's hard it's bad enough you got to save the stuff but then you got to go find somewhere to put it if they
 	
 	
 		i think they would
 		right how about glass jars those are recyclable but
 	
 	
 		none of it  i mean see at at work all i do is paper and trash and cans
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and then at home i just save cans because i i know where that is that's like on the way to work but i don't know where the paper and the the bottles and all that stuff is but i think if like apartment complexes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		honey i'm on the phone long distance
 	
 	
 		how
 	
 	
 		had to yell at my kids had to yell at my kids
 	
 	
 		how many kids you got
 	
 	
 		well i have four
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and we try and recycle my husband is in the packaging business and um they use recycled newspapers shredded up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for the filler for uh it's a pad that they put on top top of apples boxed apples when they ship apples and it absorbs some of the you know the when the apples get the shipping you know
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 		oh i know yeah my husband my husband hauls apples
 	
 	
 		oh he does for what company what trucking company
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh he's independent he hauls them for anybody
 	
 	
 		oh that's great well he may have some of our apples then probably Washington's a very big apple growing
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		place especially Yakima you'll have to look for Yakima Washington on some of the box labels and CVC Weyerhaeuser that's us
 	
 	
 		yep
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's us well so they have a recycling actually they it's called Central Washington Recycling and they have a a whole center and they have it set up like a circus
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where you know the green glass goes in this clown's mouth and the tin cans go up to the alligator and and so we uh we don't recycle as much as we should but we do recycle newspapers
 		and cans and bottles
 	
 	
 		yeah i think if they would if they would have it more where you can get it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		get to it you know like in different places like apartment complexes they got trash cans why not put the dumpsters for different things and uh and and that way people would find it better
 	
 	
 		right
 		right i think that'd be a great idea we're gonna
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but if you can't find it
 	
 	
 		i would like to see them i would
 	
 	
 		who's gonna save it you know because after a while you get tired of saving newspapers i mean
 	
 	
 		yes you do you sure do in fact i put mine in my garage and i'm sick of them but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we take them my little girl she gets a collect the money you know since she has to haul them down there every day so i let her keep the money um i was thinking the other day about um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		plastic gloves that the dentists and doctors and everybody has to wear now that'd be wonderful if they could recycle those you know as it is now they can't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but see those are
 		they can't
 	
 	
 		well i think they're nonrecyclable
 	
 	
 		yeah i think because of the the disease and all that going around they don't know
 		you know they're they're calling them uh like what do you call it contaminated yeah
 	
 	
 		right
 		contaminated is what they are you know they but that you know plastic just doesn't disintegrate
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		and that that's major thing i mean how many pairs of gloves they go through in a day
 	
 	
 		they use pair of gloves for every patient they see
 	
 	
 		right and i'm just thinking about the orthodontist where i take my child you know for his braces
 	
 	
 		they use gloves for everybody i mean the the nurse you the the dentist his assistant everybody in there has on gloves and and then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep
 		yep everybody yep well it's too bad that they have to but be nice if those somehow could be recycled
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know that'd be better for everybody
 	
 	
 		yep but they don't recycle those so
 	
 	
 		and then the baby diapers you know i don't have anybody in diapers any more but gosh i used my share of disposable diapers
 	
 	
 		now i didn't use those i had a a diaper service
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		in the service because i couldn't my son was allergic to something in the plastic
 	
 	
 		oh yep
 	
 	
 		so i had  so it wasn't by choice
 	
 	
 		yeah but that's
 	
 	
 		that i couldn't use them it's just he couldn't wear them for some reason i don't know what it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i used them with my last two uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he couldn't wear them because of the something was he was allergic to something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i had to put regular diapers on him boy that was a you know for a while i had the service but then you know after i didn't have it the whole time but the first i think the first
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah it gets really expensive yeah but see i think if people go back to cloth diapers that's better for recycling i mean that's better for the environment
 	
 	
 		yeah because you can always you just wash those you know so
 	
 	
 		sure well i see in the future i see people uh being more conscious of we're gonna be forced to recycle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i see even plastic shopping bags there's you can return those and our grocery bags our paper grocery bags has a five cent refund on them if you bring them back to the store do yours there
 	
 	
 		you can return those
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh they do oh that's oh
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh if they did that i would take them back all the time because i go to the same store all the time
 	
 	
 		well see and i always forget and you know with four kids and you know six people in this family our grocery bill's pretty high and you know i get you know thirty or more than that yeah i get fifty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i think if they'd do it more with the with the money like a nickel or penny even though people think it's not enough but if you have enough
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		uh people don't understand a quarter's a quarter it doesn't matter
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you you know my son could take a quarter and go buy him a candy bar or something but i
 	
 	
 		you bet oh yeah
