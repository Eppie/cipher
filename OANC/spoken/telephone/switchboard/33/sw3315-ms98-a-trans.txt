 		hi
 	
 	
 		hi my name is Leslie
 	
 	
 		hi i'm Jennifer
 	
 	
 		and where are you from
 	
 	
 		Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		oh nice i'm from Dallas Texas
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 	
 	
 		well did you understand what this was for you know what it was for what we
 	
 	
 		um television shows sure that sounds good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay  i i don't watch too many but we can try it are you ready to start okay just a minute
 	
 	
 		okay
 		sure am
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay i guess we're recording now
 	
 	
 		yeah okay
 	
 	
 		what are your favorite television shows
 	
 	
 		well i don't really watch too many TV shows other than uh occasionally i'll i'll turn on Donahue because it comes on in the morning when i seem to be getting ready around here
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh so if if there's no one else around you know it's just me and i have a chance to listen to something i'll turn that on but uh just for the  for the conversation factor i think
 		but and then i think i enjoy when i catch it i don't even know what night it's on but Designing Women sometimes
 	
 	
 		oh i love that show yes that is great
 	
 	
 		yeah do you
 		yeah it's fun and then there's a new one that started out that i've caught occasionally a couple of times called Good and Evil i think
 	
 	
 		oh i heard they just canceled that i read in today's paper they just canceled that show
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		it is a real different one it's um it's it's different i guess i watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that i have to see it but
 	
 	
 		
  
 		have you seen the show it's it's new this year called Home Front
 	
 	
 		no i haven't watched that
 	
 	
 		oh it's it's really good it's um
 		i think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven and it's set in post World War Two times
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through it's really interesting
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's kind of like a soap a nighttime soap opera type thing
 	
 	
 		sounds neat
 	
 	
 		it is it's a good it's really well written
 	
 	
 		is that on what channel what station
 	
 	
 		um i don't even know to tell you the truth
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		what other shows do you like
 	
 	
 		um i prefer Oprah Winfrey to Donahue
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well she comes on later and i usually have kids around so i don't end end up watching that one is the only problem i have with it i guess
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		i did watch soap operas but i work full-time now and can't catch those anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		except when i'm home sick and now when i watch them i think why did i ever watch those
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		they're stupid
 		so when i did watch them i was addicted to them every day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but not anymore
 	
 	
 		that can happen
 		so do you know of any other shows in the evening or something that you enjoy
 	
 	
 		oh um tonight i'm looking forward to seeing Golden Girls
 	
 	
 		oh that's always fun
 	
 	
 		yes i like that show
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and if i can stay up late enough i like to catch Saturday Night Live every now and then
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's exciting we're winning so that's really exciting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think
 		i also course like to catch the news during the evening hours but uh it's a little tough because that's when i'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time so usually i don't get a whole lot of news watching in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yes we watch CNN in the morning while we're getting ready
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for the day and eating breakfast
 		we'll catch our news that way
 		watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		so what have you seen interesting on Oprah Winfrey lately
 	
 	
 		lately i haven't been catching it because of my work schedule um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i can't remember the last time i saw it it's been a while
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not
 	
 	
 		i don't know sometimes they come on and and say
 	
 	
 		oh that's right
 	
 	
 		well today on CNN they were talking about
 		something like this about um
 		learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing helping them get a database for words
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's really interesting
 	
 	
 		it is interesting
 	
 	
 		do you work for Texas Instruments
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		no no just uh doing this as a fund-raiser for our church
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah so it kind of makes it easy you know to do a little something for it
 	
 	
 		sure because we uh we've talked to a lot of people from Texas it seems so we thought well maybe they work from for Dallas
