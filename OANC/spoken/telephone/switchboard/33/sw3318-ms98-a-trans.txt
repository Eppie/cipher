 
     		
 	
 		got to discuss movies you seen a movie recently Mark
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh yeah as a matter of fact uh most recently i saw uh  Dead Again
 	
 	
 		i've heard that was real good
 	
 	
 		yeah i liked i liked it uh i went with a girlfriend of mine
 	
 	
 		and enjoyed it huh who's the star
 	
 	
 		yeah it's
 		oh jeez  you know i don't even remember now
 	
 	
 		but it was good is it it's not a comedy is it
 	
 	
 		no it's uh
 	
 	
 		oh i know uh yeah i know the movie you're talking about yeah that guy and his wife star in it Brannigan or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i can't i can't even remember who's in it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah where they were married years before or something
 	
 	
 		yeah they were they were married and then uh so the let's see who was it the the the maid the maid kills the wife and then the the husband yeah the
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i know what you're talking about
 		Kenneth Braun
 		oh really i didn't know the story but i knew it got a good review
 	
 	
 		yeah the maid kills the wife and the husband dies years later something and they both come back as new people and it all kind of happens again
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh i bet that was interesting sounds interesting
 	
 	
 		it was it was kind of strange
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i had the i i read the most reviews don't see too many movies we rent a few on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we don't go to them but i do enjoy a good movie i guess uh the most recent one i can think of that i saw was uh on the TV on the you know rental was Home Again did you see that Home Alone i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i saw that uh just a couple weeks ago as a matter of fact i finally got to see it
 	
 	
 		did you well it's been a little longer than that since i saw it but it was the first time i seen it and i thought boy about three fourths of the way boy i thought what a i can't believe this movie is so highly rated
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		until about the last ten fifteen to twenty thirty minutes of it then it then i was just rolling in the floor it was just hilarious
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think that's what it i think that's what it is is it's that last you know fifteen thirty minutes or so that people really get into it and they go hey this is a good movie
 	
 	
 		but i was really bored with it for so long
 		that would made the movie yeah it really is it was just hilarious but i did enjoy that well what else have you seen lately
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh  i also saw uh
 		the last of the uh Nightmare on Elm Street series uh
 	
 	
 		i never have seen any of those they must be good i like some of those kind of movies was this one pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah um this this last one here wasn't very good at all it was it was only like an hour and a half long hour and fifteen minutes
 	
 	
 		it wasn't
 		uh-huh
 		oh really i can't believe it was so short
 	
 	
 		and uh it was i mean it was just boom it's over and and it wasn't very good the the three D effect that they have for the last twenty minutes of it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		one of the worst i've seen yeah it's it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and it truly is supposed to be the last of that series isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah it is um the uh
 	
 	
 		maybe it's a good thing they bury it huh
 	
 	
 		well the the writer director of the series is is going on to a new plot of of horror  i i i saw his new movie commercial on the other day i don't remember what it's called
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so he's moving on uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		on to another another topic of of horror yeah
 	
 	
 		of horror film  well well it's been
 	
 	
 		when you when you when you do it for so long it's all you ever basically know how to do is horror films
 	
 	
 		well that but if you you know if it's probably made him a extremely rich man too if it's successful i guess just keep with it  go to a different
 	
 	
 		yeah most likely
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		different territory seem that's sure done wonders for old Stephen King hasn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah really  even even even with crazy women that try to claim that he stole their story and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		writing all those horror
 		yeah isn't that crazy i don't think he did do you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no he's he's got too much integrity to do something like that yeah it it just
 	
 	
 		that and he's too successful and and too too warped a mind
 	
 	
 		i i think it just happened that some woman looked like you know kind of the character and everything and she decided well i can just say this is my story and
 	
 	
 		sure yeah and they say oh that's mine he stole they're trying to get some money that's all basically all they're trying to do i i would think anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		but i can't let's see i'm trying to think of another movie that i've seen lately and i can't think of
 	
 	
 		i i saw another rented one uh friend of mine rented it
 		i can't remember the name of it
 	
 	
 		isn't that funny you see them
 	
 	
 		must not have been good if i can't remember the name
 	
 	
 		you see them all the time and when you try to recall
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you you i've i've watched so many movies here in the last few months just you know seeing ones that i haven't seen before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well it's good entertainment and it's it's so easy to do
 	
 	
 		yeah you can go to Blockbuster and get you a movie and you know three or four people can watch it rather than paying six seven dollars and
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 		yeah Blockbuster's so successful i we don't go to them we just go  we don't watch that many but when we do we just go up here to Kroger because on Tuesday they're ninety nine cents each for all their movies if you get down there in the morning you can you know get some pretty darn good movies
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh but boy Blockbuster lot of people do go to them don't they
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've got a a membership card at two different Blockbusters i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh one one would doesn't work at all of them
 	
 	
 		no they they they issue a different card for each Blockbuster it's it's got their their particular address on it and stuff so that you don't try to take movies back to the wrong Blockbuster
 	
 	
 		got to have each
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah
 		oh i see well and it's successful the way they're running it so can't knock it
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i had moved for a while and that's when i got the other one and then i came back home so i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
