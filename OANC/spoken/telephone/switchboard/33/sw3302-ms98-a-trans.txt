 
     		
 	
 		well Charlie what do you think should we spend more on AIDS research or stay the same
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i don't i don't think we're uh spending enough so i i think we should i that i should i think we should spend more
 	
 	
 		why do you think we don't spend enough
 	
 	
 		uh
 		let's see
 		um you know to tell you the truth i i couldn't tell you exactly i couldn't tell you what we're spending but from what i from what i hear um
 		from most of the AIDS uh you know just reading about AIDS advocacy groups and oh people like that uh there have been a couple of deaths um lately uh like one lady that was on the President's AIDS committee
 		um that we're not i it just doesn't seem like we're taking the disease as as seriously as we need to
 		uh lot of lot of talk about it but we're doesn't i don't know what do you think
 	
 	
 		well i agree with you i think we have a lot of talk but not dollars and you know we we situation  our situation where
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we're faced with people that
 		you know choose a lifestyle that may cause AIDS  but then at the same token there are a lot of people like the children in Florida
 		who didn't choose a lifestyle
 		but there was not help for them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i think one of the things we can do as far as the government goes is just to dispel some of the myths
 		you know drinking from a water fountain will give you AIDS
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		using a restroom will give you AIDS
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but at the same token i feel like heart disease cancer
 		multiple sclerosis
 		where do we put those in perspective to AIDS
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i wonder what i don't know what the statistics are but i think uh
 		it's uh the numbers of of people infected do you know any have any idea what they are what they're estimating now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i don't and you know i'm like you i do not know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i you know what it
 	
 	
 		what the government is spending on AIDS
 	
 	
 		yeah what what i think is that is that somehow in in our most a lot of our minds it's still a disease that affects primarily homosexuals and intravenous drug users
 		but what we're finding is that that that it's
 		it's um also it's affecting a lot more people than that that that there's a lot more um uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 	
 	
 		heterosexual transmission of the disease than than we probably thought
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so
 		and you know i mean as long it's as long as it's um limited to those
 		two select you know two kind of narrow areas homosexuals and intravenous drug users it it it's probably gonna get unfortunately sad to say a lot more lip service than it will actually actually dollars
 		and uh it might be that  as it spreads among the general population more that that uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and and in all these stories about these kids who had transfusions and these
 		oh there's been a couple housewives lately that were you know national news that they had had transfusions transfusions uh transfusions and they you know and they're they're they died you know and left behind families and oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		well i'm in Texas and we have a teacher that died from AIDS
 	
 	
 		oh you you all did in your uh in your school school district or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well not my school district but it was in the state of Texas and it was because of a transfusion and i think that got a lot more publicity because again it wasn't a minority group
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know we're looking at a situation that hopefully can be controlled
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know yeah i don't know kind of kind of scary actually
 	
 	
 		it is frightening you know because it could be you or i and then what what would we do we'd want help
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what are what are you gonna do if you're in an auto accident and uh you had need a blood transfusion are you gonna have confidence in the blood supply
 		i don't i don't i don't know that i would
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		or will
 	
 	
 		yeah well my mother had a blood transfusion about four years ago and i i was scared to even mention to her
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that there was an emergency situation we couldn't give she couldn't give her blood we couldn't go down to give her our blood for her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know there's always the possibility
 	
 	
 		yeah and and i think as long as it's uh as long as it's still people that are thinking that it's mostly even people that that it's almost like because they're choosing to practice those lifestyles that they're choosing you know that's their choice
 		that they ran that risk i mean i you know that's probably i hate to say that that sounds cruel
 	
 	
 		no but the i agree with you
 	
 	
 		uh that sounds cold cold and cruel but that's probably
 		as long as people perceive of it being that way i i mean that probably explains the lack of um lack of concrete money and being spent
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think it's you know
 	
 	
 		yep
