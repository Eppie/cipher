 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh well i guess social change takes in a a big category
 		but uh
 		i guess the the one aspect of it that i took in uh consideration uh is more economical
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i i know that the the amount of
 		or or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has has greatly changed
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		i know they they did a it was on a talk show uh they took uh uh the parents and then the uh the son and they compared income
 		at different points in time when the when the father was you know was a little bit younger and more in his heyday and they and they compared to the son's that he was making now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and even though the son was probably more successful you know higher up in the the management ladder uh his he was actually making less money
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and when you costs when you go by a costs of living
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 		i guess depending on where you live though too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know just uh just with me ten years ago i i was comparing uh i think i i was living better
 		ten years ago than i am now even though i'm making more money now but my dollar went a lot farther
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		true uh ten years ago i was eleven so um i remember though like
 		buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now and gas and i used to hear stories from my Grandpa and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i know gas prices have definitely jumped uh from uh i know i used to pay twenty five cents a gallon and now it's
 		over a buck i don't know what it's uh by you and around here Minnesota Wisconsin area it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it's dropping but i think it's about a dollar fifteen on an average
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm from Wisconsin yeah it's about um yeah
 	
 	
 		okay yeah
 		well that's uh that's unusual most of the people i talk to are Texas so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i spoke to a person from Texas too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this is only my second phone call so i'm  just waiting for more
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i suppose this will be one of my towards my last one pretty soon i'm sure they'll stop me but uh
 		i'm uh i'm pretty much out of things say
 		to say
 	
 	
 		oh about like social changes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hum
 		um
 		i i don't think this would have anything to do with it but like clothing and styles lot of those changed
 	
 	
 		okay yeah i i i don't think they they consider
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like i said it's a broad category it's just uh not economical but yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh even attitudes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		definitely
 	
 	
 		on on clothing and stuff uh i know
 	
 	
 		towards each other
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i know a lot of the things that that we wear men wear now a days were would've been considered uh feminine uh many years ago
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		but the uh i know it's been it was hard for me at first but now i kind of like you know a lot of the bright colors
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean like i think i used to be more uh conservative and just your basic colors but now i i do like some of these uh
 		brighter fluorescent colors
 	
 	
 		yeah but they styles come and go all the time though it's just ridiculous fads in and out
 		and even um clothing from the sixties came back i see a lot of um girls wearing sixties clothes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i i guess uh the best thing i like to see from the sixties and seventies is of course is the mini skirt of course
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		one of the nice things but uh yeah i i i don't think that there's anything as original it's it's all based on uh one of the past styles they just uh
 		make their uh circle and come back again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so if you hang onto your clothes long enough uh they'll they'll be back in style in a few years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true  maybe
 		some day i probably won't be alive to see it but prices might go down lot more i don't know though doesn't look good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think like thinking back i think the only style i hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember that i do
 	
 	
 		i guess when i look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms i say God
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i didn't really care for them either uh or now i won't
