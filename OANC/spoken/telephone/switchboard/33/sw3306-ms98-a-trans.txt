 		no i don't do you
 	
 	
 		no i don't i i've had one for quite a few years but i've i've not had one the last couple of years
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but it's something i've always enjoyed do you do you like boating yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i love them
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		my children all have been grown for a couple years and we were using it less and less and less so
 		we decided to sell it
 		and
 	
 	
 		well i heard that's the second happiest day of your life
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		the day you sell your boat
 	
 	
 		oh no now i loved having a boat
 	
 	
 		no i just heard that that's just a joke i guess
 	
 	
 		i loved having it no
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		first best day is the day you get and the day you get rid of it but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i'd like to have one i just don't know if i'd have the time to
 		use it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah a guy just you know he needs his weekends free or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to be able to use it or a day during the week or something but
 		but no i guess for the cost of them you don't really it's hard to get i don't know i felt like i got my money's worth out of mine i had bought it used and
 		kept it uh i don't know ten years and got within uh
 	
 	
 		did
 	
 	
 		three hundred dollars of what when i sold it of what i'd paid for it and had it all those years you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so they hold their you take care of them they hold their value real well
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		so you know you couldn't complain about that
 	
 	
 		did you go fishing
 	
 	
 		no no it was a
 		uh big boat big ski boat type thing
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i had a hundred hundred sixty horse uh
 		Mercruiser in it inboard outboard
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		oh i did fish out of it occasionally but i'm not too much of a fisherman
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and uh but i but i did enjoy owning a boat would recommend it to anybody and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i like to fish
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but uh and now sailing i've never been sailing have you been sailing
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i've sailed some i just like uh fourteen foot Sunfish

 		nothing big
 		yeah really
 		well they offer classes out at uh Ray Hubbard
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i've always thought i'd like to i've never wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and at this stage of the game i'm not that interested in it anymore
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		we go out with friends on the
 		we go to the lake just about every weekend down at Mount Vernon and uh
 		my parents' next door neighbors have a big barge and we go out and take them out on their barge they're getting kind of old and they like us to take them out on their barge quite often so we we get out on the water occasionally you know
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh that's nice
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh anyway it's
 		it's fun i i do enjoy the lake but
 		uh once the children were grown and we'd go down there and i'd get the boat out on the
 		you know Saturday and we'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much it's such a pretty lake down there we'd enjoy it so much and
 		i'd say well i'm gonna leave the boat out because uh we'll probably do this again tomorrow
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it got to where the tomorrow the boat was still sitting there and we never did go out again and i'd have to go load it up the next day and
