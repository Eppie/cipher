 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what kind of a house do you live in
 	
 	
 		uh i'm in a uh in a ranch a uh it was about uh sixteen hundred square feet when i bought it and uh it's about two thousand square feet now but it's one of those typical
 		uh ranches that you find around here oh it's uh built in the
 		probably built in the late fifties so it's not um what you would find uh
 		uh where you live but uh
 		for the older um ranch homes it's pretty typical i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well our home is uh probably for our area it's probably one of the lower
 		income homes out here  um
 		most of the the homes that they're building well i shouldn't say all of them but most of them
 		now are up in the
 		millions of dollars oh oh yeah there's
 	
 	
 		really
 		how many square feet do you have
 	
 	
 		we have got about uh twenty
 		i'd say about twenty four hundred
 	
 	
 		four bedrooms
 	
 	
 		um we've got five bedrooms because we built on to our garage a a bedroom for my mother
 	
 	
 		five bedrooms
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i made a i made a fourth bedroom out of uh i i made a fourth bedroom out of one of our out of our living room and then
 		added a uh what we call a sunroom to get the you know when we when we added four hundred square feet to our house
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		so yeah
 	
 	
 		well this this house is very comfortable we've got two living areas and that that's the thing i probably like the most about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how many stories just one
 	
 	
 		it's just one story yeah it's a Fox and Jacobs home
 	
 	
 		how are they built
 	
 	
 		um we've been real happy with it
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard the i've heard the construction's pretty good on Fox and Jacobs
 	
 	
 		course i'm not a carpenter or anything like that they could probably come in and say gee this is not straight and this is under something that
 	
 	
 		but i mean it doesn't give you trouble
 	
 	
 		no no we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no cracked slab or anything like that
 	
 	
 		no we've been real lucky
 	
 	
 		um
 		and is it um uh natural gas and
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you know what i miss though basements
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i sure i sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've heard a lot of people say that that's for sure uh we have an attic that we've just put you know plywood over over the beams and things up in the attic and so that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		so you
 	
 	
 		has replaced it to some extent but certainly not
 	
 	
 		can you stand up in it
 	
 	
 		uh in parts i mean you couldn't you really couldn't use it for a room
 	
 	
 		so you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it's ours is pitched so shallow that you uh don't get much room in the attic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we uh we've got you know i'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there
 	
 	
 		so five bedrooms and two living two  family things
 	
 	
 		two living areas we have a living room and dining room at the front of the house and then we have a the uh family room kitchen and play room
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		at the rear of the house which has been really nice
 		in fact i really enjoy the playroom that you you would think that would not be a real
 		bonus you know to a house but of all the rooms in the house i'd say that was
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that was the one that's been really nice to have
 	
 	
 		isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time
 	
 	
 		i think that's true yeah probably our family room's the the biggest uh
 	
 	
 		you can
 		right some people i mean families seem to migrate towards one one room and carry on most of their activities there and uh uh some rooms uh we have one room that we never use i mean might as well not even heat and cool it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		strange
 	
 	
 		well that's kind of the way our living room dining room is but it is nice to have it because there's uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment
 	
 	
 		right right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		so you've been fairly happy with it how long have you been in it
 	
 	
 		seventeen years
 	
 	
 		wow boy it doesn't seem that long but it is because we uh came to this area about the same time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we've been fifteen fifteen years in the in the house that we're living in
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and we the the principal feature i like about ours is that it's pier and beam
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yours is a slab i assume
 	
 	
 		yes it is
 	
 	
 		yeah ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that i could not have done if it was slab i've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		by myself and saved a lot of money that i couldn't have done if the house was on a slab
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting well
 	
 	
 		but that's because it's so old it's uh thirty five thirty six years old when they used to build like that and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		well my husband wouldn't do that anyway
 		that's his that's his worst thing in
 	
 	
 		i know he's not handy right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		life is to
 		have to repair something
 	
 	
 		i on the other hand seem um
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		do a lot too much of it and uh i've gotten good at it which in a in a way is bad because then you uh you start to take pleasure in it
 	
 	
 		well uh that's great uh we just kind of save everything for when Al uh for for when his uh dad comes to visit and then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he does all the repairing you know he does
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		my dad is actually uh
