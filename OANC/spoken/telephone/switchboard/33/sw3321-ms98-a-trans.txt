 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh do you have a do you have a personal computer
 	
 	
 		yes i do i've had one
 		ever since uh like oh nineteen seventy four i
 		had several since then uh i built my first one from a kit
 	
 	
 		oh A two or one of those L two
 	
 	
 		uh it was an  a S 100 bus uh model
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i don't know if you remember the old uh MIPS computers
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh well
 	
 	
 		is out of San Antonio originally wasn't it
 	
 	
 		uh San were they out of San Antonio i thought they were i thought they were out of uh
 		uh New Mexico
 	
 	
 		i really
 		it it
 	
 	
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		i may be confused on that but i remember seeing the ads in Popular Science
 		uh i bought my first one in nineteen eighty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		what kind do you have now
 	
 	
 		uh now i have uh just a regular PC clone
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's the 8088 uh
 		it's an old one i've had it for oh i guess five years now
 	
 	
 		well uh
 	
 	
 		kind do you what kind do you have
 	
 	
 		well actually i'm between PC's right now i put my i i had an old one and i kind of got put it up on the shelf
 		and i bought one for uh for the family use and i've given that one to my son it's a two eighty six
 		a two eighty six clone uh an AT clone
 		and i've given that to him and he has it up in his room which means i can still use it but uh
 	
 	
 		that's right um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's not readily available so i usually end up bringing home a
 		we have a little portable in the office and when i need to do something i usually bring that one home
 	
 	
 		um-hum is that the laptop type or the yeah those are real convenient
 	
 	
 		a laptop yes
 		they uh
 		they're real convenient but sometimes they're kind of heavy to carry around because you get
 		
 
 		you know you get kind of tired if you have to walk a whole lot and i guess it's uh it's all what we get used to it's certainly better than to have a whole machine to take apart
 		my first machine was um
 		a Tandy model one or an old Radio Shack model one and
 	
 	
 		um-hum yes
 	
 	
 		that was like moving to take that apart
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes sir it's still lighter
 		bust box
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah uh i i sold model one uh model threes i guess for a while in my store
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i had a personal computer computer store for a while
 	
 	
 		oh you did
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well that
 		at the time that was a good business i think now it's pretty cut throat isn't it
 	
 	
 		it's extremely cut throat now yeah i was uh you know it was sort of uh just before the uh IBM PC came out
 	
 	
 		ah
 		well i know uh
 		my model one i put a lots of you know lots of hours on it
 		but it was obsolete fairly quickly
 		it became nothing but a word processor for me so i could do uh
 		you know do letters and things like that at home
 		and uh you know i had
 		let's see i think i had about twenty seven hundred dollars in that little system because i had uh several the floppy drives and all of that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know twenty seven hundred dollars today will buy you a pretty well equipped four eighty six
 	
 	
 		uh that's about right yes you can get a a real screamer for twenty seven hundred now it's amazing
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it's  you look at the computer power that the you know the personal computers put on our desk compare it you know with the you know i guess the the first computer i used with a a 7094 or something like that
 		and uh i mean you this is the you know you have more sitting in your desk than the whole building then
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um my little model one is a thirty two K and i made the great advancement of of uh kicking it up to forty eight K memory
 		and uh you know that was just a big deal in those days
 	
 	
 		my first computer came uh i had a four K memory board with with yeah it's four K
 	
 	
 		four K oh
 		did you ever wonder what you'd do all with all the four K
 	
 	
 		well at that time i was programming an assembly language right uh and and i had a cassette tape for my memory
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		for my storage i didn't have a floppy
 		and uh
 		it was uh you know you you there was you there was still a press to have more memory i mean grew went from four to sixteen and it made a big jump to thirty two and you know
 	
 	
 		yes i uh
 		i think i paid
 		what did i pay i paid a
 		a pretty good chunk of money something like thirty or forty dollars just
 		to buy the chips to upgrade mine of course
 		they it already had sockets on the boards because they had already uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know they they had the board set up with the sockets in it so it it wasn't that bad but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know now uh
 		machine i bring home has two megabytes two megabytes of RAM and
