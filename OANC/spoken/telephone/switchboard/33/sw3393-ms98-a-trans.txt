 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what do you guys having up there i haven't been up there since oh Lord forty eight i guess  well no no it wasn't forty eight it was it was uh
 	
 	
 		forty eight that's a long time  um
 	
 	
 		let's see yeah it was forty eight i was in the Air Force
 		we did an we did an air show out at uh out at uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Bowling Green no out at um Andrews yeah
 	
 	
 		Andrews
 	
 	
 		so what's it been like up there
 	
 	
 		well for the past week or two it's been cold and wet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but before that for  most of the year it's been hot and dry
 	
 	
 		yeah uh like September was hot and drier October
 	
 	
 		um September's really was i'm not sure about October i think for about twelve months through September the the average temperature had been higher than normal each month
 	
 	
 		really huh
 	
 	
 		um lots of ninety degree days during the summer
 	
 	
 		it really has been strange here this year i mean this whole year course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we had uh you you know all these we have all these uh uh somebody said you know you're either a stranger or a fool if you try to predict Texas weather but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we had all these people saying it was gonna be the hottest summer ever you know and we had all this rain and it really is not a bad summer at all really cool but all of a sudden in in um in October
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		um September October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time
 		then uh then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping just pouring down you know and flash floods everywhere and that kind of deal
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then uh uh end of November the first like the second week um you know the first week actually we had we had a freeze
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and the average you know the average uh first frost is like the fifteenth of November here but usually it's not until later it's really strange
 	
 	
 		oh if you had it early
 		yeah i think we usually have a frost in October
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		but you know we really need the rain that we've been getting and it has not today but the last few days it's been been pouring most of the day
 	
 	
 		is it is it is it flooding anywhere
 	
 	
 		is it flooding anywhere i have not heard of it any problems of it flooding anywhere i mean that's occurred certainly at times in the past but uh no i've not heard of any particular problems this time
 	
 	
 		it just kind of uh cloud we're supposed to to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here uh which will be you know a little bit more typical uh autumn weather
 		but really it's strange we haven't really had an autumn it's like we went into winter without you know the the poor trees said what  what's that
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah yeah yeah we had we had uh summer lasting long and then it then it then it became winter like
 	
 	
 		yeah uh uh and
 	
 	
 		uh today it's today it's it's sort of change it's warmer to sort of more typical autumn day
 	
 	
 		yeah there you you know usually there's uh i have a a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and you know all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine you know it's that same trees pines and and hard woods you know hickories and oaks and stuff and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was up there last weekend and there are trees that that still have their leaves on and they're green but they're dead
 		you know the freeze the freeze just got them they they weren't ready for it at all apparently and and we haven't had a typical fall at all no not much color and you know changes have a color at all
 	
 	
 		guess not
 	
 	
 		really weird this year
 		i'm not sure what that what that means
 	
 	
 		i don't know yeah our leaves are are all on the on the ground now i think it was a especially good winter for fall colors
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you you all actually had some color huh  it kind of crept in and
 	
 	
 		the oh yeah yeah oh yeah we we did for a time
 	
 	
 		yeah it's usually beautiful up there isn't it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh gorgeous that's yeah i'd i'd say you could drive along in Maryland
 		and and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the and the pines and what not and and you could you know you could be driving along East Texas and it looks just the same it's almost you know identical identical kind of country
 	
 	
 		um-hum but not this year for the trees for the leaves
 	
 	
 		beautiful yeah oh really
 		yeah i was up i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend  yeah
 		pull little oak tree that was dead and
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		cut it up and split it  it was kind of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah this is because it it can't tolerate a freeze this early is that right
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		if it would came later it'd be all right
 	
 	
 		uh it it there's some trees like the oaks like a white oak seem to be pretty hearty that nothing bothers them their leaves are still green
 		and some of the other oaks there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves um what i notice mostly is the red maples
 		the the leaves are just dead the dogwoods look still look you know they got uh bit on the ends of leaf a little bit but they still look pretty good
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it just depends on the on the uh on the tree
