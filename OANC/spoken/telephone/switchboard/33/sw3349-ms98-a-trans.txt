 		that's correct what are your hobbies
 	
 	
 		well i i kind of have hobby fads i guess when i was growing up i was was into coin collecting and that dropped off about the time i hit puberty i guess and then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my hobbies in high school went just to the sports
 		now my latest one's is is classic cars i've
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i had a sixty six Mustang that i was rebuilding but i almost had it done and i went on went ahead and sold it
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		but it was fun i really enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		now how'd you learn to do that
 	
 	
 		oh you just
 	
 	
 		to fix them up you just get a a book that tells you how to do it or what
 	
 	
 		no you just kind of all i did was uh i bought the car and then uh
 		you know you can i uh
 		was just in a supermarket and i seen a a magazine for
 		you know basically it was it was called Mustang Magazine and and so i bought it and they had uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		some names some companies that sold mustang parts and i just started ordering some parts and and you know basically you know i what i did was
 		i redid the whole interior i didn't do too much to the engine because the engine was pretty good but the the whole interior and then part of the exterior just kind of do it
 	
 	
 		where'd you get the car
 	
 	
 		well we lived we lived in South Dakota and i bought it up there before i moved down here
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so it was it was kind of rusted out there isn't too much rust on any vehicles down here
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 		that's true
 		well that sounds neat
 	
 	
 		well gee i guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies that that about covers mine and T-shirt making about covers yours
 	
 	
 		let's see
 		well let's see i've done other hobbies i'm a hobby person i've always done a lot of craft stuff i always have done needle point and cross stitch and all that and
 		i collect dolls i have a huge collection of dolls which is still in New Mexico with my parents uh-huh i'm from New Mexico
 	
 	
 		in New Mexico
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so
 		let's see what else i started collecting music boxes i guess that's a hobby
 	
 	
 		whoa
 		yeah that is that's interesting how many music boxes do you have
 	
 	
 		so
 		probably uh uh about twenty
 	
 	
 		do they all play different songs or do some of them play the same song
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		they they all play different songs
 	
 	
 		well that's neat what's the most expensive one you bought
 	
 	
 		the most expensive i don't know i've gotten all of them for gifts i don't i've probably only bought a few of them i usually get them for Christmas gifts or
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and like when people go you know to on trips or something
 	
 	
 		well that that's interesting it used to be teaspoons was the thing
 	
 	
 		so that's pretty neat
 		that's true  i've never collected those
 		never collected those
 	
 	
 		yeah that's interesting music boxes
 	
 	
 		i have dolls from all over too that i started when i was a little girl and i have a lot of dolls people would always bring them when they'd go to the countries and
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		um and i did that when i went to Europe one summer i bought a doll everywhere we went so
 	
 	
 		well how was Europe
 	
 	
 		it's about to come to me it was great it was quick i was in the it was in high school it was in a tour and we went all it's kind of a
 		it's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries and um it's called People to People and we'd stay in people's homes and then we got to also tour big cities and i really enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		was that in high school or was that a college thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it was in high school
 		so i'd like to go back because we had you know everything was rushed everything we had like an hour or two hours at the louvre you know  things like that where you need the whole day but
 	
 	
 		i bet
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it really
 	
 	
 		right that's where a a camcorder would come in handy
 	
 	
 		exactly that's true
 	
 	
 		well well that sounds real neat
 	
 	
 		now let's see
 	
 	
 		so you you haven't been back to Europe since though huh
