 
     		
 	
 		i um think that's one of the greatest concerns that uh is in our nation today is the crime problem
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what do you think
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well yeah there's a host a lot of things that center around that crime area uh you know from
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		from just uh people trying to make a living on the wrong side of the law to those who are just trying to uh keep their drug habit up and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i think that it encompasses a whole lot of the concerns
 	
 	
 		i know in the large cities uh um we think that we have more crime but
 		we have a place out in the country and uh we've had more  more people break into our place in the country than we have in town
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and so i don't know that it's confined just to the large cities
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh we found that
 		the crime rate in the country increased when they had let loose some uh early parolees
 		and uh that concerned me because i was hoping letting the people out of prison early on for good behavior would work but i about decided it didn't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		yeah i i just don't know what kind of criteria they have used for most of those early parole leases releases so uh
 	
 	
 		i think sometimes it it depends on what space they need
 	
 	
 		that's right i think you're right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm sure it has a lot to do with it
 	
 	
 		do you think that that has as much to do with the rising crime rate as uh the uh beginning of the of the gangs and things
 	
 	
 		well i think um
 		certainly that might have something to do with it but i also think that
 		the standards of uh what we consider normal are is drastically changing each generation at least if not faster by because of the movies that are out there
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and what all the kids are exposed to and also the grown-ups out there that we're just constantly watching and
 		what we would of normally you know used to consider awful is almost a normal kind of thing on TV now and
 	
 	
 		i see what you mean
 	
 	
 		yeah and i so i think that it's uh and also i think uh
 		the way our lives our families are are uh being raised that with a lot more single families or a lot more full-time working families that uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there are a lot more strangers out there taking care of our kids and i i mean strangers in the sense of not the close family knit types that they used to have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i felt so i think there's a lot more people growing up confused and feeling not really considering uh you know necessarily as wanted or loved as they might have felt
 		uh had the family been a little closer-knit
 	
 	
 		um-hum or maybe don't feel as responsible to anyone for their actions
 	
 	
 		that's that's right that's a good good way to say uh to say it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well do you think that uh with the recession that everyone says is coming along and more women don't find work and have to stay home and the economy goes down do you think that would help
 		um deter the crime raise and and increase raising of families
 	
 	
 		well i think it would be a long term change i don't think that we will see it too soon i think it'll
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		not change i don't think it will slow down for quite some time just because there's you know it's gonna take that pendulum a long time to swing back the other way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i see an awful lot of working parents who very very involved in their children
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i don't know i know it's hard especially to monitor television if you're not around
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i think there are definitely are ways that both parents can work and have recent you know responsible and and you know very loving children growing up and staying that way
 		but i think it takes the effort and extra time and effort out of those parents and not too many not as many people are doing that as they should because we're used to having an easy get it when you want it society and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know uh the easy way out is considered more appropriate sometimes than than the working hard methods that  used to be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i have a friend who's a principal in school and she said that a lot of the parents that she calls they just flat don't wanna be bothered
 	
 	
 		so
 		right i think we're all tired and having too many pressures and i just occurred when you mentioned principal it occurred to me when i was teaching how
 		um it was becoming quite disturbing realizing how many crack babies were there were becoming you know out there in the educational area and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the things that we'll be dealing with just on the educational front that
 		um are people that will children that will eventually grow to be older possible crime makers themselves because they started out in life with having so many you know uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
