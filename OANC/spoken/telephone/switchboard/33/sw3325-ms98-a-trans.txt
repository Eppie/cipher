 
     		
 	
 		okay well do you have a pet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i have two cats
 	
 	
 		two cats you're lucky
 	
 	
 		and do and oh and two fish
 	
 	
 		you have two fish
 	
 	
 		and what do you have
 	
 	
 		well uh my husband you know how sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		my husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog so we have a black Labrador
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		beautiful gorgeous black Labrador but to me he belongs up in the field you know in the ranch in the farm and
 	
 	
 		right
 		does he sleep in your house
 	
 	
 		well  because we finally negotiated that i was losing my mind um he sleeps in the laundry room and then he goes out for the day but this this is a beautiful dog and he is wonderful with our little girls and he is
 		he's comes from a purebred line and there's nothing you could say bad about him except that i was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and this is huge you know of course when he runs around the yard he just digs he doesn't know that he's tearing up things but he does
 	
 	
 		yeah yep
 	
 	
 		and the worst part that i had with him he's he's three now was when he was uh about eight months old and i did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while i was gone for about an hour and i came home and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		and it was in the floor
 		and i just about lost it and i called and said come home and get your dog
 		and so he said well puppies just chew when they're nervous and well i wish you had told me you know and it was about eight months later he ate a piece of a linoleum he kept picking at it and i didn't know the the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		so the last thing he did was when i had set out a whole lot of begonias in the back yard and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i told my husband i said you know it's either me or the dog and he looked at me like well you know so he loves this dog and every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him and he's a good dog
 	
 	
 		good bye
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it's one of those things i'm just having to get used to and that's why i laughed when they called it the topic i thought oh boy do i have a pet
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but i i grew up with cats and i'm very comfortable yeah
 	
 	
 		i love my cats i had one cat for eighteen years i got her when i lived in Hawaii
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		before i even got married i had my cat
 	
 	
 		she's old isn't she oh i started to say then you broke your heart
 	
 	
 		well she i had to have her put to sleep last June
 		oh it was awful it was just awful but and she just sat there on my lap you know she just just waited and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		bless your heart that makes me feel so bad
 	
 	
 		oh it was awful but her hair but the bad thing was though she would pee in my husband's shoes you know and she just liked his shoes and he'd have to dress hundred dollar shoes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh no
 		
 
 		oh
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		oh it's just bad and my closet and it was oh so sick
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's awful i've never heard of that before
 	
 	
 		it oh it's just terrible and once she did it you know then she would i mean she wouldn't if our shoes sat side by side she would pee in my husband's shoes she must have known he didn't like her or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		or the smell or something
 	
 	
 		oh anyway i've i've and i would shut i would bar the closet doors and i would carpet carpet vacuum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh clean the carpets and oh dear it was just awful that was very funny
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well does now does your cat sleep in the house they are they're house cats
 	
 	
 		i uh well i have two cats right now and of course they sleep with my kids my kids my my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah good
 		oh but the cat doesn't destruct does it see it doesn't do anything
 	
 	
 		oh no i won't i'm not gonna have a dog we've had two dogs
 	
 	
 		see
 	
 	
 		and um they both got ran over after we've had them for several years just nice little outside dogs but
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		were just my kids' friends they would go jogging i they would go with me when i would go running and and the last one got hit um as she was following my one of my sons across the road to the school
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh no oh that is
 	
 	
 		it was awful it was just and it just it's too heartbreaking but they do dig up and they just they just wreck things and i'm not a dog person

 		ooh
 		i wouldn't want a lab it sounds beautiful but but

 		um
 	
 	
 		and i brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there and he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square and he's just huddled up like if you'll be nice to me i won't make any trouble you know again and then my daughters both have hamsters
