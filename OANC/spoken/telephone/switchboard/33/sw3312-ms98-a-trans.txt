 
     		
 	
 		kind of options do you have in your work
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh as far as other than salary like the fringe benefits um  we get of course insurance paid  we get our sick leave and and holidays paid
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's nice
 	
 	
 		uh earn vacation and uh of course the work place is is uh very
 		uh it's a very nice area to work in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um how about you
 	
 	
 		well we don't get much
 	
 	
 		you don't
 	
 	
 		no we don't um we have to pay for our own insurance
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we you know we do get the vacation but we don't get sick pay until we've been there a year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then um i think it starts after four days
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you've been gone five consecutive days then you get one day of sick pay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		um it's real tough
 	
 	
 		the
 	
 	
 		for benefits
 	
 	
 		the sick leave is according according to the status the way you're employed it has something to with the the way you earn your sick leave and uh you don't automatically get it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		depends on your status
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but uh really can't complain course the cost of uh living keeps going up salaries remain about the same and your medical benefits go up also
 	
 	
 		that's the truth
 		uh-huh if you can get some good medical benefits it makes a big difference
 	
 	
 		it it surely does especially if you have a family
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't but i know when you have children
 	
 	
 		and you don't
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it can get to be quite expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't have any children but i do have my husband gets um insurance paid through his company
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it's still cheaper for me to pay for mine through my job than it is to get onto his
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		gee i i didn't realize that
 	
 	
 		so
 		until he's been there a little longer then maybe i can you know get into that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but a little better but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right now
 	
 	
 		well do you think then salary is the most important
 	
 	
 		no i really don't i really think that benefits
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um help out a lot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know with the positions um
 		uh benefits you know like you said are are almost better you know that's a lot of pay
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		if you thought if you think about health because i think my husband and i went to um get health insurance from an outside agency once
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it would cost just me alone two hundred dollars a month
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		to get basic health insurance and if you think about that on top of your pay it makes a big difference
 	
 	
 		i know that my parents recently retired well not recently maybe the last six eight years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they had to uh buy a policy until
 		something kicked in at a certain age and they were paying an enormous amount of money per month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it is unbelievable
 	
 	
 		in order to maintain it really is
 	
 	
 		and then my mom and dad have that Blue Blue Cross Blue Shield and i think that goes up every month
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that is just something else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because they're you know at the retirement age and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that's something too that's just unbelievable
 	
 	
 		i know some of the companies when you do retire you're able to carry forward your retire your insurance benefits
 	
 	
 		oh well that would be great
 	
 	
 		wouldn't that be wonderful
 	
 	
 		that would be nice  yes it would
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh i don't know i don't know what else would there be besides your insurance and your holiday paid and
 	
 	
 		yeah my my husband gets uh life insurance dental insurance and um
 		life and dental and and health
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then he also gets legal help legal aid
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he also gets like he's entered into a credit union and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah we have that
 	
 	
 		and and all that that kind of helps out
 	
 	
 		uh now that's true now we've started the EA where you can um if you have like a mental health problem
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a drug problem or what have you
 		uh mentally they they will provide services for that now too and that's wonderful uh
 	
 	
 		well that's nice
 		um-hum
 		my my sister where she works has the HMO
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is something that's
 		you know it's nice but you know it's great because you pay five dollars and you go
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and your medicine is five dollars but if it's not an emergency you wait three months
 	
 	
 		is that right well
 	
 	
 		to get in
 		um-hum that is um
 		trying to think which one that is but i'm not it's a real popular one
 	
 	
 		hum is it like Cigna or
 	
 	
 		but um
 		Kaiser Kaiser
 	
 	
 		Kaiser
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well we have that option at at work uh to choose that or to stay with our our company
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that uh TI has desired to administer the insurance program
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh you can either go with the HMO or stay with with Aetna
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i i'm going with Aetna
 	
 	
 		that's what i'm i'm staying with
 	
 	
 		well i'm just going to stay with the um you know i can go to my doctor i think i pay two hundred and fifty dollar deductible and that's it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but yeah because she you know was trying to get into like an eye doctor or something like that and if it's not an emergency you wait for quite a while to get in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well see now your eye doctor's paid for through the HMO
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		ours isn't
 		well i don't know about the HMO but through Aetna it is not covered no
 	
 	
 		it's not yeah my isn't either but through the HMO it is
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		and i think eyes and and about every doctor you could about
