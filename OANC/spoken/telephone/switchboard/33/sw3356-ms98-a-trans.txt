 
     		
 	
 		um we our subject is golf
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and that's a good subject that i like to talk about
 	
 	
 		well good because i thought my goodness i'm i'm a definitely a beginner at golf
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh are you do you play
 	
 	
 		um i took lessons a couple of not last spring but spring before last and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i really enjoyed it and i had taken years ago and i never could see that what i was doing was
 		causing that little ball to do anything and so um but when went i took this time you know it actually went up in the air and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i i mean i could see that what i was doing made a difference and so um my husband and i uh took together he had played some
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		already and then we started playing some and and we played in the summer a few times and then i teach and i don't have time to during the school year much but um
 	
 	
 		oh that's the way to do it yeah
 		um-hum
 		right well you got weekends
 	
 	
 		well it just seems like it just is all a it really does and then uh and in the spring we've we've been lucky enough to go to several of those tournaments around here the uh
 	
 	
 		it takes a lot of time yeah it does
 	
 	
 		one at Las Colinas and uh the Byron Byron Nelson and i've loved watching so i'm i'm definitely a good spectator for not so much on TV but you know for live
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		well i even i enjoy it on TV uh it once you get into it a little more you'll enjoy it on TV also
 	
 	
 		well now you know actually i have occasionally occasionally watched a little of it and i never did ever before i took these lessons my my son uh plays golf and he's oh he loves to watch it on TV so i guess if you play a lot you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yes the more you get into it you you'll really enjoy it on TV too i think or or everybody i know that does
 	
 	
 		right well how about well well what about you
 	
 	
 		yeah i play all the time well not all the time but i try to get in at least
 		we play where there's a little course go down East Texas and we go down there a lot in Mount Vernon
 	
 	
 		where is that
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		that is that very far
 	
 	
 		no it's a hundred miles i'm originally from there and we go down nearly every weekend my folks live there so we have a place to stay and uh it's it's just so much fun when you got a regular group of your buddies you play with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so that's what i do and the wife took it up about two or three years ago and she's she's enjoyed it a lot but it's hard to get the girls to play you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it is
 	
 	
 		and uh so she doesn't really get to play you know enough enough not nearly enough although what she does she and i'll play sometimes you know and and she enjoys it but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and she enjoys playing with the girls but heck most of the time they're not all playing you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and course i've got a group that i play with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it makes it a little bit difficult there but we enjoy it it's a lot of fun and uh one of the best parts about it once she took it up was when we'd go on a little
 		trip somewhere not long trips or anything but just little trips you know well it was always real good to  to take our clubs and she could we could play golf
 	
 	
 		oh i know i think that's that's great
 	
 	
 		whereas before i probably wouldn't even get to play you know and now she enjoys playing with me and and we you know it it just makes the trips more enjoyable for me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		so uh how long have you been playing
 	
 	
 		oh i've been playing probably twenty years or longer i didn't start it nearly as young as i should have i think i was about
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		twenty uh i don't know i guess i've been playing longer than that since i'm fifty i've probably been playing uh twenty five years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well um that i mean that's what they all say is that you know that's one of those things that you just can't start young enough
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh well you most  well you think you'd be better if you started early i'm not so sure that's true i see
 	
 	
 		especially i guess if you you start early and you just get get good lessons and you do it right i guess and
 	
 	
 		yeah some some people
 		that helps but then some people are just good at it and some are not
 	
 	
 		i i guess so it really is interesting
 	
 	
 		uh now now you're gonna improve and it helps to take lessons and and play a lot you're going definitely gonna get better but i'm talking about the difference from being a
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh mid nineties to low uh high i mean a low nineties to a mid eighties shooter which that's what i am to being a guy that shoots in the low seventies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh my well you're doing real well
 	
 	
 		that doesn't sound like a lot of difference but believe me it's a lot of difference
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it really is
 	
 	
 		well um uh did and so do you play around here some
 	
 	
 		i used to play around here all the time but i don't any more since we just i just play down there now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh where would you play here
 	
 	
 		uh my favorite courses around here are uh Fire Wheel
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i i like Chase Oaks real well but it's kind of expensive
 	
 	
 		oh so is Fire Wheel not as expensive
 	
 	
 		no it's a it's a municipal course Garland owns it
 		city of Garland owns and that's how
 	
 	
 		oh well i i  course have you ever played at Plano
 	
 	
 		oh yeah Plano's a good course i've played there oh gosh ever since it's been there many many times
 	
 	
 		well well is it competitive well we've played that's where we've played mostly we've played at Chase Oaks too but um
 	
 	
 		it's an excellent golf course
 		Chase Oaks is difficult you really need to be a good golfer to play Chase Oaks
 	
 	
 		oh horrors i mean we just lose jillions of balls and
 	
 	
 		yeah if you're not a really good golfer don't waste your time at at Chase Oaks yeah it's too
 	
 	
 		that's discouraging isn't it
