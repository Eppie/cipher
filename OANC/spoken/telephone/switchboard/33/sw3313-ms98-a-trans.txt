 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Jeri we're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done about it
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's a rather rather broad topic
 	
 	
 		they're usually pretty broad anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where do you live
 	
 	
 		uh we live in Plano um and where are you
 	
 	
 		okay so  i'm in Richardson so when i heard the topic i was thinking of the thing down at um Maceo High School in Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right that is so frightening
 	
 	
 		it is you know
 	
 	
 		um do you have children in school yeah
 	
 	
 		no mine are already in college now so uh i don't have to
 		at least when they were in high school it was beginning but not like the rampages
 	
 	
 		well i have my oldest is his first year in high school so we have all this to to look forward to and it is really frightening um to think that you can't even
 		send them to school in safety i mean certainly you know you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas but you know  when you can't even send them on their normal
 		activities in safety it it's really frightening
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh  i really you know they're coming down on the principal but i really don't know
 		what they can do i mean it's just in so much of society
 		with the violence and the kids having access to weapons and drugs and i i really don't know what what can be done
 	
 	
 		yeah well i just i just don't understand how of course in my little world how guns could be so available
 	
 	
 		well  i don't either but apparently they just really are um
 		i mean you to me in Plano you would think that would be about you know about as innocent as you could get for for being in a a large
 		area but you know my son comes home and tells me that you know he hears kids talk about having guns and um someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun
 	
 	
 		oh my heavens
 	
 	
 		and i mean it just scared me to death and you know they called the police and and nothing happened but my goodness you know it it could have easily
 	
 	
 		well maybe that's the answer to crime is getting  more prosecution
 	
 	
 		maybe so
 	
 	
 		you know because
 		i don't now i somehow i feel we're living in an impartial society
 		as far as people seeing something happen you know across the street or
 		seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped and people don't do anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a woman was raped in Richardson i read in the paper oh about a two weeks ago now and all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		but nobody nobody did anything
 	
 	
 		i just can't imagine that um
 	
 	
 		you know i mean they heard someone calling for help
 		nobody even called the police to say you know i hear a strange screaming
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i'm afraid you know if you i don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves because
 	
 	
 		right well i can see you know especially even if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because you know it could be dangerous but certainly i can't understand not calling the police
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		i just you know it's
 		it's really  frightening that we're not we're trying to live in our own little cocoons and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention
 	
 	
 		right well i i think you're right there i guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business but i think that's real dangerous and uh
 		i don't know i try tell my kids just just kind of be aware of what's around them you know and
 		if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble just get out of it or call for help whichever but um
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah well you know the call for help is what scares me now because
 		it it just i don't know people just don't i don't know i can't say they don't care because people just have to care about another person
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's that not getting involved that impersonal
 		society i think we live in today
 	
 	
 		well maybe this thing with with the child at school maybe that'll  make people think a bit more and
 		you know take some steps to to correct it i don't know it's it really is is frightening i uh
 	
 	
 		yeah let me ask you getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of bothers me that police aren't doing he didn't have a license for the gun correct
 	
 	
 		i don't know i mean i don't know the details this was not a child that was on the team it was someone that
 		um showed you know just kind of showed up at the field
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um it was a a student age person but i'm not even
