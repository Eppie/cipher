 
     		
 	
 		okay do you work
 	
 	
 		yes i do
 	
 	
 		i think that's the main change what do you think
 	
 	
 		well i think that's a big part of it and i i think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home and i almost think with our society and and inflation and the cost of things it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home
 	
 	
 		one right
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but but yeah i think that's a big change  i'd like to not work what about you
 	
 	
 		well i've worked all the time up until just about a year ago
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i just uh physically i wasn't able to and i mean i love my job but i have four children and that's real hard you have children i assume so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes i have two and that's been a big deciding factor because
 		i mean i never wanted to be a career woman but as long as i was was you know was going to work i was going to do as as much as i could as well as i could etcetera and
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		i i wanted to stay home when i had kids well i have two i have a four year old and a three year old and we would like two more but i it's like we talked uh i don't want two more unless i can quit and stay home and take care of them which is something right now financially it takes both people to work
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right oh
 		it's real hard it's real hard i mean even i
 	
 	
 		yeah it's full time work
 	
 	
 		yeah it was so hard for me to work full time course my kids are are a little older but then you then you give up the money you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah you do there's saying course you know everything you give up something but i just i the kids are so wonderful  but i do think that's one of the major changes you know my mom i remember her being home
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 		yep
 	
 	
 		uh you know she made breakfast in the morning for us and if she worked it was part time and it was work that was done while we were at maybe at school and she was there when we got home you know and
 	
 	
 		fine
 		yep i know
 		yeah well i've decided now in fact i'm just i'm substitute teachers aid which is a a far cry from my travel agent career you which i loved
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i'm i'm there in the same school as my children my two littler ones
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm home when they're home in fact i've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store
 		and i'm just really hesitating because i've i enjoyed my the first summer home ever spent seventeen years with my kids
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i mean where i didn't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent
 		and it was wonderful my kids and i we just had a ball course their their ages they're seventeen almost seventeen fifteen almost well sixteen fourteen eleven and nine and we're just running every direction and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		see and i think
 		oh
 		oh
 		but see it's such an important time to be home
 	
 	
 		it is yes
 	
 	
 		you know and that was important to me an that's my you know my husband was raised uh his his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked and he's like well you know what's the big deal about being home for your kids
 	
 	
 		always were
 		what yeah
 	
 	
 		well as our kids are getting older you know he sees it more i said Russ you don't understand what it was like to have her home or to if you needed mom at school you know she was there to help or she was there to take you and you and and i want to be able to do those things so
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		i think that you know it's good you know sometimes i'll have the cookies ready when they come home and and a lot of my boys uh my older boys' junior high friends will come over in fact everyday i've got boys hanging around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's wonderful  i'm real close to the schools and you know we're just i i'm very happy to be staying home
 	
 	
 		i think that's wonderful  so where do you see us changing in the future
 	
 	
 		but again i miss the money
 		i don't i  working
 	
 	
 		well see that was one of the things she the the question i think is you know what changes do we see and i'm  i'm not sure i i see it going anywhere i think they're still gonna have to work
 	
 	
 		right
 		that we are because it's so expensive if we want the extra clothes the extra car the extra  thing is when a woman does work
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		then there's the clothes to buy and then there's the gas and then there's the lunches and then the day care you must pay a fortune in day care yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		the day care eats me alive
 		you know i pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty a month for two kids  they'd eat you alive
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		yeah for two it's almost hardly worth it for you to work till they get in school then you work summers unless you're a teacher are you a teacher
 	
 	
 		i know
 		you no i'm not and i would love you you you talked about having the summers off and i thought oh that would be so wonderful and i love the little preschool they are in it's wonderful you know so i feel good about them being there but it's still not the same
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 		um-hum
 		no it's not the same
 	
 	
 		it's just not
 	
 	
 		i i don't see things changing really and and it's terrible for divorced women
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education thank goodness i have mine and i could get a real good paying job if i wanted to you know do in fact i still have offers you know please come back and we'll pay you this
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm please come back to work sure
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and it's been a real tough decision but i'm very happy to be here with my kids my kids we've seen a remarkable difference in now that i'm home
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm real and i'm but i've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis  yeah yeah i know
 	
 	
 		well i like that
 		well we're working on it i'm hoping in about three to five years i'll be able to stay home and my kids of course will be in school then but i'll be there mornings i'll be there noons i'll be there afternoons and all i feel like that's good and i can work part days in my husband's business you know so that
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah well
 		oh that'd be great right i think the the other thing that that has changed for women because we are working is we're having less children
 	
 	
 		he can afford for us to do that you know
