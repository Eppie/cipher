 
     		
 	
 		there okay i hope we've done it right uh we're supposed to talk about music
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		okay
 		oh well that's good because i'm a singer
 	
 	
 		well good what kind of singer are you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um in high school and college it was classical lately it's been more contemporary country
 	
 	
 		oh really do you do you sing in a group or
 	
 	
 		well
 		no actually i do what's called karaoke um the
 	
 	
 		oh tell me what that is
 	
 	
 		it's a a thing where you've got a background video that just has the background music the instrumentals and there the video has the words to the songs on it and you can sing along with the with the tape
 		it's pretty neat they do it at a lot of different clubs
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um like Dave and Buster's and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh little country bars and stuff
 	
 	
 		and and so you stand up in front of the
 	
 	
 		you get up in a front of the audience and a microphone
 	
 	
 		and and where and uh are you looking at the words
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah they've got a little TV monitor on the stage most most places do
 	
 	
 		so so who sees it do you just see it
 	
 	
 		um the person singing sees the monitor and most places have a big screen behind you so that everybody can see the words yeah
 	
 	
 		so that everybody sees it
 		do they sing along
 	
 	
 		uh not usually unless it's a real ratty song  it's it's fun
 	
 	
 		well how cute so that way that keeps them from being able to have other uh have or other musicians
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh yeah it's you some of the places do karaoke like once or twice a week and then they have like there's a a country bar or country saloon i used to go to that they have uh country bands most of the rest of the week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's it's pretty neat i like it
 	
 	
 		well that and and you and so you get up and sing it yourself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		well great
 	
 	
 		i i i had a a music scholarship to college but i didn't use it  so what do you do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i am a music teacher  i teach uh elementary music in Plano and
 	
 	
 		oh how neat
 		oh i don't know about elementary  i don't know i think elementary would be good  that would be interesting with the little kids
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well
 		it it it it has a lot of uh very  um  rewarding parts and then the there are lots of it that you know you feel like you're just a bouncer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh yeah i i i can remember music back then
 	
 	
 		and then the paperwork and all of that but generally where i am i
 		um i uh this has been the the best situation in terms of not having a lots of discipline problems and and having children that really are pretty interested in in music in general
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so it's really been nice but
 	
 	
 		i think that's one reason i got out of music because i didn't think i wanted to go into teaching and at at that point it was either performing or teaching it was like oh well
 	
 	
 		well it and
 		yeah it it's and i think that's a real valid reason for not majoring in it my boys
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		were good in it and  they didn't even even i mean that was the reason they they took a lot of it in college but they didn't go on with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i after college i got out got married started working or started working got married and i didn't sing for ten years and i just found karaoke last October i guess
 		and i was just thrilled i loved it it's it's neat
 	
 	
 		now you didn't you didn't sing in uh uh  during those ten years you didn't sing at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um not really not in not in anything not in anything organized no
 	
 	
 		not even like in church choir
 	
 	
 		it periodically if we go to like
 		a Christmas Eve services where they do the part of Messiah or something like that but that was about it but back in high school i was more of a classical kind of stuff through Wagner and Chopin and and Schubert and
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah things that they they have you do during high school
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah the things you have to do for competition
 	
 	
 		well what is what is your um
 		uh what is your voice is it alto or
 	
 	
 		um in high school i was from second soprano down to tenor believe it or not  i i sang tenor a lot in church
 	
 	
 		my goodness  i kind of wondered
 		i kind of wondered if your voice if you uh  might be you know old usually country singers uh or folksingers have lower voices that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		they yeah that's i found a lot of stuff like Anne Murray she i have to that's one thing neat about karaoke you can change pitches i mean you can change the keys
 	
 	
 		uh-huh ooh
 		really
 	
 	
 		and her stuff i normally have to take up at least a step if not a step and a half
 	
 	
 		well is that a bad uh oh they're probably i wonder if that means they've cut us off
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		heard a little
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i i can't remember i've only done this one other time
 	
 	
 		oh  good i don't feel bad
 	
 	
 		are you doing this uh as a fund-raiser
 	
 	
 		no my i'm in a sorority but we decided not to do it for the sorority my boss his wife is one of the uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the sorority the transcribers for the tapes and he was like do you wanna make some money okay here  so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		my it's an easy way to do it well we're doing it in our church choir
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 		oh now that's a neat idea
 	
 	
 		and it's supposed to you know be a
 		a really i mean they a lot of they've already made a lot of money on it
 	
 	
 		that's
 		wow now that that would be a good idea yeah i proposed it for the uh for i'm in a service or actually it's a social sorority and it's Beta Sigma Phi
 	
 	
 		so isn't that
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they decided no that we wouldn't not everybody might be able to make all the calls so i was like okay that's fine i'll do it for myself
 	
 	
 		well i just decided i would do it once  try to do it once a night and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i i mean i just started doing it this week but uh  the first time we had to talk on exercise and then this time music so
 	
 	
 		um boy
