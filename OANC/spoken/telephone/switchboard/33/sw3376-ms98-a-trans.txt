 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		right now what was your name again
 	
 	
 		okay well well my name's Barry where do you golf at
 	
 	
 		Barry okay
 		well i don't uh much well actually hardly at all i um the only times that i've actually golfed is we we were uh going to a family reunion up in Maine every year
 		and a bunch of the brother-in-laws and whatever else would go out and play like couple times during the week that we were all there um
 		i've done that about three or four times i guess
 	
 	
 		i see so you're from Maine originally then
 	
 	
 		no i'm from uh uh New York
 	
 	
 		New York
 	
 	
 		but we've got my family my family my dad's family's from Maine
 	
 	
 		well i'm originally from Nebraska and really didn't play much golf there until i moved to South Dakota and we lived on the golf course and i took up uh golf at that time and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		really enjoyed it and uh then when we moved to Plano
 		i really haven't had uh we've lived here a year now and i really haven't uh golfed a lot but those times that i have been out i went to the uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh Plano Municipal Golf Course and then i've golfed uh couple times uh at Chase Oaks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's very challenging at Chase Oaks uh lot of water
 	
 	
 		what's it cost to to play at at now
 	
 	
 		oh if i go to the Municipal Course it's uh maybe twenty five dollars for eighteen holes and uh seems to me that when i was at Chase Oaks uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well of course i took my son with me so we were close to you know fifty dollars or so
 	
 	
 		it's pretty expensive isn't it
 	
 	
 		it really is
 	
 	
 		yeah real expensive actually
 	
 	
 		but uh i enjoy it probably uh it depends on which day i go uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		as to which part is most challenging
 	
 	
 		um-hum what do you shoot what do you shoot when you were playing
 	
 	
 		oh probably uh for nine um i i i've felt pretty good with maybe a forty one forty two around in there
 	
 	
 		well that's not bad at all i that would make you about eighty or eighty two for for eighteen
 	
 	
 		that'd be a that'd be a darn good game for me yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but that's pretty that's pretty good shooting
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm happy with that
 	
 	
 		yeah well what do you what do you uh what do you find attractive about playing golf
 	
 	
 		well i think what i find attractive is when i can go out uh with friends and uh on a nice day just to be out uh and stay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		Jerry  hold on a second  Jerry she's about to get my cord
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		baby we got a loose connection on this phone
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh just uh i i guess the thing that i like most about it is getting away from work and uh a although uh if i am jogging or working out or playing golf or whatever it's a
 		a time to get away from things but yet sometimes things become more a little more clearer that way too
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i liked uh we i probably played maybe five or six times but we did that
 		and uh but what i liked about it was i could i could uh i liked being outside
 		um and of course the golf courses uh are are beautiful the one that we played at in Maine was real pretty and you could be with people and yet ooh ooh uh so you had nice you had company and stuff but then significant portions of the time you were off
 		in an area of the course by yourself too which uh it was kind of um  the best of both
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		both worlds actually
 	
 	
 		yeah that's nice i'm uh you know it it bothers me when uh especially in this particular area there are so many people that play golf that you tend to uh
 		you have a lot of people there and feel hurried and i don't i don't like to feel rushed when i'm playing golf
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		what's uh what's what do you do best on the golf course
 	
 	
 		but
 		oh you know it it really varies from day to day uh if i'm if i'm on i uh really can hit uh hit my driver pretty well
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and uh that's that's a new experience for me because for about a year to two years uh i couldn't hit my driver i had such a hook
 		that uh i would just use a three iron all the time and i could hit my three iron just about as far as anybody else could hit a driver so i used that but then i took a few lessons and really uh worked on it and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh you took lessons
 	
 	
 		uh yeah we had a golf pro uh and i took maybe two or three lessons basically uh and uh had a golf pro and and uh it was like maybe twenty five dollars for a half an hour
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh he really helped a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you own your own clubs i guess you probably do don't you
 	
 	
 		yep yeah i uh uh got a pair of used clubs for a Christmas present one year and uh so before that i'd been using uh
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		my little sister's uh women's set  and i thought boy the first day i got those uh new clubs i'd go out and uh really uh knock them dead and uh it takes a while to get used to a new set of clubs
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		hum
 		my uh brother plays a lot like every weekend
 		up in New Jersey
 	
 	
 		is he pretty good golfer
 	
 	
 		well you know yeah he shoots well he shoots eighties you know which which i think that's pretty good you know
 	
 	
 		good
 		we uh probably my the most exciting experience i had playing golf was over in Hawaii we took a vacation and uh my brother and i went out brother-in-law went out and uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		played in uh
