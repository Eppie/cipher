 
     		
 	
 		now then what is your idea on what to serve for a dinner party
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i don't know i i i personally don't throw a lot of dinner parties per se um
 	
 	
 		well if you were just gonna have company what would
 	
 	
 		um generally if i'm gonna have company something fairly easy for me to fix you know nobody wants to go to too much work um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		probably say it
 		you know if it's more than say four or five people probably a like a a a fish dish or something or or a a pasta
 		pasta dish
 	
 	
 		well what kind of pasta what pasta dishes  what is your specialty in pasta
 	
 	
 		um
 		generally uh the homemade pasta the wide whatever they call that stuff the wider homemade pastas
 	
 	
 		do you yeah do you make your own
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		ooh that must be interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah it uh it's fairly easy you just make the dough in the old Cuisinart and
 		roll it out and there's there's a we've got a special machine that you you roll it out and then it cuts it also and hang it over the drying rack
 	
 	
 		okay do you ever um since we're coming into the holiday season do you ever do desserts
 	
 	
 		um
 		actually about the only dessert i i generally fix is some form of pie or a buttermilk pound cake i  those the only kind of desserts i really like messing with anything anything more difficult than that is is
 		generally a pain to me i i just don't like to take that much time and stand around and do it
 	
 	
 		do you um do you care for the fruitcake
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		not at all
 	
 	
 		i i i can i i can stand about a piece a year one piece of it a year but i i don't like to just eat it it's
 	
 	
 		okay i have come upon a recipe several years ago that is the now i don't care for fruitcake period
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and this one is absolutely it's so easy and it is so wonderful everyone i serve it to that does not even care for fruitcake wants the recipe
 	
 	
 		uh  it's it's it's kind of funny i i don't think i've ever met anybody that actually likes fruitcake
 	
 	
 		oh my older daughter does oh she just thinks it's wonderful and we always provided her with with one but this is one can of Eagle Brand
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a pound of nuts a pound of cherries uh candied cherries and a pound of something else in the candied fruits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		mix that up put it in spray a pan loaf pan
 		pour it into the pan and cook it at two hundred and twenty five degrees
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for about about an hour and it's it is wonderful
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		that doesn't have all that citrine in it and i think that is what the uh people are so opposed to with with the fruitcake
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but maybe sometime when you have nothing better to do you would like to try that one
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what more need we talk about this morning
 	
 	
 		um i can't hardly think of much
 	
 	
 		have you enjoyed this um switchboard conversations or is this your first one
 	
 	
 		i've i've done several of them it's it's it's all right it's you know
 		it's not like anything anything disastrous or
 		you don't have to go to a lot of trouble to do it
