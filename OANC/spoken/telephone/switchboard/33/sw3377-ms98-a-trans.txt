 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i guess i've always kind of liked golf i i worked on a golf course at at one time and that's how i picked up golf
 		and uh
 		i don't know it's just a kind of a challenging game
 	
 	
 		it sure is i play at least three times a week
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm on it
 	
 	
 		i haven't gotten the chance lately though to play i'm trying to get back into it uh
 		so uh i got to start all over again it's not like riding a bicycle you do tend to forget
 	
 	
 		no
 		well i'm one of those rare left handed golfers
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i do enjoy playing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what's your handicap
 	
 	
 		right now it's three
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago it's probably up there to twenty now if if i was ever to start again
 	
 	
 		well if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i got to try and get out there i
 		i know with uh our long winters i i enjoy watching it i don't know if it's just because i like the game or i just like to to see the warm weather
 	
 	
 		uh well we can usually play here year round
 		sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but there's usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play and i'm pretty much addicted to golf so
 		i get out there one way or the other
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter you almost have to relearn every spring to
 		to get back out
 	
 	
 		it's a good game though it's very challenging and the reason i like it so much is because i'm
 		essentially playing against myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's the way i look at it i i play in in lot a lot of groups and but i don't
 		they keep score and
 		between themselves but i really don't care um i go out and each shot i say well this is what i'm gonna try to do and then i see how close i can come to that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		yeah you always work on trying to improve each day and
 	
 	
 		yeah and inevitably inevitably one facet facet of my game isn't working at one time or another either i'm not driving very well or i'm not hitting long irons very well or i'm not putting well or
 		but sometimes it all comes together
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i i know what you mean i when i used to golf out there i'd putt well but i i wouldn't uh chip well one of the two uh
 		or something would go wrong but
 		i always managed to to get near par anyway
 	
 	
 		well we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i went to that and Craig Statler won in the play-offs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but we uh this is a big golf area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we have a lot of uh
 		i'd say we probably have  within fifteen miles twenty golf communities built around courses that are
 		pretty well designed and then of course Pine Hurst and
 		we still have the Greensboro Open here every year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do you have uh long waits uh to get on the course
 	
 	
 		yes we do as a matter of fact it it uh it's only been that way in the last five years but now you uh most of the courses have a uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		two day advance tee time you have to call
 	
 	
 		yeah okay yeah
 		i just moved into this small community so i'm
 		gonna try and get in one of their golf courses here and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm hoping it won't be quite i was from the uh
 		twin cities area
 	
 	
 		that's some cold golf too isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather
 	
 	
 		we have cold
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		usually January and the first two weeks in February
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i wish that's all we had
 	
 	
 		but um last week we were in the seventies and
 		something's coming through now so it's like in the low forties right now
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties
 		we have very windy winters
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and very cold
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we don't get any snow anymore i don't i don't know what changed that pattern we used to get
 		four or five inches a year now we get nothing it's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall
 	
 	
 		oh i see well at least it that doesn't uh get in the way of golfing so
 	
 	
 		no but i have played golf in the snow before
 	
 	
 		that
 	
 	
 		yep get out my orange golf ball and go out and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		now that's what they do here sometimes you hear about it where they'll take the orange ball out there but
 		if you got
