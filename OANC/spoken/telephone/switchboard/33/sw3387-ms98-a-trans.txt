 
     		
 	
 		well i don't know what to do about the federal budget um there certainly been ideas surfaced uh recently um matter of fact repeatedly by many people and i sort of wonder what your what thoughts you had on that area
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what the uh the first one is we need people in there that that understand uh numbers and the numbers that are being thrown around when when we're talking in trillions of dollars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh  which is an astronomical sum and and the people that are talking these numbers  have no concept of what that number means
 		um
 	
 	
 		now are you are you talking about the elected people or are you talking about others um-hum
 	
 	
 		the elected people yes um-hum
 		our our our Senate and Congress and and people that that deal everyday and and what's going to be done with those monies
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um and don't really understand what that is or how a budget even works
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we need to elect people that are more
 		uh  or
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure how you would achieve how would you achieve that i mean if
 	
 	
 		well  let's let's make them have a degree in economy uh or economics
 	
 	
 		uh so you would trust the decision making  economists
 	
 	
 		you you
 		well
 	
 	
 		sometimes called the dismal science
 	
 	
 		yeah but but people people that that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um  when in in in the
 		the uh lobbyists needs to be eliminated
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh from Congress um
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		they don't make pragmatic decisions they make a decision based on constituency constituency
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		instead of a decision based on what they really believe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um you know the the  or or they tack on these uh pork bellies and and do things that that are good for their area to pass something that is that is not good for the country
 	
 	
 		right so so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists i mean right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say
 	
 	
 		oh i definitely i definitely would yeah get rid of them
 	
 	
 		love that make them all no causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for
 	
 	
 		totally uh
 		i i think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and be registered with what they ever contribute contribute but they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that that's a conflict of interest as far as i'm concerned
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when you're talking again uh billions and trillions of dollars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you're you're you're jeopardizing the future of the country uh for today
 		and that
 	
 	
 		so uh you talk about jeopardizing the future would you be against any deficit spending
 	
 	
 		i i think to bring it in line
 		you're going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line you can't ease into it it took years and years to build up the momentum that's there now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i i i forget the figures on the interest rate but it's something like uh hundreds of thousands of dollars a second
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in interest part of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves we we buy from intimate international banking that's why we have interest
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and i i really i really feel that that that is part of the problem
 		that we we've let things get so out of control that that we don't wanna put the brakes on them
 	
 	
 		but what what practical steps could one could one take um
 	
 	
 		by by having a a a budget that is is feasible that is reasonable
 	
 	
 		well but everybody will say that he is for that
 	
 	
 		oh of course yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and and and how will you make that actually happen
 	
 	
 		and then add on to it
 		you take the gross national income
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you say our budget is X number of percent of this gross national income one thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		across the board everyone no matter what pays a ten percent income tax
 	
 	
 		yep
 		sounds like a good idea
 		nothing escapes right no no deductions nothing just ten percent
 	
 	
 		uh
 		that's right
 		right no deductions you pay a ten percent income tax that's what you pay if you make forty million dollars uh then you're going to pay four million if if you make forty dollars you're going to pay four dollars
 	
 	
 		yep
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and that's it
 	
 	
 		yep so that that's it that's i mean i i agree with that that's a good idea idea and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or or lower them or what
 	
 	
 		and
 		i don't know that it  that it would or wouldn't
