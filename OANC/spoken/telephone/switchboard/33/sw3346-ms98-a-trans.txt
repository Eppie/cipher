 
     		
 	
 		okay you want to tell me first how you feel about
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well um i i just think the way that things are going that um that it would be good for young people to go ahead and have um dedicate themselves to at least something
 	
 	
 		the proposal
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i know like the Mormon religion you know they require two years of service uh missionary service uh right the boys
 	
 	
 		the boys
 		not the girl just the boys
 	
 	
 		yeah and um so but i think it would be good if for all young people you know to be able to to do something like that um so that um you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i i don't know i just feel it would be good for them to do that
 	
 	
 		um-hum i i thought it would be good too but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because not all young people would have uh what it takes to go like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i think it takes a certain person to to be able to do something like that but there's a lot of other public service things that could be done
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		oh yeah and and even in even in our home towns there's a lot of um public service things that they could do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know drug rehabilitation and and alcohol and and just uh helping old people and um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know helping cripple just helping somebody else and i think that art of giving is something that um we don't have very much any more
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i think it would be  when they say this proposal is this something that they're just suggesting or are they actually why why why did they call it a proposal that
 	
 	
 		oh i i think they just gave it a title but it's it's not something that's um in legislation or in works um uh yeah no no it's not it's just a just a topic but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		that's what i wondered what
 		it'd be a good character builder
 	
 	
 		i i think so too i think so too um because there's so many um kids who have uh you know so much money and so much free time and uh nothing to do um and and nothing to give their time to
 	
 	
 		huh
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um they don't even have a direction to give their their time to so i think it would be really good for people to um to be able to give their time in in uh some kind of public service uh even in our government
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know as uh aids to uh you know Congress uh people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um yeah it would be uh it'd be really good i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well people that are um
 		have received sentences in jail they have uh some of them are going out and doing uh they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is is good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 		oh yeah oh yeah i agree with you yeah this is something that um like you say it's it's character building um you know learning how to to give to others and being less selfish and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		well i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like you know what what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		um-hum um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		some of the people how they live or
 	
 	
 		oh i agree with you i agree with you and and i think uh young people are so um uh focused just on themselves and their activities and whose going out with whom et cetera that uh
 	
 	
 		you know
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know to get a taste of what the real world is actually about uh you know doing that that public service would be great yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah because that's one thing that's hard with young people you you can't tell them how things are they have to see for themselves and
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years i don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i would think so like right after um high school you know even even if it was like the the the their um that summer right after high school you know three months
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know they their teenage years and that they really sometimes need
 		a little better direction to go
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and something course now Peace Corps that couldn't be done of course until they were done with school
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		in such
 	
 	
 		you know something that was that was outside of uh outside of school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah but yeah you know right right after you graduate from uh high school because a lot of people are just um
 		uh well gee whiz what do i do now if if they're not focused on going to college and uh you know having that that uh gung ho plan uh that's you know setting their life goals
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		kind of an in between time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum yeah so to me see that would be the the uh the greatest time for um you know uh teenagers to to do that would be right after they graduated from high school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but as for it being required  you know we're we're just not we're not based on on on that uh type of a system um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh-uh
 		no and and like i said not now all young people should be able to do something but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		not all certainly would be geared to even the the Mormon boys that go out not all of them go i mean it's disaster if they don't go but  but some of them are not they're just not made to do that type of thing
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh right
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they just aren't able to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so um yeah it'd be good but like i said it requiring it would be uh
 	
 	
 		but
