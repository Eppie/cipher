 
     		
 	
 		the topic today is credit cards
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah bummer
 	
 	
 		uh why don't you go ahead and tell me some uh some of your favorite uses for a credit card if if at all that's applies
 	
 	
 		no because i don't have any
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i gave up all my credit cards when i got my first divorce
 		it's uh
 	
 	
 		well i wish i was in your shoes Pat i uh
 		i was i was i was in pretty much control of my credit cards up until the point where we moved down here from South Dakota and then uh
 		it took my wife and i about two months to find a job so in that interim everything went on the credit card
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh so now we're slowly trying to pay it off and
 		if i would i just keep thinking if i would've just been able to take that money and put it in a savings account instead of
 	
 	
 		paying bills
 	
 	
 		right i'd be uh you know i'd i'd be doing all right today but no i've got those darn credit card bills hanging over my head
 	
 	
 		yeah but that's still it still helps sometimes sometimes they help and sometimes they don't
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know i think if i had one i'd probably be maxed out
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that uh  that's uh always a possibility
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		because i'm not very what you call uh what's the word uh controllable
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		my husband is but i'm definitely not one of them people
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i uh while we were doing like i said we were doing all right you know we'd put gas occasionally go out to eat or pick up a small gift or something you know some clothes or something but and we could always pay it off when
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when the bill came and when we moved down here and everything was going on the credit card i think we we got a little rampant we you know went out to eat out everything and
 		you know we'd we'd have to go to Wet and Wild and we had to basically play tourists the first
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		the first month that we were here and
 		of course everybody takes credit cards so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		why not
 	
 	
 		it got uh it got way out of hand but
 		thankfully we're we're now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		working to pay them off and and we haven't put anything on them in a couple months
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		it gets bad
 	
 	
 		it can it sure can well what uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		what do you find are some of the best advantages of credit cards
 	
 	
 		emergencies
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you have one major credit card you can do anything during an emergency
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		other than that then you're more or less have to have money or uh some kind of way of getting some
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so that's probably you know the best thing i can think of
 		the the bad thing is you get accustom to them
 	
 	
 		that's right you can you certainly can
 	
 	
 		you know so i don't know i had i was used to them and then when my me and my husband broke up and i had to pay all the bills that did it i huh-uh none
 		i don't want any
 	
 	
 		well i understand that you know you can't even rent a car hardly or uh
 	
 	
 		with
 	
 	
 		get an airplane ticket without a credit card
 	
 	
 		without one that's right
 	
 	
 		it's
 	
 	
 		unless you got cash money
 	
 	
 		right well even if you have cash it's hard to if you're under twenty five and you you have cash you still can't get still can't rent a car you have to have a credit card
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you can't rent a car no you can't rent a car yep um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that uh i don't know
 	
 	
 		i think the only thing that saves me there is you can rent a car through TI
 		if i really had to rent a car
 	
 	
 		okay you work with TI then okay well you don't even speaking of cash you don't get the five dollars for the phone call you just you get the gift part isn't that how that worked if you're a TI employee
 	
 	
 		but other yeah
 		yeah hum i get a little point and you get so many points and you get the little pick a little gift and that's about it
 	
 	
 		well that's all right that's that's an interesting incentive we uh
 		we wanted to do it because we weren't from the south and i think we would able we'd be able to
 	
 	
 		meet more people or get to know get to know about Texas more or less yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		well not
 		yeah exactly
 		you know get get to i still have a hard time
 		uh understanding some people's accent
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i i can't
 		i i just can't understand what they're saying
 	
 	
 		what
 		yeah some of them have some strong ones
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah there are
 	
 	
 		yeah i've only been here thirteen years so
 	
 	
 		okay where are you originally from
 	
 	
 		
 
 		Los Angeles
 	
 	
 		Los Angeles boy there's a change
 	
 	
 		definitely
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i suppose it's not as cold there as it is here now
 	
 	
 		no now i wish i was back so it's hot
 	
 	
 		well what's life in LA like
 	
 	
 		not good that's why i'm here  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay
 		a lot of crime and
 	
 	
 		oh very high
 	
 	
 		seems to me you know i i couldn't understand why it would be such a heavily populated area if there's so much crime so much smog so much traffic
 	
 	
 		
 
 		because you can't people can't leave you can't just up and leave
 		and not know where you're going
 		i left because i was in the service so i didn't have you know i had a lot to
 		i could leave
 	
 	
 		okay
