 
     		
 	
 		what are some of the TV shows that you watch
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		Major Dad the Monday night comedies on CBS like Major Dad  Murphy Brown is one of my favorites  for huh for some reason she reminds me a lot of myself  it's just the writing i think the writing on that's real good
 	
 	
 		yes i love those
 		
 
 		yes she is great i just love her
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		it is
 	
 	
 		one i miss is uh Doctor Doctor
 	
 	
 		did you watch that one
 	
 	
 		i use we used to when it was on because i i thoroughly enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i didn't
 		did you i guess i never really watched that one i guess by eight o'clock i'm watching football
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i understand that  i do understand that no
 	
 	
 		with my husband so
 		
 
 		yeah that's a big one in our house is Monday night football
 	
 	
 		uh uh yeah well he used to be before we got married but my husband's not a real big football person so my well he is if it's Dallas and if they're on TV but if it's not then we'll watch anything else because he really likes Major Dad and and Murphy Brown and all those too
 	
 	
 		oh he isn't
 		
 
 		right
 		um-hum well that's nice
 		uh-huh and and uh what's the other one oh with the four women Designing Women yes i like that one
 	
 	
 		oh  uh Designing Women yes with the Sugarbakers i think that's one reason i named my daughter Julia  well that well and my great grandmother's name is Julia so we named her that too um
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh really oh that's great
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		do you have kids oh okay i was going to say because we also have to watch Dinosaurs on channel eight because oh not the mama not the mama
 	
 	
 		um no we don't
 		believe me we do too  we do too yes i love that show it's so cute
 	
 	
 		well when my two year old starts saying that it's like okay we we know what he's been watching too for too long i just i
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		yes no we watch that all the time we do it's a good show  i like it and then we watch the Thursday night Cosby and uh um Cheers we watch all the time and
 	
 	
 		oh i like those i
 		
 
 		that's fun
 		but that's normally on Thursday nights we just kind of turn the TV off because neither one of us  really we usually either watch CBS on Monday nights and then the rest of the times it's ABC it's like oh well  we don't watch anything else fine oh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh yeah Thursday night's a big one in our house but um
 	
 	
 		uh we used to when NBC had no that was on Tuesday night um Matlock because i got my mom got me started watching that show just because she liked Andy Griffith so that was fun
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		my husband's a big like mystery watcher like the the late night Hunter and all those he really enjoys those
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh i like yeah i used to like it when Columbo and and all those were on and and Rockford Files but it's like  gosh that seems like a long time ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well my husband really likes those  yeah they are and then we're on we're on a big one with uh Home Front
 	
 	
 		they're fun they're fun
 		yes yes i like that  well no i guess you probably don't get to see Northern Exposure then if he's watching football on Monday nights
 	
 	
 		he that's a real good show
 		sometimes i do if i'm at my sister's house she has two TV's
 	
 	
 		that's it's it's a real strange one it's almost well it's like Twin Peaks but funny
 	
 	
 		it is it's it's
 		right
 	
 	
 		and we did we used to like to watch Twin Peaks for the first season it was like oh this is really neat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then it got weird
 	
 	
 		yeah i and it was a show i never started watching until like one night i decided well they always say this is so weird let's let's watch it and see if we can get the hang of this
 	
 	
 		like real strange
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		huh-uh i couldn't understand by the by the end of it i was just going now what did i just watch for the last hour
 	
 	
 		
 
 		this this
 		no no who did what yeah because it's you really have to be dedicated we would like tape it and send the kids to bed say okay now we can watch this because you have to watch every scene to kind of figure out what it's doing and it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah because i was just like huh
 	
 	
 		even then it's like huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		and then we got like the Time magazine because we used to order that and his face was on the front half distorted and half regular
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and it kind of talked about Twin Peaks and i still just didn't understand what he was talking about  he was something else i just
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it was a really really strange show but  it's like well i'm sorry it's gone but i really didn't got towards the end we didn't watch it at all anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it got too strange because you couldn't pick up on it if you just yeah yeah i like the sitcoms
 	
 	
 		yeah give give me comedies i'll I'll watch those i like those i'm yeah i'm a i'm a comedy kind of person
 	
 	
 		um-hum i really do like just those half an hour sitcoms and that maybe a couple
 	
 	
 		yeah  well because yeah because you can like turn it off  you only have to watch half hour at a time
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's not
 		right and it's always not um week after week and you have to watch every week and you can pick up something the next week and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh well unless it's like you have kids and you have to watch Full House and you have to watch Dinosaurs and you have to watch Urkel on Friday nights and you  you know
