 
     		
 	
 		so who's your favorite team
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers
 	
 	
 		Pittsburgh i used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when i was little
 	
 	
 		you bet
 		well i um
 		when John Stallworth played he was from my hometown in Alabama so i kind of grabbed on to that team
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		huh that's pretty nice
 	
 	
 		way back when
 	
 	
 		that's good i used i used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain or steel curtain
 	
 	
 		that's right how about your favorite team
 	
 	
 		hm well last year it was Buffalo and i i still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just they just impressed me as being so efficient and  they never score they never
 		blow out their opponents they just score just enough points and that really impressed me but i've been down here i live Laural is pretty close to New Orleans and i've been keeping up with the Saints a lot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well they're exciting aren't they
 	
 	
 		yeah the Saints are starting to impress me this year you know a lot
 	
 	
 		boy they are they are just a fun team to watch
 	
 	
 		this it they are really did you see the game Sunday night
 		or Sunday afternoon
 	
 	
 		um no i didn't
 	
 	
 		it was funny they were they had uh a fireworks display at halftime
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding oh my God
 	
 	
 		so they had to stop the game in the middle of the third quarter and put out this fire there was a big piece of something came flaming falling out of the roof landed on the field so there was at big fire on the field and they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything
 	
 	
 		oh i can't believe that
 	
 	
 		it was funny i mean you just really can't tell what's gonna happen
 	
 	
 		that's hilarious
 	
 	
 		i know it's like about two weeks ago i was watching the Saints and Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it it was beautiful right down the middle
 	
 	
 		uh boy he is tough he has a incredible leg
 	
 	
 		he is
 		he is
 	
 	
 		what do you think they're they're gonna be able to make it this year
 	
 	
 		uh i sure
 	
 	
 		past the first play-off game
 	
 	
 		i sure hope so i'm not sure i'm not sure who they play right now i've got it narrowed down to the top four teams
 	
 	
 		who's that
 	
 	
 		it's pretty much going between Washington they're undefeated and uh Buffalo New Orleans and Chicago because Chicago's only lost twice and one of those was to Buffalo
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they beat the Saints their only time they lost
 	
 	
 		what do you think about uh Houston
 	
 	
 		Houston i saw Houston play this summer in Memphis
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah uh from what i saw they were playing when i was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the Houston Oilers
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and from what i saw the game Houston looked Houston impressed me a lot but my brother watched it on TV and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night and if that was an off night i'd hate to see what his uh good night
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh yeah he's
 	
 	
 		um-hum he's hm
 	
 	
 		he definitely uh is one of the best i think
 	
 	
 		yeah the their their backfield is really impressive hm Haywood Jeffries and Drew Hill and Allen Pinkett they really impress me
 	
 	
 		right
 		well they squeaked out a game on Sunday and
 	
 	
 		that's right who who did they play
 	
 	
 		they played Dallas uh they won in overtime
 	
 	
 		Dallas that's right i was because
 		that's right i remember that now
 	
 	
 		so that was i i watched that game and uh that was uh
 	
 	
 		do you have a favorite between those two
 	
 	
 		well because i'm right here in Dallas i i kind of pull for Dallas
 	
 	
 		really they
 	
 	
 		yeah well also Houston is uh in Pittsburgh's division so i'll almost always root against them
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 		that's what i hate to say it but i hate Dallas  i do
 	
 	
 		that's okay well i
 		you know i i was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here and they just kind of grew on me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i imagine that's the way i've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two and they've they've actually started doing something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so i've actually paid paid attention to them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		well do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in
 	
 	
 		to tell you the truth i haven't paid too much attention to that um what cities are they looking at
 	
 	
 		really
 		uh right now i think this Memphis they're they're trying to get a team and that's that's where i was when i saw uh Houston play
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Saint Louis is trying to get a team uh Baltimore is trying to get a team and there's some other city i'm wanting to say Raleigh Durham but i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		you know i think you're right i think it is Raleigh
 	
 	
 		think so
 	
 	
 		i think i remember hearing that
 	
 	
 		um-hum because i i know they've got a world league football team but i think it might be them
 	
 	
 		that'd be fun i'd like to see some more teams get in
 	
 	
 		i would definitely i think they're supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after
 		and right now i think Memphis and
 		it's Memphis and i think Baltimore have a really good shot at it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i know  Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis and when i went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah it's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty two
