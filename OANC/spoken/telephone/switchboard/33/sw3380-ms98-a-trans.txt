 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you go first you called
 	
 	
 		okay uh let's see
 		um
 		well i'm about forty years old so i was um right at draft age back back when uh when that was all going on
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so that pretty it very much affected me as you know as far as being
 		very impressionable right at that time um
 		i i didn't think i was kind of kind of a caught up in the in the hippie movement back then and i didn't think it was uh worthwhile or or right then and i'm not any i'm not like you know i'm not a not that way anymore but i still don't think it was uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh i still have a lot of questions about why we were there and and uh the way it was conducted and all kinds of things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well i'm i'm i'll be forty two in February in fact my husband was in the first lottery you know he he was in the first
 	
 	
 		so you
 	
 	
 		first lottery and uh he got a high draft number thank goodness so he didn't have to go but i never was for it either i um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know i just felt it was a real political thing that i don't really think ever got us anywhere you know i don't i don't feel that we
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that we accomplished much i think maybe i i don't know
 		i i want to say well maybe if we'd gone into really win it but then i i i'm much more of dove than that so i don't know that i would have even liked that i just felt that it it drug on so long and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		at such tremendous cost um and i think it was hard for people to keep up good morale in a situation like that i mean i i can't imagine what it was like for the men fighting over there i think that must have been a really hard thing to um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know to to keep their morale up uh when they knew that we weren't really trying to win and and all of that so i never was really for it i mean uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 		well i was in the uh last lottery
 	
 	
 		oh you were
 	
 	
 		yep and i was i came out number two hundred and fifty one
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i had been and they and uh they only took up two hundred that year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i had been uh in in ROTC too uh so i would at least have a choice about what i was going to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when i came up two hundred and fifty one i went that's it  i dropped out of ROTC and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i i don't uh
 		i guess uh i i kind of do the same thing i kind of think well you know i mean if if at least if we had weren't going all out to win it maybe it would have been worth
 		something but then again i i uh probably too much of a dub my self to really
 	
 	
 		well right i i don't necessarily like that philosophy but i think i would have liked that better than what we did
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what we did
 		yeah because all we had is uh what ten thirteen years and fifty six thousand people and and and we uh i don't know that we did we accomplish anything at all
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		i i i don't think so i mean uh
 	
 	
 		i mean the communists got it anyway
 	
 	
 		and and it's still such a mess in that part of the country today you know it's not like you know i think if things had been resolved and that was in a better situation but i don't think that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh you know i'm not sure that we
 		really accomplished much of anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't know and and i still think we're paying for that i think that there are you know a lot of the men just suffered so terribly in that situation um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i i don't know i i'm glad i never i didn't have anybody well i had one person close to me that went but that's all i didn't know a lot of people that went did you did you
 	
 	
 		yeah i didn't know anyone that that i can recall that went that which is uh now i've met some i've met some after the fact you know people that i worked with and stuff that had been several actually that i worked with that had been but i didn't know i no one that i grew up with
 	
 	
 		well i had one person and he was in the infantry and he was little and what he did was he went into the tunnels
 	
 	
 		uh
 		no you're kidding
 	
 	
 		no and he came back he he lived through it which is just amazing and he would not talk um talk about it much at all
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he he just would not discuss it um
 		he did tell us one time about seeing someone a a a kid about his age you know he was probably twenty i think
 		and he came up upon a a Vietnamese and they both had their guns on each other and they just looked at each other and put their guns down and walked away
 	
 	
 		hm very sensible
 	
 	
 		i i thought so too and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah what what part of the country were you in when all that was going on
 	
 	
 		i'm from Phoenix Arizona
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so i was in Phoenix where were you
 	
 	
 		i was in uh i'm from New York but i was in uh uh Fort Worth
 	
 	
 		oh you came out here to go to school
 	
 	
 		yeah so i was kind of in and i was you know there were there were about twenty hippies on the whole campus i went to TCU and there were there were about twenty hippies on the whole campus and we we were
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we were very much minority  so it was kind of it wasn't like being up in uh Kent State with uh with uh ten thousand protestors that were that were
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well i was in Arizona State and i can remember um
 		coming out i had gone into a restaurant to eat and coming out and there were about oh i don't know how many thousands of students coming down the the street they had completely cordoned off the street and you know there was lots of protesting going on there at the time so i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
