 
     		
 	
 		golfer
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well yes i am as matter of fact not a good one but i am a golfer
 	
 	
 		well
 		well that's about the way i am i don't consider myself a good one but i do enjoy it
 	
 	
 		i uh haven't been out all year i didn't get out this year but uh i enjoy both watching it and playing it
 	
 	
 		i usually play a couple of times a month sometimes more but lately it's been just about that
 		but i do enjoy i think the one of the things i enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses
 	
 	
 		yes and the the peacefulness
 	
 	
 		um-hum you can get out there
 	
 	
 		and the little critters that are around
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really neat you can just get out there and lose yourself in it and forget everything else in the world except what you're seeing out there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right and it's such a personal challenge
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah it really is
 	
 	
 		more than competitiveness against someone else it's it's a competitiveness against yourself
 	
 	
 		and you know it's so frustrating i keep wondering sometimes why do i do this because it's so frustrating you think you do pretty good one day and you're doing a whole lot better you know and then all of a sudden you go back out and it's just terrible
 	
 	
 		well you'll
 	
 	
 		you can't do anything right you know
 	
 	
 		or you'll hear thirty and think boy i've got my game together i've had a par and a birdie and a bogey and then you quadruple bogey
 	
 	
 		boy i'm improving
 		
 
 		uh-huh and and you think my goodness why did i think i was doing better
 	
 	
 		being down there do you uh get to see like the colonial or any of those
 	
 	
 		i don't i guess i could i've never been to a golf to a major golf tournament i uh watch them on TV a lot
 	
 	
 		oh
 		you really should go at least once you know we've had uh the PGA up here uh and and in Tulsa and i've been to both of them and it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it is so much fun to see these players you see on TV to and to hear that ball go whizzing by
 	
 	
 		really
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean it's it's like a bullet going by
 	
 	
 		i'll bet
 		um
 	
 	
 		and you know to to see their concentration and yet to see them how friendly they are when they're they walk by you you know and and how good they are to their spectators
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i've only been playing like about three years now my husband's played for twenty five but i just took it up about three years ago and uh
 		we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments we belong to a country club a little ways outside of Dallas
 		and we have developed a tremendous number of friends that couples do this and you know it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses
 	
 	
 		both
 		yes
 		yes it is and i
 	
 	
 		you can meet some really neat people
 	
 	
 		the scrambles are fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum they really are i just love them
 	
 	
 		i belong to the country club there in El Reno when i lived there and it you know it it's fun because it's so uncompetitive
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you really on those you really go out for fun
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and you know you won't you know you're stroke is just one of one or two or three or four you know that's going to make any difference and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right and you can just do your own thing and be relaxed and enjoy it
 	
 	
 		that's right i used to when i worked at Kerr McGee i used to play in their tournaments
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and uh now that was very competitive
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and i enjoyed it tremendously
 		but uh i i'm more i think i get more enjoyment just couple friends going out and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green so be it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know we just think well the next time's got to be better
 	
 	
 		yeah i have never played in any tournament except just a scramble they have a lot of them there at the club you know they have A B C D type tournaments and then they
 		they have the club championships and everything with the men's women's slots as well but i don't know i've just never really gotten into that now my husband and all the men i mean they love the real competitiveness of playing for money you know
 	
 	
 		oh yes every hole
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but i i'm not good enough for that
 	
 	
 		does your club have a good woman's woman's association
 	
 	
 		yes they do i don't do much with it since uh most of theirs they have a traveling league
 		and uh most of their meetings and all are during the week and i don't don't get to play except on the weekend
 		i work during the week all time
 	
 	
 		it's hard to be a weekend golfer and improve your game
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		someday when i i get where i live closer to the club and partially retired maybe i'll uh be able to play a little more
 		but
 	
 	
 		it uh it's it's a it's a good game i uh
 		i wish i had more time to play and i felt you know had more energy to play it too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
