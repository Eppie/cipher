 
     		
 	
 		okay what kind of house do you live in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh we live in a a brick home in far north Dallas and it's uh
 		four bedrooms and three and a half baths and  swimming pool in the back and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's about thirty five hundred square feet
 	
 	
 		well it sounds like ours are pretty similar i live in one i don't have a swimming pool and mine's about twenty seven hundred square foot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the four bedrooms and all the rest of it sounds just about  about alike i think it's pretty much typical for this area
 	
 	
 		it is have you been living there very long
 	
 	
 		i've been in the house i'm in here right now about twelve and a half years
 	
 	
 		so you've been there longer we built this one about uh it's been
 		let's see
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's been six years six and a half years ago and we subcontracted it on ourselves we bought the lot and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		uh had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications and then we subbed it out so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we've been here a little over six years now and uh have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i bet you have
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my husband got his big garage he had we have a three car garage but he has a big work area in it and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so he has all the work space he needs
 	
 	
 		well that sounds interesting i bet he's enjoyed having it that way because some kind of hard to find one prebuilt that's kind of fits those specifications
 	
 	
 		he
 		it is and that's why we decided to build we looked at things that were already uh built and the garages were always
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if the house were was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have
 	
 	
 		well then most of them don't have a three car garage they're kind of rare
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so we put a three car garage in but even if they had three car garages they didn't have a work space all of it was taken up with just car space
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		well that my we've just got a two car garage but my husband's got a big space in between the where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop you know workbench and everything
 	
 	
 		well sounds like our husbands have similar interests
 	
 	
 		now mine does not work on cars he just piddles on this and that but he likes to have a spot to keep all of his his piddling things
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		uh-huh well that's nice that it's not in your house
 	
 	
 		it really is because you know they have a lot of little things of their own and i you know i wouldn't mind having
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i at one time was gonna fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i someone i don't know it ended up i got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something so i didn't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would
 	
 	
 		right
 		well we still have a a son and daughter in college that come home and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		his parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		well i've still all three of my daughters are married but i don't know i just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time and some of them coming back home and things you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 		oh i understand well
 	
 	
 		and we've got grandchildren now so
 	
 	
 		well we  that's true and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room
 	
 	
 		when they come they have to have a place
 		that's right you sure don't at times i keep thinking though that might be kind of nice
 	
 	
 		well i okay i haven't reached that point yet i've heard people say that but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my middle son is engaged my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while he's out of college and has a good job so he could afford to get married but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		is not engaged yet and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while but she's still in college and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i don't blame you for that
 	
 	
 		that's what she plans to do so i hope so
 	
 	
 		well i have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons
 	
 	
 		oh ho ho
 	
 	
 		and little boys are around the house
 	
 	
 		a whole new world um-hum
 	
 	
 		a whole lot more than girls
 		and uh i enjoy them coming but for short doses
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i can understand
 	
 	
 		it feels after they've been here ten minutes they have already explored the entire house they know everything but they're they're fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute
 	
 	
 		well i just watch them i dust i never did put things up when my kids were little and i haven't with a them i try to teach them not to get into things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 		well that's the same thing that i did and i hope i'll be able to do the same with grandchildren
 	
 	
 		i think that once you do that your children kind of develop the same attitudes at least my daughters have they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up
 		so it's worked pretty well there's i don't really think anything's been broken every now and then we have to kind of go and say now don't bother this you know
 		but all in all they mind pretty well
 		but i guess most of the houses what kind of roof does your house have here i'm getting off the subject
 	
 	
 		well we have
