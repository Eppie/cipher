 
     		
 	
 		all right what's what's the last thing you had done Bernie
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh the last thing i had done or did let's see um  was getting a an old seventy eight Jeep Cherokee ready to trade in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so i was basically just going around and doing what i could do fixing door locks and checking the transfer case fluid and things like that i'm kind of a motor head myself so this topic's actually pretty good for me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh huh
 	
 	
 		um i got a seventy Chevelle that i'm restoring too so it's uh there's constant work going on to that car
 	
 	
 		yeah so you do a lot of a lot of repairs for yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i didn't uh used to do too many repairs but i got we ended up with a real old uh car that kind of needed constant repair just to keep it running
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and um it got to be too expensive to take it in so i started uh
 		i guess the first thing i did was replace the starter you know i did sparkplugs and things and and then i had it needed a starter so i replaced that needed a water pump so i replaced that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh just about a week or two ago i had to pick change an intake manifold gasket which was which for me is you know i mean i'm i'm forty i'd never done much auto repairs until about the last year or so so talking about taking the carburetor off and the
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		uh-huh
 		right i mean that's some that's some serious work not only uh i mean you have to have a yeah i mean you have to have a knowledge of quite a few of the the systems there to to do that what i mean that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it was uh it was
 		yeah well i didn't have i don't have much knowledge of the systems but i just kind of know you know i i make note of when i take a anything off and
 	
 	
 		bet you can
 	
 	
 		and uh  so you know generally if you just kind of make make note of where everything goes as you're taking it off uh you can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		have you tried any like the Chilton's uh manuals
 	
 	
 		no huh how are they
 	
 	
 		oh i i recommend recommend them i've uh used i uh i have a Chilton's manual on my Chevelle and every anytime i undertake anything it i start start with that that book
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well does it tell you kind of a step-by-step how to type of thing oh it does huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah they're they're pretty good um the only problem i've noticed with them is that when i started working on cars i um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh didn't really have much knowledge of them at all and and you know it's hard
 		the language of motor automotive mechanics is a language all it's own and just the names of some of the parts you know they tell you to put the wrench on something and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah i have trouble with that trying to talk to people at parts shops shops now
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah you know and it took a while before you figure out what everything is and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and what you are supposed to be doing with it but i i think it's a lot better than than starting from starting cold and that's for sure
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah  what kind of uh well you pretty well do everything
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to uh pay to have tune-ups done and uh oh brake jobs and things and kind of had to do them  on this old car and and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i don't think i'd ever pay to have someone put plugs and and things in and the brake changing brake pads is that was easy
 	
 	
 		oh i know brake job
 	
 	
 		that was nothing that was nothing i you know i didn't have to bleed the lines down or anything but it looked like if you were just um it looked like in most cases you probably couldn't get air in those lines is is that right
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i i don't know i've get i've gotten the Chevelle i've did done the brakes all the way around it myself and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that was easy
 	
 	
 		well this this one's got drum brakes though drum brakes drum brakes are a little bit tougher than disc brakes but um but still it's not anything that that
 	
 	
 		okay
 		tougher
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it's just a matter of putting the parts in the right place and there isn't really anything you can do wrong to it um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and those ones did have to have the lines bled though but but bleeding the lines is just a matter of uh you know just having somebody on the uh pumping the pedal the brake pedal for you and when it's
 	
 	
 		they did
 		yeah and you just open a a valve of some sort until till fluid comes out i guess yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah well that uh the disc brakes i mean that you know i i used to pay like sixty seventy dollars to have that done i spent spent ten bucks on pads
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it took a couple hours and they just they just snap in basically i mean it was it was uh it was easy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah there's no not not too much trick for that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they're uh buy i just this new vehicle i buy i just bought a ninety one GMC Sonoma which is a little pickup truck with a
 		and i'm wondering when the time comes for the maintenance on this thing how much i'm gonna be able to do myself and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how much is going to require all their diagnostics and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it looks pretty simple i used to have an eighty five Chrysler Laser and this one certainly looks a lot more simple than than that motor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh i haven't i haven't gotten into fuel injectors and things like that and that thing's fuel injected so i don't know what uh um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how that will will be the only thing i've ever done on a fuel injector is replace the hose on it it was leaking so  i don't know
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i like the old cars open up the hood on my Chevelle and there's nothing under there but a big motor and uh  and you know no
