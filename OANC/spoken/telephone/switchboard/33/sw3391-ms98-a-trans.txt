 
     		
 	
 		go  what have you seen
 	
 	
 		do you want to talk first about the one that you've seen or you want me to go
 	
 	
 		oh mine was too scary go ahead
 	
 	
 		the last movie that i saw was Little Man Tate
 	
 	
 		oh was it good
 	
 	
 		it was was a lot of fun yeah it was um  real popular obviously it was about a week after it'd come out i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i didn't really have any um  preconceived notions of what it was gonna be about so it was fun to i don't wanna tell you about it i don't know if i should uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah have you seen Paradise
 		with uh Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson no i haven't seen that one either i was hoping you well
 	
 	
 		um
 		no no
 		let's see what else have you seen recently we can talk about one we've both seen
 	
 	
 		well i rented we rented my daughter and her friend i have teenagers rented Silence of the Lambs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		have you seen it oh it's
 	
 	
 		no see that
 		that's the kind of film that i probably wouldn't see um there's certain ones that my husband and i know that he might see with a friend and i wouldn't want to see
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well i probably shouldn't have
 		yeah i i don't know that i don't know my husband chose not to watch it and he obviously slept all night and i prayed really hard that my kids wouldn't have nightmares and i had nightmares for two nights
 	
 	
 		
 
 		did you yeah
 	
 	
 		oh it's just it's so interesting but it that is the last one that i saw on home video
 	
 	
 		and and did your kids have any reaction to it what were the kind of comments that they had
 	
 	
 		well i probably shouldn't have let my younger ones watch it they are um
 		seven and nine and eleven years old but and especially after this Jeffrey Dahmer thing really had my eleven year old going
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		you know and it was and he had lots of questions and i had to do a lot of reassuring but what my kids made some really interesting observations about how Hannibal the Cannibal you know was um playing with this gal's mind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh they were aware that that
 	
 	
 		you know which was something he was supposed to watch for and i mean it was very awful and you know it teaches them to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um be careful of strangers and and and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i guess there is that in those scary movies there's definitely the element of uh caution
 	
 	
 		oh yeah so that was
 		but i have bought Fantasia for my kids and myself actually
 	
 	
 		you know i i would like that as well i i've been looking for that and i haven't found it yet but i know that it's um  i think it's at not not the warehouse but uh
 	
 	
 		Costco those those kind of places kind of discount places yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah Blockbuster Video that's the one that i think i heard that it was
 	
 	
 		oh yeah but you yeah you can just buy now the one i'm buying is a used one which i don't get till December so people will be using it until December but i got it for nine bucks so
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		you know yeah well i hope it'll be okay that's the one movie of all movies that i'm gonna buy
 	
 	
 		no i i have to ask you about foreign films have you seen Angel at My Table
 	
 	
 		no is it wonderful
 	
 	
 		uh oh it's kind of like My Left Foot if you had a chance to see that it's very much like that you know it focuses on an individual who has
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes i did see that oh
 	
 	
 		well in in her case she's very very shy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and that's not a physical disability but it's certainly a social emotional disability in her case and it it's really beautiful you know because it shows how she blossoms and and about her her her development
 	
 	
 		oh yeah sure
 		oh
 		Angel at My Table
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um another one that i really liked was called Truly Madly Deeply
 	
 	
 		okay we'll keep an eye out
 		nope
 	
 	
 		i believe it's a British film as well and it came well there there are a couple they they tend to you know show up in San Francisco so
 	
 	
 		so you like foreign films
 		yes yeah more than Yakima Washington i'm afraid
 	
 	
 		there are a couple theaters that usually show good ones you can count on them to show foreign films that you you feel like you might enjoy as opposed to some that are so eclectic that you can't really relate to them
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		right  right
 	
 	
 		and um Truly Madly Deeply is a love story about a person's let's see it's her husband that dies it came out shortly after Ghost
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		oh and Ghost was your one of your favorites
 	
 	
 		so um i i kind of i kind related to it a little bit because it it was about her husband's love and her love being so strong that he was able to sort of
 		converse with her after he died in such a way to kind of help her make the separation from his death because she was having really hard time grieving for like a year or so after his death and
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		uh-huh
 		and it was called what Truly
 	
 	
 		Truly Madly Deeply
 	
 	
 		Truly Madly Deeply
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's how they they used to have a a a game about how much they loved each other they'd loved each other truly no truly madly no truly madly deeply
 	
 	
 		sounds wonderful
 		oh i see oh it sounds wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a sweet film it's actually kind of a a spoof on life after death because
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he not only comes back to visit her and help her make the transition after his death but he brings all of his his friends and a lot of them are you know playing cards in her house and
 	
 	
 		his friends oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		jamming on musical instrument it it's pretty it's pretty funny
 	
 	
 		oh well that would be comforting in a way you know
 		oh  well that's great um what else have i seen
 		oh well we went to see um and you won't you don't go see dumb things but it was called Hot Shots totally a waste of
 	
 	
 		um Hot Shot
