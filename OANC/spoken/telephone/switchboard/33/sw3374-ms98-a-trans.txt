 
     		
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you want to start
 	
 	
 		yes on uh taking care of the elderly do you have an older relative that you are concerned with right now
 	
 	
 		i just have one grandmother that's that's alive and i'm she's i think in her low eighties but she lives by herself and takes care of herself and stuff and she's healthy
 	
 	
 		i see
 		that's very important
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i tell you i have uh faced this whole subject myself because my mother is not quite that old but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		she uh has Parkinson's and uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		we tried taking care of her in the house and it got to where it wasn't safe and then uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we had to to uh try different things and finally she's in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		hm did you hear they're coming closer to a cure for Parkinson's
 	
 	
 		um i hope so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because it really is a bad disease
 	
 	
 		because a lot of people in uh i think a country like Guam or something have it so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um they're studying those people and coming closer to a cure
 	
 	
 		well they know what causes it uh and you know it's a an insufficiency in the brain
 	
 	
 		what
 		um-hum i think it was it was on the news and they mentioned something like that some chemical
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh
 		so far they haven't uh that i know of they haven't figured out why there's a deficiency and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the medicine they give them is supposed to replace it but it it doesn't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it also has side affects
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how do you feel about having to place someone in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i hope i can take care of my parents someday i hope i can afford to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		um i guess it depends on what the nursing home's like because there's some very nice ones that i wouldn't mind checking into it myself
 	
 	
 		hm well well
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		i think another part of it it depends on whether you are uh physically able to do it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to give them the care they need
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's true if you have to work you know you don't have a choice
 	
 	
 		well and then too uh i found that even if i didn't work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i couldn't hold up to taking care of mother twenty four hours a day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because
 	
 	
 		it's hard work
 	
 	
 		it just uh
 		uh you know she couldn't do anything by herself and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		her mind wonders and she wonders
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i've tried it on weekends and stuff and
 		i
 		my feeling on it
 	

 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		is that the nursing home is there if you need it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you hope you don't need it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think your health is important as important as theirs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um have you ever thought about what uh kind of things you would look for in a nursing home if you ever had to choose
 	
 	
 		well i guess just a nice caring environment for one thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and just
 		cheery atmosphere
 		um i've gone to this nursing home over on um Forest Lane and Greenville out there
 	
 	
 		um
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um just for like field trips i'm a teacher and i take my students to nursing homes because um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		good
 	
 	
 		we study old age and stuff and um there's this one particular one over there that i've visited that was really nice and the director would hug the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		elderly people you know hello and um we the days we were there we played games with them and just real nice atmosphere real cheerful atmosphere and it's a gorgeous nursing home too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		they love the the older people love to be around children too
 	
 	
 		um-hum and the kids i have to like drag them out of there too so
 	
 	
 		isn't that great
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i think it's mutual
 	
 	
 		yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		so like a grandparent or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um
 		i don't know if i could
 	
 	
 		course there's a
 	
 	
 		um put my parents in a place like that i wouldn't feel bad
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		well i think the worst worst thing about having to do it is the guilt you do feel
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think the first thing is you have to be absolutely sure that's what you need to do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i know
 		in in my situation we had to consider nursing care and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's another thing medical
 	
 	
 		the doctor available and the fact that it's clean and you also have to you have to uh pay attention to how much it costs too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um yeah i bet because it can probably cost a fortune
 	
 	
 		um-hum it it can and it costs more than most people make in a year
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		does insurance help cover it at all or
 	
 	
 		there is a special insurance you can buy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for nursing home insurance in fact my husband and i take it
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		
 
 		because we hope we never have to use it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh it would uh
 		take care of an interim period until you know if it was a long-term care until Medicaid would kick in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do you have children or
 	
 	
 		because Medicaid uh pardon
 	
 	
 		do you have children
 	
 	
 		yes i have four
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um-hum but uh
 	
 	
 		so you have um plenty of people to take care of you some day
 	
 	
 		well um
