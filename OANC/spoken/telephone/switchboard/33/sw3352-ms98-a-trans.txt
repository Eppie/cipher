 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've uh
 		oh uh
 		are you there all right okay  um
 	
 	
 		yes sir i'm right here
 	
 	
 		i'm in an area where um we can uh enjoy it year round so i've actually been uh uh been out within the past couple of weeks
 		i'm mainly freshwater fisherman how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well actually i've done both kinds uh i'm originally from the state of Virginia
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh lived uh near Virginia Beach where we could uh surf cast and uh catch a lot of things in the ocean there
 	
 	
 		do you ever
 		did you ever do the James River
 	
 	
 		i don't believe i have fished the James River
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		there's a possibility but that was so long ago i moved here to to State College uh in nineteen fifty five and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we have a lot of uh beautiful fresh water streams that come through this this area i'm in an area called Center County which is in the very center of the state of Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		i've  i've been in that area and the trout fishing's supposed to be legendary
 	
 	
 		the trout fishing is really uh beautiful as i say the the streams are oh eight ten fifteen feet wide and so forth and uh
 		you you stand on the edge and you you cast out and you you work uh from your feet most of the time and then there are there are a few lakes of course close by
 	
 	
 		uh-huh for brookies
 		what do you like brookies or uh rainbows or
 	
 	
 		well tell you the truth i'm i'm not uh not picky i wherever the area whatever the fish is the specialist in that area i uh i enjoy fishing for it and i try to i haven't fished in several years i'll have to admit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but when i do fish i do contact uh some of the local specialists
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that i can then find out the uh the type of lures that they use and where they fish and any unique uh techniques that would help you
 	
 	
 		do you fly fish or are those streams too small
 	
 	
 		uh no we fly we fly fish um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i used to do that a little when i lived up in New York but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right now it's uh uh bass and striped bass is the only thing that uh i go for down in Dallas in uh Texas
 	
 	
 		oh that's a pretty big fish
 	
 	
 		uh yeah they're they've uh the striped bass have accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes and they're pretty exciting when they're when they're running
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's a salt water fish in fresh water uh environment
 		it's
 	
 	
 		well well our our streams streams here are replanted with fish uh about every year
 	
 	
 		it's all put and take
 	
 	
 		so that well they they they uh they have a pretty good idea of of uh
 		what what the number of fish are in these various locations and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they have  have certain areas that they plant you know a hundred here and a hundred there and this is of course x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens so
 	
 	
 		what's the season April to September October or something like that
 	
 	
 		that sounds about right um-hum pretty close
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah what's a license cost
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well as i say it's been several years but the licenses weren't that expensive i seems to sticks in my mind five to seven dollars is about all what i remember
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		it's about the same as Texas yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and i have oh probably a a half a dozen different kinds of uh fishing poles and and fly rods and so forth and
 		and i had been so busy in my work in these last few years that i haven't had time to fish
 		but i'm going to be retiring at the end of December and i i hope uh the next fishing season that i can sort of get back in and uh enjoy that that that was a really enjoyable uh thing for me to do
 	
 	
 		well i have all sons so i think i'm probably going to be fishing for a long time
 	
 	
 		huh i just have one son and he he lives uh out of the state now or rather in the eastern corner of it so i don't think he has time to fish either
 	
 	
 		i caught the disease from my father and i'm passing it on to my children it's really
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		they love it yeah
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness well i i uh the disease i caught was simply because uh i was i was i was in the Norfolk Portsmouth area and people there there's there's so much water around that you you you're either boating or you're fishing
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i fairly enjoyed it that time i have a small uh aluminum boat here that uh when i go on one of the large lakes that we have here that i enjoy fishing for for trout
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		what what are the  i i don't i don't know about the lakes in central Pennsylvania are there many
 	
 	
 		from that
 		well as i say i'm in Center Center County there's um there are two different size lakes about
 		well five five to six miles from State College now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view but they are probably fifteen twenty acres maybe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which which here is a lot of water where boats
