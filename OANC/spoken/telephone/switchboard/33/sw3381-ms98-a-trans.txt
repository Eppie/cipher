 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i guess it's uh
 		watching the radio the TV today there had a lot of stuff on on uh crime in our state right now uh recently they've had a lot of uh
 		uh the rapists uh murder type uh killers going around and
 	
 	
 		oh gracious
 	
 	
 		and well i i they've caught them and they they're in there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh wasn't it your state that had the um guy that committed all those murders
 		there was that um
 	
 	
 		uh well yeah Wisconsin uh and Milwaukee area yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that was really on the national news a lot
 		we heard a lot about that in Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no that's
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i i live right on the border Minnesota and Wisconsin so i kind of get both both news and
 		i know in Minnesota uh
 		they had uh the one that just uh got out and went after a uh college student and raped and killed her and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they're not too happy about that now
 	
 	
 		well i can imagine it seems like the
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		violent crimes are increasing a lot to me i i don't know
 		i don't know if statistically they are but it seems like you sure hear a maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah uh that's hard to say for sure i uh sometimes i wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity and
 	
 	
 		you wonder about that sometimes
 	
 	
 		they they get their names in the in the paper and they become big celebrities
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's kind of scary i'd i'm  wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these
 		way out stories maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas
 	
 	
 		well uh i know one thing i i think Texas has the death penalty right
 	
 	
 		yes we do do you have it up there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		see i i not
 	
 	
 		do you think that's a deterrent
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh
 		it's it's it's not gonna prevent any people from doing it but the person that's caught he'll never do it again if he gets the death penalty and that's and there are a lot of repeaters uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		i guess that's another thing that to me is a a real problem and i know we've got so many people in our prison system now at least here in Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean they're really in a crisis there's been times they've had to
 		just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a lot of them they put out on parole and then some of the ones that they put out early
 		you know do repeat offenses and the crime rate's the worst than ever before
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah well some i'm just wondering a lot of times they'll put uh people lesser crimes
 		in uh with uh
 		people that did more severe crimes and they maybe they just tend to learn from these people
 		and they and when they get back out they just go into worse crimes and
 	
 	
 		i think that could be true too
 	
 	
 		maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more
 		um
 	
 	
 		i think the whole parole thing you know if somebody's convicted of
 		second degree murder or something gets fifteen years well they're out in
 		six or seven you know outbound on the streets again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and to me that's really scary some some of these crimes that they commit you know seems like the punishment's not
 		really equal to the crime
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		i don't know uh with with my limited uh psychology background i do have uh i don't i don't even feel that prisons and stuff are are the answer
 		if you wanna stop the crime i think you got to get uh the people when they're kids
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		a lot of this probably just starts with from the from the homes also from the the the media the TV you see uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		all these uh gory movies on there becomes uh just natural fact of life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i think it's okay thing to do
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's a very good point you know i there's a lot more working mothers a lot more kids in day care centers
 		all that kind of thing morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well a lot of the European countries uh they tend to censor well they probably won't censor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent
 	
 	
 		and
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they have a lot less crime
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		some of some of those European countries are are you can leave your your uh doors open and and and be safe
 		uh even uh i think New Zealand is
 		one of one of the places uh that's not
