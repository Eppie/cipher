 
     		
 	
 		ah i guess my personal opinion i i don't mind paying taxes necessarily i I just sometimes wonder if our money's being used in the best way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		ah sometimes when i hear what what they're even what even what the politicians are making you know when when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that ah
 		i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them ah
 		and that's all tax money when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much it's just billions of dollars that's i think is just being thrown away
 	
 	
 		right right and then when you read about that they're spending all the money on you know these studies that have no relevance whatsoever
 		that kind of ticks you off too but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		somebody somebody was telling me the other day that they heard
 		some senator say that
 		what we're paying
 		it's not that we mind paying taxes it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i i i tend to agree with that i'm not really into
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what they're doing per se and i think there's just too many too many levels of bureaucracy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it can be
 		can be managed by
 		by less ah
 		less levels
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well i i know anytime there's there's a big uh uh budget cut you know i work with the state and anytime there's there is a budget cut or crunches it's always the small guy that that gets hurt
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's never the uh the person that's making a hundred thousand there it's always the person that's making the least amount and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		ah and and sometimes we're running around there i see these these ah
 		ah supervisors running around ah having meetings i i really don't know what they do i sometimes wonder are are they really doing anything or
 	
 	
 		right
 		right well i think we're gonna see
 		a streamlining in the government
 		i just you know i i don't know what kind of uh
 		i don't know what what level or  what how long it will take for you know our country to start
 		the public in general to start saying hey this is too much we're not gonna pay anymore
 		you know we're not gonna pay for this and you're out you know i think we're starting to see it a little bit now but i think uh
 		i don't know what what kind of
 		input we're gonna get from the public and how they're gonna go about doing it
 		because i think i think we're just getting taxed way too much
 		i mean right now we're getting taxed probably
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		probably around thirty five percent or more and that's that's you know that's me not making a whole lot of money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well they got so many hidden taxes that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store or something like that and you're paying a little tax here and you
 	
 	
 		well
 		right
 	
 	
 		so yeah gas i don't know about you guys i but there's probably at least about twenty five to to thirty cents of different taxes on on our gas
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you don't realize it
 	
 	
 		yeah we got a sales tax our sales tax is like eight percent and i don't know what our gas tax is i think it's somewhere around
 		twenty five cents a gallon
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		i mean they're hitting us up and they may not
 		they may not raise it
 		you know federally as much one year but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the or the sales tax or property tax or whatever
 		it's just
 		i mean
 		you can see that you're money is just not going that far
 	
 	
 		yeah well i know they say like with Reagan they say no new taxes but they changed the ah deductions on you and that just raises your taxes you know they just get it a different way
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i mean to me it did uh raise my taxes
 	
 	
 		right
 		well
 		i mean you can tell just by
 		just by how much money you have left over and all of a sudden
 		i don't know it's just it's eating me alive
 	
 	
 		yeah i i heard someone say that uh
 		if they would just  something about uh with the uh
 		the defense budget all that extra money they're throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars
