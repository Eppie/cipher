 
     		
 	
 		uh did you hear i guess you heard the subject right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh right magazines
 	
 	
 		right well i tell you i'm about a magazine junkie so this is right up my alley
 	
 	
 		oh good okay well go ahead and start and pick one
 	
 	
 		okay well see i subscribe to Consumer Report Texas Monthly D Time my husband's now getting Hotrod
 		and then i pick up Money magazine and then a couple of women's you know if when i stroll through the supermarket  and uh i don't know i just love magazines  for some reason
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i even like People magazine but i hate to buy it because you can read it in twenty minutes and then you feel like you wasted your money you know   oh
 	
 	
 		well let's see i subscribe to Bon Appetite uh Vogue Bazaar and um a home decorating magazine that's all i can think of
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i bet your house looks nice and mine is decorated the way it was seventeen years ago
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm not a woman's woman by the looks of this house i need to get a woman's woman in here to help me out  but i do like to cook or i used to seems like
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know the busier you get the that kind of lose you lose out on that some
 	
 	
 		it is it's difficult well let's see you you have one in particular that oh i subscribed to at one time and haven't for some time but i think is really interesting is Consumer Reports
 	
 	
 		right yeah we do subscribe to that it is interesting and you really get some surprises in there too and if if you would read it religiously you would save a lot of money
 	
 	
 		do you go ahead
 		well do you actually act on any of the uh tips that they give you
 	
 	
 		oh yes i i we really do uh go out and look for some of the brands you know and then then we'll lose the copies or  some'll get thrown away and we'll get sloppy you know
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but uh uh many many times we have acted on it yeah because sometimes the cheaper brand is is better than a leading one you know
 	
 	
 		it's one i probably ought to resubscribe to you know particularly if you're getting ready to buy some kind of a major product
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it's interesting even with the everyday you know like the shampoos and all um they had one i recall not too many years ago that they were talking about the various brands of shampoos and how uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah i remember that
 	
 	
 		yeah and the most expensive ones were not the ones that they recommended
 	
 	
 		i know they've done that before on uh mascara and different kinds of makeup too well you know i was at a a wedding reception once and there was a girl there that was a chemist for one of the oh who is that uh famous makeup Mary Kay i think it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she said well the truth of the matter was there was just only a handful of basic products you could make cosmetics out of anyway so they were nearly all pretty similar
 	
 	
 		i kind of have heard that too but you know how much do you want to pay uh for the brand to feel glamorous or whatever uh-huh exactly
 	
 	
 		right
 		for the packaging
 		so uh and that always stood out in my mind and i really buy a lot of cheap uh lipsticks and i think they're just as pretty and they last as long as the real expensive ones
 	
 	
 		well i only do Maybelline mascara because i think it's the best i guess they're gonna kill us if we talk about our cosmetics instead of magazines but
 	
 	
 		right yeah that's what i have
 		oh that's right i forgot i wonder who has to listen to all this garbage
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's got to be a boring job
 	
 	
 		i know this is only my second call i just kept forgetting about it and then my phone wasn't working and i'd get a call every now and then and i'd put my PIN number in and they'd say this is incorrect then then somebody suggested it was the phone sure enough we had a new phone
 		and so now i had to switch phones so i'm just trying to make some calls and catch up how many have you made
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ah i was in the project oh maybe six or eight months ago ah and then oh i made maybe five six seven and then they had some problems on the system and i just kind of got out of it and this is the first one since they brought it back up again that i have done
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right uh
 	
 	
 		but um from what i understand they get people from all over the country but i i
 	
 	
 		yeah my daughter was on it last time well we didn't know it was only supposed to be my husband so anytime anybody called we punched in number and talked well that got to and she talked to somebody several times from Virginia
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i've never gotten anyone outside the Dallas area
 	
 	
 		well me either i i was uh in fact i haven't gotten anyone over here i'm in Arlington i usually get Garland or Mesquite or Dallas but it's kind of interesting isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes it is
 	
 	
 		i know i wonder if it's really gonna help them
 	
 	
 		well it helps us with our five dollars a call
 	
 	
 		oh i know did you get a present or money last time
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		we we got a what what was it my husband works for TI so we couldn't get the money we had to choose something but it was neat we got a camera and he got a real nice attache case which he needed anyway
 	
 	
 		well that's fun
 	
 	
 		right do y'all work for TI or you just heard about it
 	
 	
 		no just a friend of mine ah introduced me to it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh okay i'm gonna get us back on magazines so we can okay now i'm gonna ask you your opinion of the the perfume tear strip in magazines when you get those
 	
 	
 		oh right right
 		well i like them i've heard people are allergic to them or something
 	
 	
 		i do too i think they're great
 		well if you do nothing else with them i tear them out of the books and put them in my lingerie drawers or something
 	
 	
 		i just read about that in the paper the other day and uh i need to do that that's a great idea  no i like them a lot and uh i've bought you know
 	
 	
 		sure
