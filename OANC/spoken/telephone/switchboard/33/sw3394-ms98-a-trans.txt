 
     		
 	
 		okay do you
 	
 	
 		well the magazines that i subscribe to are i i'm i don't know if you're familiar is Better Homes and Gardens
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm familiar a little bit
 	
 	
 		okay and um Sesame Street  okay
 	
 	
 		Sesame Street yeah we've had that one before
 		and uh i don't presently subscribe to any i think we've subscribed i've subscribed to Sports Illustrated and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i think we've taken Sesame Street actually before and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's the big hit in this in this house the Sesame Street because they have um you know the calendars and that kind of thing but i take the recipes and the home gardening and the furnishings from Better Homes and Gardens
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you uh do you do you read it all the way through everytime how often does it come out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		once a month
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i yeah i read it all the way through more than once and my husband i find him reading it too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah huh
 	
 	
 		so and it's a free subscription my mother gave it to us so
 	
 	
 		oh well that's the the best kind oh oh we've uh i've had Sports Illustrated we've had National Geographic when it was free my my mother got that for us it was free so we and uh
 		but um  i guess i found um i really i like reading them but i never i never seem to have because Sports see the Sports Illustrated's weekly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it and i just didn't seem to have time to sit down and read it
 	
 	
 		oh we we're always reading magazines because we we don't really subscribe to them we usually buy them off the rack and we're always buying Life and People and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh a few others i can't really think about but we're we're always reading magazines in this house and oh and Time Time and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we're we're we're always reading magazines in this house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um we saved all the Time Magazines from the um
 		from when um we went to war so we have all of those uh-huh well we saved yeah we saved them we thought maybe maybe they'd you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh you have a whole collection from the Gulf War
 		well that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		be useful later on in life when the boys grow up because we have two small
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah do you get Life every month
 	
 	
 		um no the we don't purchase subscribe to those we just get them like maybe
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah when it looks interesting yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh maybe once every three months or something like that but
 	
 	
 		i haven't gotten a copy of that in well actually i don't know i my parents used to take it and uh when it was weekly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that that was i used to read it all the time then and i really haven't looked at it much since it went monthly except in the grocery line picking it up and looking looking at the pictures in it looked looked interesting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah
 		and my husband is the kind of person that prefers prefers the um  what do you call those the uh The Sun and um The Star
 		yeah those suck  yeah he likes he loves those he'll read he'll read those all the time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah those the the tabloid things oh
 		does he really and and and and you and you fess up to it huh
 	
 	
 		no i just i don't i don't read them
 	
 	
 		but you admit your husband does  huh
 	
 	
 		yeah he does all the time and
 	
 	
 		isn't that funny huh
 	
 	
 		and he'll sneak one home every once in a while in the grocery cart but that's just those i don't know those are just things i don't really i don't know i don't really find interesting i don't believe and he'll show me an article or two i i i don't believe it anyway so it's not
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah i glance at them in line um but the stories are so ridiculous you know i mean uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's what he does he he'll stand in line and just laugh
 	
 	
 		right seven year old gives birth to twins and um uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh ninety nine year old uh elopes with ten year i mean you know i just huh
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah well he he loves all of those yeah so those are his kind of
 		great role model for the kids i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum i read um the newspaper like every day and i guess um
 		as i was thinking about it before the what i guess i like about the magazines is the article they'll cover the same material sort of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but more more um more in depth and more thought out and more the whole picture instead of just you know one little
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh yeah
 		yeah
 		we usually just get get the newspaper on weekends because we really don't have time during the week but we usually get Friday's Saturday's and Sunday's and that's really about it but uh we read like the Dallas Life Magazine you know in there and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		those kind of pretty interesting so i mean just talking to you i i i realize how much we read i didn't really realize that that's just amazing
 	
 	
 		say it sounds like you read quite a bit really yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we do now that i think about it we do read a lot so
 	
 	
 		i don't i've gotten to where i don't get one unless i'm on a trip a magazine
 	
 	
 		oh really oh
 	
 	
 		yeah just just about i mean i'll pick up when i'm going somewhere i'll pick up a People and and uh usually a Sports Illustrated and uh occasionally i'll go to the library and and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know they have all the current ones every every week and i'll sit down and and read them read them there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah that's a good idea yeah i've only done it once but i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i uh i've got teenage kids so i you know they're usually there doing stuff and i'm and not ready to leave at the appointed hour so i end up i end up sitting you know while they're
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
