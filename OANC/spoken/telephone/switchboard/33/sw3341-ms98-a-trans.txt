 
     		
 	
 		okay what uh what do you mean by camping
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well i work i work out at Scarborough Fair down Waxahachie and i'd i'd camp out there during the uh the the open season that we're open down there so i've got my tent and my all that stuff going and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		tent sleeping bag and i i just leave it all down there over the weekend or during the week while i'm gone and and come back and crawl in and everything's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right where i left it i don't have to set it up once a week or anything like that but it's a lot easier
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh so like camping to you means tent camping and sleeping bag and to some people camping's going out you know in a motor home
 	
 	
 		yeah that's  that's that's those the the the wimps way out to rough it  but uh
 	
 	
 		oh no camping camping to me is
 		you you know like the question said there's different types of camping and going out in a tent and not being around any sort of facilities shower facilities or bathroom facilities and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		uh i don't like to get that extreme
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't really particularly care for that you know i don't mind staying in tents with sleeping bags and everything but i like you know a bathroom near or shower near
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's that's what's nice about working out at Scarborough and the uh the participants have a uh a a separate shower thing that we all are go use and everything so don't have to bother with Port-a-Pots or anything like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right you know when when i was younger i would go up into Colorado and you know and we'd go up and we'd hike up into the mountains and camp with tents you know and we wouldn't have anything and now that i've gotten a little older
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		a little like some of the finer things in life  yeah i  i was in Boy Scouts when i was a kid and so i i've done  dealt with all that fun stuff
 	
 	
 		right  like
 		right i don't like to go camping now and stay in a tent without one of the big thick air mattresses to sleep on because  ground's a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah i i
 		i i keep a uh one of those uh those banana lounge chairs that have the two parts that fold on it
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		i unfold one of those and throw my sleeping bag on it and if i have to crawl in i crawl in if not i just lay on top of it you know depending on how cold it is whatever  and i i i never touch the floor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right i i've tried those too  only part of those is that that they're really not wide enough for your arms to have any place to hang down you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah uh i can get comfortable anywhere  but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so some people like to use the uh the the Coleman uh cook stoves and stuff no uh uh real fire real fire got to have a fire pit
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 		no
 		yeah i i don't either you know some people even bring charcoal with them  and um
 	
 	
 		yeah charcoal charcoal is nice if the ground is sopping wet otherwise  grab a dead tree
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's that's what i like to use and they just kind of look at me and go well why are you gonna go to that trouble we have this Coleman stove here
 	
 	
 		because i want i want my food to taste like i just cooked it over a you know a fire pit not over
 	
 	
 		i just look at them and go
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		propane
 	
 	
 		that's like the people that bring instant coffee with them too and heat up their water and i go what's wrong with the coffee pot you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what's wrong with the good old coffee pot throw the grounds in heat the water up
 	
 	
 		yeah  that's right well i enjoyed talking with you
 	
 	
 		okay thank you
 	
 	
 		thank you bye-bye
