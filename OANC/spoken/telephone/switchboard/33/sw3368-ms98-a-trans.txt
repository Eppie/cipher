 
     		
 	
 		okay what type of things do you feel would invade your privacy everyday
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um hm well i don't like it when um people listen to my phone conversations like if they're outside my door while i'm talking in my room
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or when people like look through my things in my bedroom
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right that is really an invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i find i find it very annoying when i've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly with solicitors and the carpet cleaning companies and does that happen in your part of the country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes um-hum definitely
 	
 	
 		i uh i come home and i'm trying to get a few things done and i can't do anything but answer the telephone
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		some evenings are worse than others but i wish i could put a stop to it but i don't know what to do to stop it
 	
 	
 		right even uh we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting and they'd still come to our door and knock and
 	
 	
 		um-hum they'll think it didn't mean them i guess everybody but me  oh goodness
 	
 	
 		i guess not no yeah
 	
 	
 		are you still do you live at home with your parents
 	
 	
 		yes um-hum
 	
 	
 		um-hum  so your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah mostly yeah
 	
 	
 		now what can you do to stop that
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know well  i'm used to it now but  sometimes it still gets gets to me but there's not much i can really do no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no just have to live with it i guess try to remember to respect their privacy and maybe they'll respect yours and
 	
 	
 		you know it
 		well i don't know  i always um no yes i do but they don't live at home
 	
 	
 		do you have brothers
 		oh okay i was raised i had two younger brothers and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations and
 	
 	
 		oh i used to do that though because i was the youngest i'd pick up the phone and listen to theirs  but i
 	
 	
 		i would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me and then they'd go get on the other extension and i could hear them but i couldn't get them to hang up you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i
 		yeah  but i stopped doing that a long time ago and they still do it to me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		even it in the office i uh find that people walk up and and when you're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy they'll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up
 	
 	
 		oh like say yeah this lady does that to me at work when i'm taking an order or something and she'll just sit there and listen and  like i'm doing something wrong and she just started and she's nice but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay but you know it gets annoying when they stand right over you and watching everything you do
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		i'm
 	
 	
 		let's see i can't think of anything else i'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors about the only thing that really bothers me i don't have that many people coming to my door
 	
 	
 		no
 		right well occasionally we'll have a person here or there but not not as many as the phone calls you know so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and i guess that's really the the thing that really bugs me the most i can't think
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		that her kids in our neighborhood used to bother me but they have all gotten grown up now and we live in a neighborhood where there's not any little kids to bother me since mine are all grown up but
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what else would be an annoyance well i guess traffic could be an annoyance
 	
 	
 		oh yeah especially when you're in a hurry
 	
 	
 		do you have a lot of traffic in your area
 	
 	
 		um
 		it can get busy yeah usually on the weekends it's the most bit but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		some days it's real real bad here and you would like to
 		feel like it's an invasion of privacy because you can't even ride down the road without people all the way around you you know but
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum yeah i've traveled quite a bit and i've been through Dallas Texas it's pretty busy
 	
 	
 		it really is and pretty noisy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it really is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i live right on a main thoroughfare so when i first moved here i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy because it at first you'd hear a lot of noise especially at night you know when you go to bed
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and every time a a fire truck or anything went down the road i'd wake up but i guess i've gotten used to it because i don't even hear it anymore
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i suppose you do
 	
 	
 		and uh i just close it out i guess because i don't i don't remember waking up in several years at night when i'd hear a fire truck go by you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		i think they'd probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm am a real sound sleeper though  so that probably wouldn't bother me i'd sleep right through it
 	
 	
 		they'd have to chop down the door and get you out i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah it takes a lot
 	
 	
 		let's see what else is an invasion
 	
 	
 		i had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time  i was mad because those are mine you know they're not
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		well did you have has name all over them
 	
 	
 		no it was a a letter from a girlfriend of mine and i i just i was upset because those are mine and you know i thought he
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that was yours yeah
 	
 	
 		right i thought he'd respect me more than that to look through my things and not trust me so that was upsetting i was mad about that my privacy there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
