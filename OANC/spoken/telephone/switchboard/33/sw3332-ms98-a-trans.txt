 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Doug you want to start
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you don't use any credit cards i don't imagine
 	
 	
 		no of course i use credit cards i have a couple of credit cards and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh use them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you use them a lot
 	
 	
 		well we try not to we're on a pretty strict and tight budget we use the credit cards however
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when we're at a situation where we don't have either the cash or the checkbook handy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or we use credit cards also if we want to get an extended warranty on on an item that we're purchasing so
 	
 	
 		oh well that's an idea that's a thought um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 		yes and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling or out of state or or somewhere where you know they don't take local they don't take out of state checks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so when we're traveling some do you use credit cards often
 	
 	
 		my husband loves them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh we do use them uh
 		we try not to but he he's one who believes in credit cards and he uses them quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well that's that's a good thing because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month and they just pay the minimum required balance
 	
 	
 		he he likes doing that
 		um-hum
 		and that's when you get into expenses
 	
 	
 		yes and you get in over your head
 	
 	
 		it's
 		
 
 		right
 		but
 	
 	
 		it'll uh some people i know also try to use it as float
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where they buy something now and say well i'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale and then i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month when i'm being paid
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		well sometimes you do come on bargains and that and it's really useful
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and some places won't take you know like a personal check or cash even
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but they would take a credit card
 	
 	
 		right
 		how well how are the laws in Pennsylvania uh as as regard well not the laws but the rates
 		credit card rates in Pennsylvania for example down here when you go to a gas station
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you get an extra charge for credit cards
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		than you would by paying for cash are they the same there
 	
 	
 		we yeah we have the same thing up here so we don't deal where they do that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we charge you know we go to places where they don't charge extra some of them charge five cents a gallon even like the gas stations more
 	
 	
 		that's pretty steep
 	
 	
 		and uh we just try to avoid you know
 		the ones that do that we just don't uh go there
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything extra
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		because actually to me
 		credit cards are the same as cash
 		to me they are anyways
 	
 	
 		yes because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase and and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill
 	
 	
 		right
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		are you saying that that way you're stranded not left stranded and high and dry  very good you're you're one of the the good i guess good
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes yeah right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money
 	
 	
 		well i can't say we never have
 		now we have you know at times made payments on our things but we try not to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we try real hard
 	
 	
 		well yeah well  i see that as an advantage to a credit card also
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that you can
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself so i think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		um-hum
 		yeah because sometimes uh there's times when you may maybe couldn't take advantage of something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but with a credit card you can
 	
 	
 		um-hum um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		um
 		do you have uh multiple credit cards
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and do you find that advantageous or
 	
 	
 		well i think we're narrowing it down actually uh
 		uh like i said my husband likes them and we have quite a few but we really get when when you get down to the nitty gritty there's probably three
 		that we use most of the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		we're we're actually in the same boat we like to use three uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		basic credit cards that way we're not confused and we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes to the end of the month
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		do you find
 		that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		once a week twice a week or three times a week
 	
 	
 		well
 		it's not every week but but you do get them they make it very readily available
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes
 	
 	
 		almost too much so
 		but i really i really don't like it the charges they you know
 		we try to limit look look at that also what they charge per year
 	
 	
 		right so the annual fee
 	
 	
 		for to use our money you know  they're charging us to spend our money and i i'm not real crazy about that so we try to look at that also
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yes so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card
 	
 	
 		but
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty three percent
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh based upon what the state will allow
 	
 	
 		um
