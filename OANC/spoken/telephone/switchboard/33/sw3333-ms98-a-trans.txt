 
     		
 	
 		all right i've never done it before so i guess that's all i have to do right i've been called several times you know i push in pushed in my number
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i guess so
 	
 	
 		they kept saying you have the invalid code and then i found out that my new phone wasn't working right so and this this so this the first time i've even done it
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i wonder how long it's gonna be on for
 	
 	
 		i think five minutes is the max
 	
 	
 		oh no i mean this whole thing like for two months or something do you know
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know i'm not really sure
 	
 	
 		yeah okay well back to crime i guess we're supposed to talk about that
 		they say what aspect are you worried about well i think at this point i for one am worried about every aspect
 	
 	
 		well especially uh you since you're in the same metroplex you know there's so much going on here
 	
 	
 		i think the drive by shootings are getting so be so common that's really a something you got to protect yourself from you know
 	
 	
 		well that and in the schools too
 	
 	
 		um-hum God i know
 	
 	
 		starting to put metal detectors in and
 	
 	
 		have they done that in Garland
 	
 	
 		no i not that i'm aware of
 	
 	
 		no um
 	
 	
 		i just heard you know  last week at that one school they started putting them in because there was that one shooting
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		well we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the you know on the school grounds after school
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and then one boy killed himself a few years ago in the in a grade school so you know these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood doesn't seem like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		not at all
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh yeah it's kind of scary to think you send your child to school and you wonder if he's gonna get shot i mean we never had to worry about that before
 	
 	
 		i know i know it's it's it's getting it's been out of hand i think for a while and it just continues to get worse
 	
 	
 		what next
 		right and you know we can't really depend on the police to solve all this they just can't do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent and  and you know how we're gonna bring that back together
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah that's yeah i think i agree i think that's where it stems from is that and um
 		you know you've got a lot of a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children and that may impact it as well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right and
 		i think so and and then there's a drop in uh the training of morals really you know
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		these some of these young kids you read about just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all i think
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't think twice about it
 	
 	
 		i think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals morals you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now or what the what the case is
 	
 	
 		i think it was just rare i really do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my mother well she's like seventy four now or she when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in California
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		and um no i'm the witness
 	
 	
 		himself and her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um that must've been at least fifty years ago or more but the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was on all the papers all over the country for weeks
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		but now you know you would probably even read about it here in Texas
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		it's just you know another  killing
 	
 	
 		well they were i was watching some show the other day and they were talking about uh mass murderers and they  brought up what happened in Killeen here recently and they were saying you know that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		these guys want attention and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper it's on all the newspapers and TVs and and everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		right and lots of their pictures and their life story and everything
 	
 	
 		right and then you get to their life story oh they came from a broken family oh this person had mental problems oh duh duh duh you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right
 		i know how do we go into all these houses and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible
 	
 	
 		i yeah
 	
 	
 		so it that story i just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin well the same thing happened here in Arlington
 		when was it i think it was oh it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah in fact it was on a Hard Copy she was a real attractive blonde girl in in her freshman year of college and some boy she tried to get rid of uh he was like in his twenties remember that yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i remember seeing that i saw that on Hard Copy
 	
 	
 		right right that's uh she my daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School
 	
 	
 		yes
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah can you believe it it's just uh
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to remember he um had her in the car in front of Taco Bueno or something and he just shot them himself and her i remember seeing that on Hard Copy
 	
 	
 		Taco Bueno right uh-huh um-hum right nobody
 		yeah  isn't that weird uh
 	
 	
 		yeah there's just too many crazy people out there these days
 	
 	
 		i know and uh the police are not gonna do anything until they've they have committed some sort of a crime
 	
 	
 		i'm
 	
 	
 		you know he was just begging her on the phone they can't do anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and there are times i've think gee maybe i should give my kids guns
