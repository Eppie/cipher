 		uh i guess i don't know it's the first time i've made a phone call on it
 	
 	
 		oh so you pressed one okay so i guess we're supposed to start talking uh  what kind of books do you read
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		i read uh a lot of Steven King Dean R Koontz uh some Danielle Steel my aunt got me hooked on those
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum so it's mostly all novels  okay
 	
 	
 		so i
 		yeah they're all novels
 		i'll read some of classic too
 	
 	
 		oh like what
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i like The Grapes Of Wrath by Steinbeck an i like um
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i like that i like Steinbeck a lot
 	
 	
 		a A Rose For Emily by Faulkner that's one of my favorite
 	
 	
 		i have never read a lot of Faulkner
 	
 	
 		oh and this  this is more of a play or something that it that it was from that that i saw and i read the book from that
 	
 	
 		oh cool
 	
 	
 		and by the way my name's Bill i'm from North Carolina
 	
 	
 		i'm Doug  i'm from Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		um
 		um i let's see  what kind of books do you like to read
 	
 	
 		um well a bunch of
 		stuff i guess um  fair number of novels but mostly shorter ones and like i don't really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like the you know six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that  right
 	
 	
 		i really have to be in the mood i i read one like maybe once a year of those
 	
 	
 		um-hum no like i like say uh Richard Broudigan a lot um okay he's um
 	
 	
 		i've never read anything by him
 	
 	
 		he's dead now but he was really a pretty amazing writer he wrote books that were like pretty short and
 		pretty easy to read you know like written at a third grade level or whatever but they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny like he wrote Trout Fishing in America
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so that's anyway and um i read a lot of nonfiction books too um let's see
 	
 	
 		i like to read read a lot of nonfiction history when Civil War era and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that kind of thing i i found that real interesting i'm reading The Lion and the Wind right now and that was on TV it was uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		now what's that
 	
 	
 		sometime  during Teddy Roosevelt's time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 		about about American woman that got kidnapped in um
 		Morocco
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh this is when they were having their revolution or whatever and Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and  really portrays him as a kind of a crazy man
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		surprised me i had no idea that he was like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum what how crazy
 	
 	
 		well just like some some uh one quote that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle and it should be a grizzly bear because he liked the to
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		to to hunt grizzly and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		so it was it was i saw the movie and that's what uh made me want to read the book  Candice Bergen was in the movie i'm a real big fan of hers so
 	
 	
 		um-hum  yeah cool see i also read a lot of books about music
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because i'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		i like i like to read some of the philosophy stuff stuff stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum like
 		let's see
 		and even like reading some new age things things that i don't quite believe in like here on my shelf i have a book called Journeys Out of the Body
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that i'm fascinated by that yeah i'm fascinated by that
 	
 	
 		it's all about how to have out of body experiences and all of that um-hum  yep
 	
 	
 		that and and uh even stuff about not like ghost stories but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses i like  i'm kind of a doubting Thomas and i like to read stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		some of it really freaks me out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum  you're right definitely
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i like to read um
 		i like to read some self help books like
 		um i read Dianetics once once i got past all the gibberish on it and
 	
 	
 		uh did you like it
 	
 	
 		it was okay it it it it took me a while to really get into it it didn't help me that much  but uh i think once you're set in your ways you're set in your ways
 	
 	
 		um-hum i see
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um then i one interesting real interesting book i read recently was when i was looking for a job i read How to Get the Job That You Wanted and it it had real good tips in it and
