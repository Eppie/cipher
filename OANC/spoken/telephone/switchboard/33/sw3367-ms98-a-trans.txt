 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what you want to start
 	
 	
 		uh  it it uh it doesn't matter um we're discussing the capital punishment i believe and um
 	
 	
 		right yeah right yeah i i suppose i should of
 	
 	
 		which i am am
 		pro capital punishment except that i don't like the way it's done
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh
 		yeah i i i uh i guess i i hate to see anyone die uh but uh i guess these people that go around and and kill children and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		women and everything else without any remorse uh
 		i don't think they deserve to to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives
 	
 	
 		i i agree i i'm capital the capital punishment is necessary in in many cases but
 		uh the it's not a deterrent um or our jails would not be so full there wouldn't be so many people on Death Row
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think it needs to be something
 		uh uh a throwback to where they did a
 		uh public execution where it's visible
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh something you know not gruesome but but something where where people knew that it was it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people if you committed a certain crime
 		you were going to receive a death penalty and it was going to happen to you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no stays of execution no no loopholes no
 	
 	
 		well and and even even that i don't really know if that would help i think lot of these people do it
 		uh mainly because of of TV
 		and and double double reason mainly they they see it being done on TV and also the fact of of notoriety i mean they become well known they are almost like like a big star
 	
 	
 		notoriety
 		um-hum
 		yes yes but but they they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal they know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that they're going to write a book they're gonna go on talk shows they're gonna that that that's a reward
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh for a heinous crime rather than
 		uh having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		in in complete uh advance of any notoriety
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i i think if they went according to uh the Bible where it does say an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life uh you take a life you give yours
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh uh
 		uh that's for sure  there's exceptions to the rule i mean if if it's an accidental taking then
 		uh
 		you look at that but you know most of these people that
 		down right go right and and do it out of pure pleasure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i don't uh like to see that i guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent
 		it is a deterrent in the in the sense that that person  will never do it again
 	
 	
 		well yes they will it
 	
 	
 		not not not if he's killed he can't do it again
 	
 	
 		oh and it yeah well correct that's correct yes yeah if if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is it is executed yes
 	
 	
 		the death penalty
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but but the the the chances
 		are not
 		great that that will happen
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yet there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah well i i guess i'm also looking at beyond even that i i i guess i
 		been thinking about it and i don't have a definite opinion but uh repeat uh crimes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		maybe not the the more mild ones but you know a more severe ones especially on armed armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people and not just taking the money but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		beating them half to death
 	
 	
 		that right
 	
 	
 		just for pleasure too and
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i i guess you got to look at something like that do they deserve to uh remain on this earth too
 	
 	
 		well you you know you you could carry it uh to that if uh if they are a repeat
 		offender and and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up um
 		you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes and of course uh uh battery or assault or that's not a capital crime so you you wouldn't be able to under our system
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		now China and a few other countries have a little different view of that um you get caught with dope there and you die period
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		there is there is no no appeals there is no
