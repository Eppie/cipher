 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh i guess uh this is a a topic near and dear to my heart since i am a uh am a healthy eater
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i I try to be as well
 	
 	
 		well i'm not uh i there really isn't any kind of particular food that i i don't don't like really and i like a good Italian restaurant or a good uh um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh especially like good prime rib so if it's uh nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that and i live here in uh Rome New York and there are a lot of good restaurants around here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh you're in New York i was gonna there's a place if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib it's called Lawry's like Lawry's seasoning salt and it is absolutely wonderful
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		really
 	
 	
 		and uh we were there a few months ago and it i mean it's kind of pricey well from New York it probably doesn't matter but
 	
 	
 		well no i i'm in upstate New York and it's actually very inexpensive i there's a there's a place um half a mile from me here that uh
 	
 	
 		oh is it okay
 	
 	
 		has uh fantastic prime rib for uh eleven dollars a whole meal you know a potato and salad and soup and the whole whole nine yards so it
 	
 	
 		wow
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well i think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen and it includes you know salad and rolls and oh some other stuff but it is absolutely wonderful it's the best i have ever had
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i was going to this place up the street from me is the best i've ever had so  i'll have to go there when i get there get to Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well yeah well we like uh lots of people down here like Mexican food
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure
 	
 	
 		so um that's i i think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um i'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		no no i'm not into the the don't do the the raw raw fish like that but i do like uh like a seafood bar like a raw raw bar like oysters and things like that uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that they uh i go on i'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business so i uh find myself down in Melbourne Florida every about once once a month once every two months or so and uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		go and hit the the oyster bars down there quite a bit uh i love that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah get fresh seafood down there
 	
 	
 		and um and uh Maryland's great you get the crabs it's like i can't go anywhere where i i where i don't enjoy myself so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah seafood seems to be a little a little bit more expensive than than other types of food
 	
 	
 		that's true but
 	
 	
 		but it sure is good and it's supposed to be good for you
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah it's really strange that that that seafood is so expensive because when you in reality uh
 		uh i say that the oceans have the greatest resource resource of food on the planet and yet we haven't as human beings haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically  so
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		we've managed to uh figure out how to get at just about everything else but uh but not uh not seafood
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh do you like uh spicy foods or
 	
 	
 		what
 		yeah yeah i like yeah i'd make a a wicked chili and uh like around here the big spicy thing is like uh buffalo wings
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so uh  people they you know you go out to get the chicken wings and those are really hot and the hotter the better and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well we uh we like spicy food down here especially uh the hot sauce Picante sauce or salsa whatever y'all call it and uh we we sure go through a lot of that
 	
 	
 		right
 		sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i like it hot but i don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		my my generally my my scalp will start i can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot it's like weirdest weirdest sensation almost like a tingling but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know but uh yeah well there isn't isn't too much in the way of restaurants that i don't like things that are kind of oddball like uh Thai cuisine i i never been
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really fond of that stuff you talk about spicy that'll that'll literally blow your head off it's so hot  and i can handle just about any kind of food without uh um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well but that that stuff is goes one notch beyond uh my tolerances so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		although i guess on this topic i  talk about the uh service in a restaurant is always nice though too that's one thing what's that yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and and the price and the price make you wanna come back
 	
 	
 		well i find that lately that so many people are working you know they're working waitressing jobs or waiter
