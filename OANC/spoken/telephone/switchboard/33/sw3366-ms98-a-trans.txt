 		that you've enjoyed
 	
 	
 		i haven't read much lately i've always reading is one of my favorite things but somehow the last few months i just haven't read i've read more magazines than books it's which is most unusual for me but
 		um have you read anything lately
 	
 	
 		not real lately when they came up with this topic i thought gee i read a lot of books and now i thought what have i read lately  um
 	
 	
 		why what whoa i can't i know i read a bunch a few months back but i can't remember the titles oh
 	
 	
 		oh isn't that funny i will have to say
 	
 	
 		i'd have to go look around my room for the books i've read and they're still stacked there
 	
 	
 		oh well it seems like i've have read a lot of children's books lately  to my my kids and things like that but
 	
 	
 		well now i have too
 		well i have grandchildren and uh the oldest is two but he you know loves books so so i have read more of those myself
 	
 	
 		oh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		lately i did buy the sequel to uh Gone With the Wind the other day
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i've read the first chapter and and i thought it was real good and i have not even picked it back up you know and Gone With the Wind is my all time
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		favorite book you know so you would have thought i'd a had the whole thing read by now
 	
 	
 		oh
 		is it by the same author
 	
 	
 		no uh no see Margaret Mitchell died uh oh maybe ten years after she wrote Gone With the Wind and she that's the only book she ever wrote
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh so the heirs to her estate after fifty years picked this Alexander Ripley i think is her name to write the sequel which she did and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that may that may be the reason you can't get into it as as much oh
 	
 	
 		no no it it it was very good it it brought all those characters back to life i just i just well i don't know i've just been busy and i just haven't read
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where i've i used to find time
 	
 	
 		yeah i yeah you know if i get reading a book i like to just close the door and just read you know and even stay up really late at night and and just stay into it until i finish uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		i used to be that way but
 	
 	
 		yeah sometimes it's hard to do that with our lives
 	
 	
 		well i get well i'm fifty three and i you know i just get sleepy and i go to bed early so where i used to do that years ago i don't anymore and i do i work my husband's an accountant and we moved our office home about two years ago
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i work at home but i have a lot of work to do you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh then when i'm not doing that like i have my grandkids a lot because my daughter travels and she has a twenty month and then a four month
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that's why we're going to Plano today that's where we pick them up at day care
 	
 	
 		i see
 		oh i see well some of the books that i have read um that i really enjoyed getting into was um the one Ellen Drury
 		books you know Advice and Consent and have you ever read any of those
 	
 	
 		now is that like a classic
 	
 	
 		it really is um
 	
 	
 		i mean i mean written quite a ways back that you like maybe read in high school or something or am i thinking of a different one with that name
 	
 	
 		it's been around awhile but it's not you know it's not from the eighteen hundreds or anything this is it's a book um
 		it's written in the nineteen hundreds and it's written uh about what goes on in Washington you know in the Senate and the House and
 	
 	
 		oh no that's not what i was thinking of
 	
 	
 		the President and everything and um it really gets into
 		kind of the wheeling and dealing type thing and it's just it gets really fascinating i didn't think something like that would catch my interest but uh the way it's written and everything it is excellent it just really uh it's well worth reading
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 		i'll be darn
 		okay well i sure wish i could remember what i've read so i could tell you something i did read that oh gosh

 		now i have seen that what is that about
 	
 	
 		that's just real cute it's um it's just got a lot of ideas in it about basic things you know that we do and um
 		you know things that you learn in kindergarten that that really apply to your life um there's one little section in there that that talks about um
