 		i have a i had a son he's now gone from the home that was a pet animal lover
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so at one point i had a snake
 		skunk dog and cat running loose in the house
 	
 	
 		wow  the um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do the skunk uh was that kind of like a cat to have around the house
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah so it
 	
 	
 		it was litter trained and we had it perfumed and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was very aggressive but all the all three of them dog cat and
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		skunk used to chase each other all through the house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory
 	
 	
 		the skunk
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		being the sofa and the
 		blanket on the sofa nobody came near it when he was there
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh
 		um
 		i had i had a dog one time and uh he chased after a after a skunk and got sprayed so we had to uh we had to give him a tomato tomato juice bath
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh and get him cleaned up
 	
 	
 		yeah they um
 		ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad
 		and try to perfume them but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the glands had been removed so
 	
 	
 		right but i suppose it was still in the instinct of them to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to back off and
 		get ready
 		
  
 	
 	
 		one other question we had is why do you have pets
 	
 	
 		yeah why i don't know i i think they're kind of nice to have they're kind of i don't know just relaxing to
 		i don't know to pet and to
 		i don't know when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that
 		just kind of enjoyable to you know
 		have like i don't know something giving you some affection
 		as well what what do you think
 	
 	
 		yeah i always said if i died well i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog  that'd be the best way to be
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 		yeah
 		um do you like big dogs or or little dogs
 	
 	
 		well we had a German Shepherd and he had dysplasia
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		so when he died we got a little one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but our Shepherd was almost thirteen years old and it just you know it was almost cruel
 	
 	
 		um-hum almost cruel for him to to walk
 	
 	
 		because yeah he just he couldn't get up he couldn't walk so he was a hundred and twenty pounds so it was a chore
 	
 	
 		wow yeah
 	
 	
 		so we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened it would be easier to carry
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah it was something
 	
 	
 		and then we've had three cats in our married life
 		and we've got a calico now
 	
 	
 		yeah we've got a calico cat too yeah yeah she's the she's the nice one
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yeah we um  we used to live in an apartment and like our cats never went outside but um
 		the neighbors used to let their dogs out and our neighbors were i don't know kind of slimy and um
 		our cats wound up getting fleas um from the apartment that we were in
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so we had to we had to flea bath them and that was uh that was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all
 	
 	
 		yeah well don't even talk to me i when i was single  i had gone away for the weekend and my husband then fiance was to keep my cat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he let her out and my house was loaded with fleas i mean you walked in and your legs were just black
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and we had such a time and never got the cat back
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah i found it you know in the street
