 
     		
 	
 		well what i believe is one of the major problems uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		discipline and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh i agree with that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh when i went to school i know i was scared to death
 	
 	
 		you were
 	
 	
 		about being disciplined and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school it's just totally different
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know you just you did not see i did not see anybody in my classrooms when i was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah from what i understand they act up pretty bad
 	
 	
 		yeah  that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		what uh grade is your daughter in
 	
 	
 		my my daughter's in the um fourth grade and um there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		the classroom where the teacher cannot teach and when i went to school that just wasn't put up with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh no huh-uh they always had paddle in our school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well they they they just don't do that anymore the the school system's afraid of getting sued and um
 	
 	
 		i know
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure because of things like that and i also believe we don't
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards putting toward public schools
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that can solve some of our
 		problems
 	
 	
 		yeah wasn't that what part of the lottery's gonna go for if we approve it uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yes  supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for and you know we'll just have to wait and see whether that's proved or not you know i don't know your feelings toward that i guess we shouldn't get into that but um  and what else um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i have heard stories um from other parents that i know of when their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no really ooh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh i've i've heard some horrible horrible stories about high school high school teachers and you know to be more be more careful of the teachers that we place in our schools
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum hm
 	
 	
 		um that's basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school systems i think with what they have to work with i think they're doing a pretty good job right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i do too i think they're doing real good job
 	
 	
 		uh-huh so
 	
 	
 		but then what do i know i don't have any kids  no none at all
 	
 	
 		you don't have any children in school you don't have any kids  yeah okay so this is probably a real hard subject for you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  so
 	
 	
 		yeah  okay well i guess um we can discontinue our call now it was a joy in talking with you
 	
 	
 		okay well it's good talking to you too we'll see you bye-bye
