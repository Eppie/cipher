 
     		
 	
 		okay i'll let you start this time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well how much do you like lawn and garden work
 	
 	
 		well ah even though it's totally out of my ah my degree training i've been working as as in the horticultural
 		aspect uh for the last  you i don't know fifteen twenty years so uh i'm well i work for the state as as a groundskeepers
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh for goodness sakes what do you do
 		uh-huh
 		well that's interesting um so at this time of the year are you doing much garden work
 	
 	
 		no mostly snow removal  which we've had a lot of
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know i i guess uh growing up on the farm and and that i i've always had a big interest uh i have a uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		when i have an area to do i i always had a big garden and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		enjoy working on lawns and and everything
 	
 	
 		well  i love to work outside really and i enjoy flowers and stuff i don't do a whole lot of it um at this exact point in my life um because i have two teenage boys
 		and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i still take care of the yeah flower beds and things like that
 		i was even planning to go out and to uh dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here but you know were planted in the ground since last spring
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me and lo and behold about
 		five days ago we had a freeze down to about
 		oh twenty three degrees or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so the hibiscus hibiscus plants no longer exist and i really feel bad about it it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty five years that these were cuttings off of you know
 	
 	
 		oh that's terrible twenty three degree
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		they're all gone at this point gardening in Texas is really interesting though i grew up in Illinois
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um  Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry
 		why you know everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has land um
 		a watering system
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so with that why our lawns do stay um
 		you know pretty nice all summer if you water but in the winter we have Bermuda grass
 	
 	
 		huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		and  and i just think it's ugly  when i go back home to my
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		parents in Illinois in the winter you know and their grass is
 		fairly green
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's one one aspect of a lot of those grasses they go dormant
 		yeah i think the ah Saint Augustine and uh  centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there yeah those two
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum  yeah some people have i think it's fescue
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that stays green all winter
 		but they really have a heck of a time
 		keeping it going in the middle of the summer
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		they have to water an incredible amount
 		but um those lawn those lawns look nice during the winter but you know they almost stick out like a sore
 		i guess not a sore thumb a pretty thumb but you know
 		when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except for one you know it's sort of like well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i know my folks live uh in Arizona there and uh you know they just grow rocks and and stuff there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well and that's their gardening there so uh i guess as long as you can have ah some grass there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i know i was uh in uh
 		Houston and i i was working for a company once and we were taking care of lawns out there and uh that particular year they had just tons of rain it was raining continuously so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then i know with all that moisture a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems
 	
 	
 		yes that's true yeah Houston is a a lot um a lot wetter than than Dallas Dallas area that's where Plano is
 		and um  and just humidity
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know just all the time it's an awfully lot more humid
 	
 	
 		are are you uh able to get uh sometimes a double crops of of certain things in your garden uh
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh i think people do yeah i don't have a vegetable garden haven't for
 		i guess i never have here actually but um  but yes uh-huh i'll
 		we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio
