 
     		
 	
 		all right what's your favorite show
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i was just trying to think when they called i didn't have as much time to prepare for this as i did some of the others um i love watching some of the uh new new shows basically
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we uh took we subscribe to CNN and we took that and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during any kind of thing like the earthquake and i have gotten stuck on a lot of this the news shows and the stuff that comes on that
 		that it you know like the uh at night the discussion talk shows and things and we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		we have little ones uh we do let them watch 911 and we think that's kind of informative to teach them how to handle things in situations
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it really is
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what do you watch
 	
 	
 		i watch just about anything but not a lot of TV i mean i'll watch you know maybe a little while when i first get home in the evening
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i usually watch you know the news and then i'll watch that Hard Copy or
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's the same things we do
 	
 	
 		or that kind of thing you know and i like the 911 and Unsolved Mysteries and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that kind that's the kind i like really more than the sitcoms i haven't gotten into many of those
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		now i do like my husband is really crazy about Evening Shade that comes on on Monday evening
 	
 	
 		i have heard that's real good
 	
 	
 		and i uh
 	
 	
 		that's Burt Reynolds isn't it yeah i've heard that
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i've got to where every Monday i rush around so i could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny
 	
 	
 		now someone told me that and also uh i i meant to be trying to pick up on Murphy Brown because they said that that was really good this season
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well his favorite night's Monday night so we've got to where we'll sit and watch it on Monday night because that and then that uh oh i can't even think of the name of it
 	
 	
 		you've got it  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like i say i'm not
 	
 	
 		Designing Women is on that night too
 	
 	
 		yeah and the one with the the sergeant
 		that married the woman with the kids Sergeant McGillis
 	
 	
 		hm i don't even know
 	
 	
 		Sergeant uh Major Major Dad
 	
 	
 		oh okay now i we've never even seen that
 	
 	
 		yeah that comes on right after uh the Evening Shade and then Murphy Brown and Designing Women
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we always he watches that and i kind of sit i watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others as i can
 	
 	
 		on the other  well you know on Friday nights especially we like to watch 20/20  or um it's kind of a competition on Thursdays between Prime Time and Knots Landing
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh we used to like Knots Landing a lot oh excuse me just a minute  the money's right there on the
 	
 	
 		well you can't hardly watch Knots Landing with the little kids around though
 	
 	
 		oh i know that's the thing and so we  um-hum well they are in fact on weeknights they're in bed by eight but we've just gotten anymore to where we just keep it off
 	
 	
 		except they's probably are in bed by nine
 		did you get your pizza taken care of
 	
 	
 		yeah he's gone to get it thank you um but i was but i was trying to say on Saturdays there's absolutely nothing and that's the day my husband wants to do straight sports
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well do you know i have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that i've really liked and that's Sisters have you watched that
 	
 	
 		no but i saw that advertised today and it sounds like it's not fluff it sounds like it's good
 	
 	
 		it's really you know it's really pretty good i mean it's kind of like you know um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		soap opera i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what they said it was kind of a little more drama to it
 	
 	
 		but it's so so far it i've watched it about three times now and it's really held my attention it's been pretty good some pretty good acting
 	
 	
 		well and
 		and another one now that it's getting darker and you're wanting to cocoon more that they said is excellent is the I'll Fly Away and Brooklyn Bridge some of these that are nostalgic
 	
 	
 		now i watched Brooklyn Bridge this week for the first time but i haven't i did i like it
 	
 	
 		did you like it
 		did you well they said that one and I'll Fly Away are really quality you know  and i haven't seen it either i think what i need to do is kind of read to see what's on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then i get my bath  it's you know it's almost too late to start something new
 	
 	
 		now i haven't seen i'll Fly Away yet
 		um-hum
 		it's nearly too late for TV that's the way i am i get in from work and i'm tired and i sit and watch for a few minutes then i have to get up and do dinner and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for the weekend nights  so it's like we kind of tuned out of our TV
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		that's us if we're home on the weekend we always watch videos so
 	
 	
 		yeah well we do too
 	
 	
 		but there are some good shows on i i really probably should watch more of them than i do but i like i don't know i i'm always in to making things and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't know yeah there's a lot more to do with with your time when you get into it
 	
 	
 		and i don't just spend all my time and i my husband now he sits and watch TV constantly
 	
 	
 		um-hum well my my sister and them and her husband do on weekends they don't have children yet and they just turn it on when they walk in they turn it off when they leave
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so they're used to that too
 	
 	
 		i can be around here for hours by myself and never have it on
 	
 	
 		yeah i understand same here
 	
 	
 		but uh but there are some really good new shows that i have enjoyed and i'll have to watch that I'll Fly Away this week
 	
 	
 		yeah it's real good and of course in the afternoons if i get in from work in time i watch Oprah some of those you know talk shows i like her okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i never get in in time for any of those so
 	
 	
 		yeah
