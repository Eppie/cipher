 
     		
 	
 		um i think we can have honest government what do you think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think there are honest people in our government i think it's uh
 		and we do have some checks and balances to keep it honest but i think it's always a real challenge to um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		make sure that we have people in there that we can count on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to be honest
 	
 	
 		well
 		i've thought about the politicians that go in and you know they say none of them are honest but i think they're honest when they go in they just keep
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		facing these challenges and not all of them respond favorably to them
 	
 	
 		yeah i think there are and have been some things that have been done to maybe
 		make things better you know one thing is the opportunity on our income tax to um allow certain donations
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to uh be made because a a lot of times i think you know people anybody that runs for a political office has got to either be independently wealthy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or they've got to be beholding to somebody to help them
 	
 	
 		yeah some special interest group
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and so you know i think  if if there were ways that we could get away from that and let just the common man be able to run
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for office that that
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah and of course he runs into a problem he may not can support the two homes and all of the other things even though they have a high salary
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		it's just uh i think public service was originally meant for public service but it it's gotten to where it's kind of rather hard to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		as public service you know
 		they need uh money to operate on and this and that and feed their family and put their kids in college just like everybody else does
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and that puts stress
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well my husband has um held public office for a while and not a paid  public office i might add  and uh  if
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 		that's public service
 	
 	
 		yeah that's more public service i guess than public office and it's been a real eye-opener to us course i feel that he's completely honest and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 		yes
 	
 	
 		what all and there have people been people that have said
 		you know that they
 		how much is he being paid and all this kind of stuff to to do things and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		you always have people throwing stones don't you
 	
 	
 		yeah well obviously if they ever looked at our house or  our car or whatever they would know he's not getting paid anything but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well uh
 		i guess that that uh it's it's the way people perceive and they perceive from their own wants too sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah they want somebody else in so they've got to find something wrong with whoever's there
 	
 	
 		yeah that's probably true too
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but at the same time you know when i go to the polls to vote
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um i always  am real nervous about who i'm voting for even if i have studied the issues and heard what people have had to say and everything because
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um you don't know really know that person you know and you don't know even if what they say is what they're gonna do and what their real feelings are on a lot of things i mean
 	
 	
 		no you don't
 		um-hum
 		well sometimes they don't know that what they say is what they gonna do
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		and depends on the situation and that makes it very difficult
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess that's a real problem you know i i i don't know how we solve that one because i'm not sure that you can ever especially the the higher up you go you know like a senator or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		congressman or something like that i don't know how you would ever get to know any of those people well enough to say you know i know this man on a personal basis i know he has integrity and i know he
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		and to go by voting records and that isn't always right
 	
 	
 		yeah or or just read the League of Women Voters answers that they give or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's sometimes you just don't know
 	
 	
 		no i just uh
 		kind of do the best you can isn't it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah well what do you think about um um the legality or making it illegal to do certain things do you think that helps
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		calling them accountable from a a law standpoint
 	
 	
 		well that would be nice if we could do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i know uh some of them the Senate Ethics Committee is trying to do that
 		but uh it's really strange that they find someone totally guilty of something and then they go back and talk to their constituency and i'm thinking about one in particular
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh then the constituency says oh well he's honest and we want him you know
 	
 	
 		oh i can think of one like that also  just blows your mind doesn't it oh think so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm sure we both can
 		yeah it sure does and then they've proved that he's lined his pockets and everything else
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but i
