 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh what uh kind of clothing do you have to wear for work
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh i bear a variety uh
 		i'm a supervisor out at TI so i wear anything from uh
 		jeans and uh a sport shirt to a you know
 		dress slacks or dress shirt
 		no coat and tie thanks goodness
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't like those much myself
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		uh it's it's pretty casual uh
 		i usually uh
 		usually wear something like jeans sneakers
 		uh
 	
 	
 		kind of work you do
 	
 	
 		um i do engineering uh using uh computer operated and grading machines
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and some of it so some of
 	
 	
 		i guess that would be pretty casual
 	
 	
 		yeah some of it's uh i mean i don't have to see customers or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but some of it's a little bit dirty you know you got all this machinery and stuff so you don't really want to be
 		wearing your
 		best stuff for that
 	
 	
 		well i was in the uh retail business for
 		about fifteen years so i uh
 		had my fill of coat and ties
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 		fifteen years
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		were were you supervising then too
 	
 	
 		i was uh store manager for Kinney shoes
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i guess you'd say uh
 		supervisor
 	
 	
 		um some anyway yeah
 	
 	
 		not a topic you can get into very deep is it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		so let's see where where did you you said you're in Houston
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you don't have to dress very warmly i suppose
 	
 	
 		no we uh even this this year particular was real warm uh it didn't hardly get cold
 		not to wear a coat almost
 	
 	
 		really how how cold did it get
 	
 	
 		uh i don't we didn't even have a freeze i don't believe got down
 		about thirty
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		below thirties is about the worst it did that i can remember
 		not very often at that
 	
 	
 		you say you have to wear a tie or no
 	
 	
 		no i don't huh-uh
 	
 	
 		ah that's good
 	
 	
 		fortunately
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		guess that can be pretty hot too
 	
 	
 		what'd you think about that thing out in LA
 	
 	
 		which thing  they've got more than one
 	
 	
 		that verdict they came up with
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		everybody's talking about that here
 	
 	
 		really yeah i guess it's uh
 		created quite a stir
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		rioting and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah i hear there's some uh
 		smaller amount going on in Atlanta too
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i hadn't uh hadn't been paying that close attention to the news i guess i ought to tune in tonight
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and what do you think about it
 		you think he was uh
 		you think it was a good
 		verdict or
 	
 	
 		yeah they uh acquitted the cops that supposed that
 		beat him up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		certainly by looking at the video tape it didn't seem
 		all that uh  reasonable but
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's what surprised everybody was the fact they let them off after looking at the tape
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		course i guess there was a lot more uh to it
 	
 	
 		yeah must've been i guess
 		only saw you know a small part of the
 		the story
 		that is that what you're uh seeing on the TV now or
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		is is that on the TV now why you mentioned it or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's been on there i was listening to it on a talk show on the way home from work tonight
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yep
