 
     		
 	
 		are you in the middle of anything
 	
 	
 		uh no i'm not in the middle of anything i've just about the last thing i did about maybe
 		oh close to a year ago now i guess i'd i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house
 		so i guess that was yeah that was that was fairly large undertaking a a it's it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house
 	
 	
 		the whole thing
 		did the framing and all
 	
 	
 		oh we did it all except for the sheetrocking that was the only thing we didn't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that we don't we we weren't sure how to do that
 	
 	
 		huh
 		maybe you and i should get together because when i had my last big project i had the contractor do the framing and i did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the exact opposite we did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the
 		put all the interior walls up we just didn't do any of the Sheetrock wall work and that's it because you have you know get those joints to go together and
 		and whatever you have to put in there to get the Sheetrock to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that i didn't we didn't know a thing about any of that and so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my wife wishes i hadn't done that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's it looked very hard to do so we figured well just i don't think we could do it and make it look professional so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living but
 	
 	
 		i think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy
 	
 	
 		probably so and i'd we'd never done it so we just left it alone but that's i guess so i'm only twenty one so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i my my vast experience of of home home owner's knowledge is not very much so it's just what i have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents so
 	
 	
 		did you you framed it in frame uh on on you framed in new square footage or was it stuff that was already uh enclosed brand new so you
 	
 	
 		it was brand new we started with the the backyard and turned it into part of the house so it was
 	
 	
 		and you knew how you knew how to do the framing
 	
 	
 		um well my dad knew how to do most of it you know he
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he had we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it i don't know he well he did all the flooring himself he put the whole the whole floor in and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there and then we were put us like a
 		not not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that after we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less it's not you know it's not enclosed it's just
 		somewhere to drive another car to to park and it's
 	
 	
 		do do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground
 	
 	
 		uh it's off the ground
 	
 	
 		on the piers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it's on about uh twenty two inch piers something like that
 	
 	
 		did
 		you had those poured or you did them yourself
 	
 	
 		so uh no those are those are we did those ourselves
 	
 	
 		you just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah exactly so it's
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well the last thing i did completely myself was an outside deck which i was pretty proud of
 	
 	
 		yeah those are those are we'd done i've done one i helped somebody do one of those before those are those are you know you can buy them in kits but we didn't do that way but it's yeah
 	
 	
 		no i designed it from scratch and did a pretty did a pretty good job those are nice though they're pretty forgiving you know you can always tear stuff out and redo it it's a
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that is not near like building a house or anything but yeah those are nice especially when you get done you got something
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know i don't know i like them you just sit out on the on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've
 		i built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and uh a backrest and all that stuff i'm
 	
 	
 		yeah that sounds nice all done by yourself huh designed
 	
 	
 		yeah we had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes so we could pour concrete and support it with a a nice firm four by four posts and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then the rest of it i just did a a contractor friend helped me uh with some of the um foundation work but uh it's pretty so it was about four or five hundred square feet the same size as the addition that i just put on so
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a pretty that's a good size deck
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh not that expensive i think it will cost me three dollars a square foot and uh you know it no less than that cost cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together
 	
 	
 		so yeah that's
 		yeah that's right
 		yeah that's good that's not bad at all you didn't have to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the the wood man it's it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know to get to get good lumber it costs i don't know about Dallas but around even in this little town it's it's not cheap at all i was surprised
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'd be surprised if it wasn't uh cheaper where you are well yeah it probably comes from where you are
 	
 	
 		it's probably more there
 		yeah that that it probably does i i don't not sure but
 	
 	
 		most
 		
 
 		when i drive through that area that's all i see is
 	
 	
 		yeah it's nothing but woods up here down here
 	
 	
 		pressure treated pressure treated lumber yards yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well i don't i haven't i mean i haven't i used to live in Dallas in Arlington actually and but that was just when i was a kid so i don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's i don't know we're a college town so that doesn't help us out any because we we have gas is a dollar twelve dollar twelve a gallon so that's probably about what you're paying so
 	
 	
 		right East Texas
 		huh
 		yeah my current project is a walkway which i'm building around the house and out to the backyard to um you know
 		digging it out and laying sand and putting uh pavers on top of that so that's a a lot easier
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you got something going all the time
