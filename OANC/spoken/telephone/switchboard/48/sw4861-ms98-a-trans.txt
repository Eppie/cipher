 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what do you think
 	
 	
 		well i think AIDS research should be funded more than it's currently being funded i think that
 		uh people including i mean mostly the government but also you know a lot of Americans i think that it's a disease of of a certain population i meaning um homosexuals and and uh intravenous drug users
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		in fact it is very much a a normal person's uh disease as well i think that we should fund much more
 	
 	
 		sure
 		right i think i i agree with that to a certain degree
 		um certainly on an absolute scale it should be i i think it should be funded more
 		on a relative scale um looking at it in comparison with other
 		problems and no it's not a big environment
 		i'm not so sure about that however
 		um yeah you're right definitely there's there's a definite um stigma out there that yeah it's it's it's limited exclusive to intravenous drugs users and homosexuals and um blacks or whatever
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's not that's not the case anymore it may have started out that way even though there's there's still no proof of that
 		actually the most recent
 		um the that i've gotten is they're starting to look at um
 		well it started over in Africa they're starting to look at
 		i believe
 		but believe it of monkey
 	
 	
 		yeah  the  monkey i think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah there was some kind of research going on
 		and i can't remember what the exact uh gist of it was but something they hadn't considered before and it's like they now they're trying to go way back to the original
 		first outbreaks of it to see if they can uh nail down what  exactly it was
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well you know you have you have a point about you know where there's other issues that that need a lot of funding too  sure that is true
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh there's a lot of things that are funded and a lot of waste that can be redirected too  i think that that again that uh
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know AIDS is is something that has to be dealt with by every person um and and not just in
 		understanding that it's you know can affect uh everyone
 		but in acting um in a uh you know sensible way to avoid uh the spread of this disease
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum well i i agree with that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um the point i i wanted to make was just strictly the environment like right now they say we've lost forty percent of the ozone layer just last year
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		in in selected in selected spots and that's really becoming a really big problem but that's not to down play the importance of AIDS research you know
 	
 	
 		sure
 		right right
 	
 	
 		um when you think about that importance you also have to consider that uh
 		not only is AIDS good in and of it's own but it also uh has a lot to deal with
 		um cancer and with mononucleosis and all the all the various diseases that affect the T cell from a and the and the when the white cells of the immune system because all fairly interrelated
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i think research on AIDS would benefit all that stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah good point um i i think more often should go into you know AIDS uh education
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know commercials you know public service commercials um schools
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		things like that
 	
 	
 		but it seems a lot like they're almost covering it up at this point
 	
 	
 		yeah which is ridiculous
 	
 	
 		you you you really don't see a lot out there
 	
 	
 		it's like coming up with  plague you know no it's not happening
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh disregard the you know  one out of two people dropping dead next to you you know
 	
 	
 		right you know that's that's for sure i i like i said i go to school at UCF in Florida
 		and actually that kind of hits home because that Kimberly Begajah that had AIDS
 		uh and died from it she went to a dentist in Stewart Florida that's where she got it
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and Stewart's like three hours away from where i go to school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right people i hear a lot more in local news about it
 	
 	
 		uh more than that i had a couple of friends who went to that dentist
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah and they were definitely sweating bullets there for a while um and found out that they they were negative you know they didn't have any problems but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know boy talk about making you think twice before you go to the dentist
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or any health care practitioner at this point
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so
 	
 	
 		yeah because they really the last article i read on that they still hadn't figured out how she could've gotten it from him
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because he he as far as they could tell he sterilized the equipment he used gloves he did all the the proper precautions
 		um asides from telling his patients that he had AIDS
 		um but still that didn't make any difference they still got it so they they're not real sure how that how that worked
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah i'm i'm a lot more cautious of that but
