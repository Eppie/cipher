 		well um at my uh workplace they are we have uh places for aluminum cans and we have uh everybody's been issued a separate trash can for uh
 		recyclable recyclable paper let's let's see them get that word straight uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as far as the community goes uh it's pretty much voluntary nothing's been done um i don't where i live i live in an unincorporated area
 		and we don't have any uh we have just private uh garbage services and uh
 		uh as far as i'm concerned i i guess i should do it but being lazy i don't if if somebody made it easy for me to separate my trash and pick it up i would more than gladly participate  uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i it it is it is to some degree inconvenient i'd have to say that
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh around here they've given us mine already got run over um it it  looks sort of like a milk crate a little blue milk milk crate and i have two kids
 		and it's not big enough it's it's kind of it's kind of silly and what you do is you put out paper like paper bags and newspaper and cardboard
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that you put separately and you also put out in this little ridiculous container any cans or bottles you have you know like your Campbell soup cans and your milk cartons and that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and then the rest you can just you throw out and the town picks it up
 		i've heard of communities where you have to separate your garbage and then put what's left in a clear plastic ga bag so they can kind of look and see if you're throwing out what you shouldn't i thought that was pretty amusing
 	
 	
 		have the garbage police looking after you i guess
 	
 	
 		i imagine i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh well i used to live in California and um just before i left they were um some communities were making that uh mandatory and uh um
 		fortunately i was in a i was in an apartment complex and for some reason we just threw everything in the dumpster that was all right
 	
 	
 		well you know it's funny we just got back from a trip to California visiting some friends uh near San Francisco and San Jose and we'd see these signs on the road that said garbage pickup two exits down or something
 		the apartment for the apartment dwellers they didn't make it easy to recycle at all what they did was um you would bring it to this garbage place that they designated
 		and the Lions Club or you know some community organization would do you the favor of picking it up from there you really had to go out of your way to recycle
 	
 	
 		yeah you know and most people probably don't wanna carry a couple of bags worth of garbage in their car a few miles uh i mean it's all it's a good idea we should all do it uh but
 		um if it were from a practical viewpoint from a selfish viewpoint if communities made it easy and convenient for you to do it they would have a lot more participation in my opinion
 	
 	
 		well around here i it's not too bad because on Tuesdays you put out your paper and your cans and and plastic things and they go away so that i mean that's not too tough to put that at the end of your driveway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh my friends in California have this special garbage fill where they collect all their soda cans and they kind of leave it near the dumpster knowing that the neighborhood kids will grab them because they can sell them or something for recycling
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		gee you haven't
 	
 	
 		so they just leave it out for the vultures to take
 	
 	
 		gee kids around here i don't think would pay well wouldn't pay any attention to it they'd the dogs would get to it before they would i would imagine
 	
 	
 		oh well the soda cans where i live are good for a nickel a piece
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so if you bring them to the local supermarket they have these can crushers and you know you throw all the cans in one at a time it takes time a lot of time and uh you push a button and you get a nickel for every can because someone you had to pay a deposit on it when you bought it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you find these old old men and these bag people collecting all these things and hauling them in in big garbage bags and they just like take up one of these machines to to get you know couple of money uh bucks for beer or something
 	
 	
 		is that a city or state law that uh requires it to be recycled or
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a state well New York state does it and i know Vermont a lot of the eastern states do it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so you get a lot of old people one old fellow had crates of beer he made friends with a bartender a bartender at some bar and he gets all the beer bottles because the guy can't be bothered with it
 		and he said he bought himself i said that's pretty heavy for you isn't it and he says well i just bought myself an old station wagon to cart you know this is a real business for him he's making big bucks
 	
 	
 		gee well i i guess if you can buy in bulk it  so to speak
 	
 	
 		well i guess at a nickel a shot if these people are retired and they've got nothing better to do i mean they can come away with ten fifteen dollars at a haul i guess
 	
 	
 		well i bet that's resulted in uh it it would seem to me that's resulted in some cleaner highways i would imagine
 	
 	
 		well you you do find people picking through the garbage pails at the beach you know my own kids have been guilty of that till they found that the bees were attracted to the Coke cans and that was the end of that
 	
 	
 		surprise surprise
 	
 	
 		i think it's a fair you know for an eight year old to get three dollars it's like wow
 	
 	
 		gee well that's uh well that you know a state law like that would probably encourage people down here uh to do it uh i mean i i don't know
