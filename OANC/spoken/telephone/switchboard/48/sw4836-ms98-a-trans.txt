 
     		
 	
 		you wanna start or you want me to start
 	
 	
 		well go ahead if you're
 	
 	
 		okay  personal interests in computers basically nowadays it seems like you can't get by without one everywhere i go it's got some kind of computer interface like pressing on keyboards
 		uh pressing in personal identification numbers all the ATM machines things like that i personally don't own one because i can't afford one
 		uh every time you look in a friend's houses and they show you their computers and all the knickknacks they have it seems like they go from their basic computer to all these peripheral devices like uh modems and
 		fancy printers or lazy printers and fax machines and games that they like to play course i i was impressed by some of the games they have like flight simular game simulator for the different aircraft
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's uh  actually you might guess you could say even more than just a game it's uh
 		similar to the one they use at uh for training
 	
 	
 		very close to it i understand
 		except for the bouncing around it
 	
 	
 		well i have a i just got a i used to use a TI PC at work now i just got a 386
 		uh computer PC
 	
 	
 		you using it mostly for spreadsheets or do you use it for like word processing
 	
 	
 		uh  well i use it uh
 		in my business i have to uh tie into the mainframe and also into a uh minicomputer a 990
 		so i use a terminal emulation in uh talking to other computers plus word processing i do quite a bit of that
 		and it's uh that's supposed one of the features of the
 		the new one the 386 it's got Windows on it and so you can toggle back and forth between uh applications and you know get a
 		get a lot quicker in and out
 		used to be you had to log off  then log back on the other application
 	
 	
 		yeah i use a Z248 286 at work but it's basically to tie into the communications network
 		then through our communications network we go to our mainframe on the base there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and use the Unix operating systems
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		use their VI editor and we use um read on line news through it
 		and we also have terminal emulations through IBM thirty two seventy eight
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and  i don't know i just don't i don't even use the hard disk drive to to copy any floppy disks or anything like that i just basically use it for a
 		a window into there to the Unix world
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah uh
 		we're supposed to be getting a fifteen hundred minicomputer pretty soon
 	
 	
 		uh is that IBM or is that an IBM type
 	
 	
 		replace our 990 huh
 		uh no it's a TI made 1500 it's a a minicomputer
 		uh it's a newer version of the nine ninety which is one they had
 		it uses uh Unix as one of the operating systems
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i'm familiar with Unix commands like um copying files and compressing them things like that i just have a fun time using their mainframe at the base but
 	
 	
 		well Unix to me i mean uh that System Five i mean that's pretty  looks pretty uh user unfriendly
 	
 	
 		it's like a different language all right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it seems like they sure uh
 		i got a lot of stuff to learn i haven't used it that much so
 	
 	
 		yeah we can use System Five or we can use um C shell
 		you know i like um i favor C shell over the other
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think i think most of our users like Bourne shell because they were trained in it and they just don't wanna learn something different
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that uh that's a powerful force  once you that's a powerful force once you learn something you you tend to wanna stick with it
 	
 	
 		pardon
 		oh yeah plus everybody in your office knows it and as the new people come in they kind of help each other out
 		but you have different people with different backgrounds and they have a hard time sharing information
 	
 	
 		that's like i learned uh DFM and PFM you know Professional File Manager which is can be used as a word processor it doesn't
 		it does everything i need moves splits you know all that but uh
 		doesn't have some of the little fancy stuff like underline caps bold i mean bold and all that so
 		uh that's other than that it's you know perfectly suitable for most things i do
 	
 	
 		yeah the disadvantage disadvantage of VI editor you can't see all those fancy things  i have another thing called Q-Office from Quadratron back in California that people like to use but it's a very slow system
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i understand it's only on like we use a Gold 9050
 		and that's basically their format they use for word processing and they're trying to push people into using either WordPerfect
