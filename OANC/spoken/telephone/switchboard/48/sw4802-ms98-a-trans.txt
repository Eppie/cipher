 		uh yes i i've read uh several good books lately uh
 		lot of them uh related to um
 		business and financial matters since that's what i do for a living
 	
 	
 		oh okay um-hum
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		uh well i'm in graduate school and so i read a lot of books but i don't know if i consider very many of them good
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		i haven't read a book for enjoyment since i guess around Christmas um  i received received uh
 		uh several books for Christmas and at Christmas break i read uh Sarum by uh uh a fellow named Rutherford
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh it's the history of um well it's sort sort of the historical the historical fiction about uh the Salisbury area in in England
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and so uh i i really enjoyed that book a lot uh he's not quite as good as you know Michener or some of uh some of the other historical writers but he he did his job well so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that sounds good
 	
 	
 		uh
 		do you find it uh do do you find you have much chance to read for for just pleasure or mostly for business
 	
 	
 		no i read for pleasure some also i read a book recently called Iron John have you seen that by Bly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i don't think i have seen it
 	
 	
 		okay well it's a book about uh
 		uh Greek gods and and Greek um mythology
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as well as uh men and interacting with other men and a book about uh men and how they mature through life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and how they deal with life itself
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay i think i have heard about that
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's uh it's all revolved around uh mythology
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh as far as uh traditions from uh other cultures and our culture
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and how we uh interact with one another
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that sounds great did did it have something to mention about um sort of uh cultural rituals of of manhood
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		okay yeah i have heard of that i have uh
 		someone suggested that i read it is it Iron John
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		okay good
 	
 	
 		by Bly B L Y i believe it is
 	
 	
 		B L Y okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		great
 	
 	
 		and uh it's a very interesting book
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh what are your favorite
 		uh
 		do you have a favorite subject to read whether it be science fiction or or history or
 	
 	
 		well it depends again if we're talking about uh
 		um i read a lot of religious books
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh just because i have an interest in that area
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i read a lot of books in the area of uh um psychology and self help type uh materials
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh always trying to understand people better and understand myself in a relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because i'm in a people business
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh so that's that's that that's my work is my hobby
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's
 	
 	
 		so i i enjoy it
 	
 	
 		sounds great
 		um uh who is your uh  who is your favorite religious author
 	
 	
 		well i don't know if i have a favorite
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh religious author
 		i would have to say that uh
 		some of the ones that consistently put out good materials
 		uh
 		you know that that's difficult because
 		one person might write one book real extremely well and some other ones might not write as well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i have to stop here and think a second
 		one of the ones that i've read recently that i've read several of his books and i thought that each one of his books were good
 		he's the man out of San Antonio
 		and uh Max Lucado
 	
 	
 		Max Lucado
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Max consistently consistently writes good books
 	
 	
 		yeah uh he's a great man i've met him several times uh
 	
 	
 		yes i i know him yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but uh there's other authors also that have uh
 		uh that write good books from time to time but not consistently put out the materials all the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i'd say another which is a local writer here in Plano
 		um is
 		i'm trying to think of his name he's with the Bible church
 		and that is uh
 		i see his name but i can't i mean i see him but i can't see his name
 		
 
 		but he uh he talks about uh he talks about a lot of different topics and dimensions of the church and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
