 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know i can't give uh too good a perspective uh  how things have changed in ten twenty or thirty years
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i guess uh
 		i guess the first thing  you know comes to mind would be how they've changed to the worst
 	
 	
 		yeah  how so
 	
 	
 		in a lot of ways
 		yeah well
 		yeah
 		
 
 		i guess break down of the family unit for one thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		astounding drug use that's uh going on and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		pretty depressing if you start thinking about it i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's uh i don't know it's you know i lived in basically it's a suburb of Washington DC
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um so i you know luckily i'm  in a good area so you know i don't have to really deal with
 		a lot of the problems that DC has to deal but uh you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh kids are you know kids are bringing in guns into the grade schools and high schools and stuff
 		you know trying to kill others kids and you know it's it's it's outrageous you know
 	
 	
 		unbelievable
 	
 	
 		like like you hit the nail on the head probably that all comes from you know lack of a good family structure
 		for this people you know they just
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know which came first i don't know i think the drugs had a lot to do with it but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i don't you know
 	
 	
 		i don't know if that's a cause or an effect
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's the tricky thing trying to separate
 		figure out which is which um
 		but i don't know you know it i don't think there was much of a problem until crack started hitting the streets really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah because that's cheap and incredibly addictive and uh
 		you know that seems to be the target choice of the you know poor inter-city people
 		cocaine and marijuana i don't they really were after that i don't think they really touch that that much
 	
 	
 		however on the brighter side cars seems to be
 		performing a whole lot better
 	
 	
 		well that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh would kill for a dodge viper a the moment
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh a pretty nice car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh the uh
 		why the computers in the engines
 		you know they uh  compensate the whatever problems come along until i just
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i make six and i'm a bitch though
 	
 	
 		yeah it does i mean uh
 		but uh i do have a lot a lot help with those computers you know the curves giving a lot of information diagnostic
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but doesn't uh help the home mechanic that much unless they've got a uh you know some way to decode all that information
 	
 	
 		sounds like my wife's car i just got uh
 		Cadillac a used one eighty six and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		had a few things she had to get fixed on it and we just  so now you just pressed pressed a couple of the buttons up in the
 		uh
 		the air conditioning panel i think and uh and it reads out codes that way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and then of course have to decipher them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		with the little book i use
 	
 	
 		hum interesting
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah i don't know uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		street gangs and all that kind of stuff just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it comes back to the you know that the
 		family isn't
 		fulfilling the role it used to
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think that's probably the key thing you know the key thing so you've got
 		single mothers who are trying to raise kids and you know are off working all day and the kids are on their own
 		you know that much guidance they're going to get into trouble and
 		you know now good stable family structure uh keep them straight or you know father figure to look up to or anything
 	
 	
 		well
 		
 
 		they get so much information from the
 		TV you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		makes
 		i think part of the
 		parents
 		you know party and so forth and stands in the fact that they were
 		you know able to
 		teach them and tell them about things that and now the kids probably know more than the parents in a lot of cases
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah about somethings but i don't you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for the more important things about life i think uh a lot of kids are missing uh
 	
 	
 		right that's true
 	
 	
 		they're they're out for the the quick buck mentality
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know who they gets defined by what kind of tennis shoes they wear
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh you know they they don't have
 		really kind of deep personal values anymore you know what
