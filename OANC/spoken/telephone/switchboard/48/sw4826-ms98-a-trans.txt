 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay i'm here how do you feel about the public schools
 	
 	
 		well
 		our public schools are are really poor i feel um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation but uh we're toward the bottom
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh there's a lot of things that i see
 		that are so obviously wrong
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that you would think it'd be easy to correct but the system doesn't allow for the corrections
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah how about you
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting i have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw Georgia
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and uh she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there
 		and she complained quite a bit about this school system there
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		and Cobb County is better than the county i'm in she was in Cobb County
 	
 	
 		right
 		right i'm i can't really say much about the schools up here i really don't come from here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm only up here temporarily on an internship but um i live in Orlando Florida usually
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and the schools down there from what i know are not bad they're pretty good
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		but i know that in some i know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for example i have a brother in North Carolina and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad um just terrible
 	
 	
 		well i feel that we're way behind uh i have a son that is in the fourth grade and uh they have just now taken up division
 	
 	
 		hm
 		wow
 	
 	
 		uh yeah and and you know i  my husband and i go to the store and we buy these math books and and fractions and multiplication division things and
 	
 	
 		that is slow
 	
 	
 		i feel like uh
 		there are several areas that we're just really really slow in and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't blame the teachers as much as i blame the system it is
 	
 	
 		what do you think's wrong to cause that
 	
 	
 		well well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system and the money they do have they're not they do not use it wisely uh she my son's teacher has twenty seven students
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's certainly is a lot of students for one person
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to deal with on an every day basis
 	
 	
 		perhaps
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but more than that i don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keep the ca class in an uproar and you're not at liberty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office and it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's one thing i worry about
 	
 	
 		it you know it can you it can really be bad uh also i think
 		we have a lot of uh
 		Hispanics
 	
 	
 		there you go uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we have a lot of uh uh the county i am i'm in uh the minorities are mostly Hispanic
 	
 	
 		yeah probably quite a few black people up there and and
 	
 	
 		no  we're from a county and uh we're from the county they marched in we're in Forsyth county yes and we and there's very very few blacks uh so uh so that's um
 	
 	
 		no
 		oh is that right
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i i hate to say  it's not a problem uh because i hate to feel like they are a problem although they are
 	
 	
 		yeah but you know it it it's you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever but then again yeah there is no denying that it that
 	
 	
 		but it is a problem
 		uh especially in the inner schools inner city
 	
 	
 		sure you know teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school
 	
 	
 		well and  you can't put all the children in special education uh and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done
 	
 	
 		that's right you can't do that
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		see i grew up in Nebraska
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the school that i went to there was fantastic it i i really consider myself very very lucky
 		um we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty seven thirty kids to class to a class
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but your teacher had control
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah we zipped right along you know i i was i was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i i believe i was too
 	
 	
 		um-hum but you're right you know with all this  don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights you've also taken something away from the discipline i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school we just cannot afford it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right i was gonna ask you if there that was an option
 	
 	
 		um if
