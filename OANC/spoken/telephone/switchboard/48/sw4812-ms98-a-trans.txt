 
     		
 	
 		so how do you feel about it
 	
 	
 		uh i i i don't see any problem with with random testing for random drugs
 	
 	
 		yeah i i myself almost um am in favor of it uh
 		i work at Honeywell and i went through a a pretty i don't know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i i was brought on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think that's pretty standard at least at Honeywell it is um i think it's important to insure the quality and
 		and uh
 		i don't know almost the goodness of character you know and that kind of thing where do you work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um well i'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon and i i just came from Saint Paul uh interviewing with Three M
 	
 	
 		oh okay oh okay
 		hm
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		and uh they have a policy for uh testing if if you if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i guess the only
 		drawback i can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some uh sort of false positive result
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then there could be some sort of problem but uh it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and that that definitely happens you know i mean those the drug tests assure us they're accurate but there's always that margin of error
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's that's something to be aware of
 		another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate or they aren't that sensitive like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they gonna do about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for Honeywell and uh
 		uh you know i know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something
 		um i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um i don't know what what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon
 	
 	
 		uh electrical engineering
 	
 	
 		oh okay great um
 		yeah i'm a graduate student at UCF in Florida University of Central Florida and this is actually a  an internship up here
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um
 		they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing so
 	
 	
 		uh they they test you um before they before you start or before you even interview or
 	
 	
 		right
 		um they essentially  no i sure don't  um they essentially um
 		they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh
 		did the drug testing thing after that
 		so uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests and and then they essentially give you the offer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so uh there's some noise on this end i'm actually in a mall calling so
 	
 	
 		oh  yeah
 	
 	
 		you probably wondered huh
 		but so
 	
 	
 		what what happens if you were to fail then do they give you like one chance one more chance or two more chances
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a good question i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail i believe they give you one more chance they probably give you a chance to explain yourself
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then maybe give you another chance to go through it
 		but uh you know once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know but um what are you working right now anywhere or
 	
 	
 		uh no i'm just about to finish my masters in May and uh just interviewing with companies right now
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh okay great
 		yeah that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know was was going to Honeywell a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there and he's doing an internship with IBM
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		they basically uh did the same exact thing um we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug tresting at the same time so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process but uh
 	
 	
 		do do they test you at right now at work too
 	
 	
 		no no that's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job uh i think i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they don't do it
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know so
 		that's good i guess i don't know i mean
 		i uh
 		i have gone to a couple of parties since since that time and while i don't do any drugs myself i've seen some people who work there um
 		you know smoking a joint or whatever and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up
 		you know but
 		no they don't they don't really do that
 	
 	
 		wow is it formal policy that they said that they might test
 	
 	
 		yeah
