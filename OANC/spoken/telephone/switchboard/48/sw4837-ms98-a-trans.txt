 
     		
 	
 		so what do you think
 	
 	
 		um well i think uh there's been significant change over the last couple of decades uh
 		i guess i would say that one of the most um important changes seems to be
 		um
 		that the family the definition of family is changing a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah no doubt about it the nuclear family and just the whole downsizing approach
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know a lot of people are are are not having kids
 		are not having kids as as early or as many
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and that's yeah that goes hand in hand with some of the stuff that i had you know like maybe the whole emphasis on the environment and on social kind of a social awareness approach
 		to where people are starting to think about pollution and trash a little more and uh and the ozone layer and things like that
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		it's really putting some constraints on your whole uh the whole lifestyle which is
 	
 	
 		it seems to me it seems to me like um like everyone is lamenting you know the loss of the nuclear family and saying that it's going to be the downfall of America but to me um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know i guess that that's that's probably a pretty liberal view but i mean to me the the old um traditional nuclear family um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		seems to only work seems to work real well uh you know when uh husband is in charge of the family when he's working when mom's home taking care of the kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know as soon as mom gets equal rights and she can work too
 		then all of the sudden you know there's all these constraints on the family i mean face it it's basically
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		an old um you know religious construction so um it's it's
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah
 		see to me it
 	
 	
 		no i i actually i actually think um it's it's better the way it's working out i i think
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm
 	
 	
 		i think that when each person is is working that uh it makes for more it makes for like two dependent people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and two independent people who are sharing their lives rather than one person dependent on another person seems to me uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it could be i'm i'm kind of a conservative uh myself although
 		i don't know i've got mixed views i come from a very very conservative family where there are you know it's like you mentioned you mentioned it's like you described the first time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um where the the husband's in control the wife stays home raises the family things like that however
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't think that's a realistic approach anymore especially with the the rising cost of living and things like that there's there's almost no way you can make it with a one income family anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah it just seems that way
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know regardless of the of the social impact or the the familial impact you got to think about
 		just the pragmatic side of it in terms of how can you afford to raise however many kids one or nine
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		um with one income and it's never going to work i don't think um
 	
 	
 		see i came from um a pretty conservative family too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the uh thing is that it didn't work out and my parent's split up so maybe that's what  yeah maybe that's what um influenced my view
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah my parents yeah my parents fought like cat and dogs um they they did stay together finally and they've been married like forty years now but
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		i know i know what you mean because there's there's a lot of stress in that kind of an environment where the husband's gone all day
 		and comes home at night and like the wife is like the first thing she hits him with is all these problems
 		you know so both sides are are under a lot of stress that way
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know i was
 	
 	
 		of course of course when both um parents are working the big question is you know who how how do the kids get raised
 	
 	
 		exactly you know that's something my sister's having to face right now they've both got they've got working parents both of them and it's like they're always shuffling them off to day care
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you've got to ask yourself whose morals and whose values are being you know enforced on my kid
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know they come home and start swearing like a blue streak wait a minute i didn't teach them that stuff you know
 	
 	
 		one system that um is interesting that that we we may take in
 		that we might be good might be good for us to take into consideration is um in Israel they have this  you heard of that
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		where the kids are
 		it's kind of like of like uh a community school i guess where you know all the kids um
 		it's kind of like a boarding school i guess and they're but they're raised by adults who sort of act as
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		their parents you know because i guess in Israel
 		um you know that happens a lot too that the women are working and or in the army or something like that well um
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i don't know it seems
 	
 	
 		that's kind of interesting
 	
 	
 		seems to work really well and they somehow they um do it in such a way you know that they they pass on morals pretty well
