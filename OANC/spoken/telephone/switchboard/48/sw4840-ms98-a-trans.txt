 
     		
 	
 		okay uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well we just got our income tax return and i'm perfectly happy what about you
 	
 	
 		well let's see um i haven't gotten mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at um at home in the Bay area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i'm not sure how much i'm getting back but i'm pretty sure should get back a little bit since i'm still a student so not too much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		not too bad though
 	
 	
 		but as far as writing checks out and paying taxes i think it's pretty high but i i'm uh you know i i guess that's where we have to be where it we have to keep raising them for to keep some of the things that that we have and
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's one of  those necessities of life that we all have to you know pay taxes but uh although it is kind of a pain sometimes though
 	
 	
 		it's just scary though about you know how high are the taxes gonna be when my children are my age
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know that that's that's scary too because it's not anything like the way it was when i was young and small and a child so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know that that's a scary part too that you have to think about
 	
 	
 		yeah and and like as as time goes on you know things get more expensive and because we're  we're increasingly complex society that day by day things get more um things get more expensive as well as more complex
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know taxes are one of the ways that help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean everything from you know from Medicare to um to Social Security to um to feeding the homeless to um to you know feeding the homeless to uh maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that
 		and it's now there's more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it's it's becoming a a large responsibility but someone someone has to pay for it and that's us
 	
 	
 		yeah and then you find out about all these things about are your taxes you know the taxpayers are your money is your money going to where you want it to go and there's gonna be a special this week i i can't i can't remember if it's Twenty Twenty or one of those things where um
 		i think it's one of the local news i think they're having an a documentary something about that about they're trying to catch some people about
 		not spending your tax pay monies right and fraud and that kind of thing you know and that's kind of scary too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so that would be interesting to see i wanted to see that program
 	
 	
 		yeah and and even even today it's like you know there's still a considerable amount of taxes that you know we're paying for but you'd think that we're still in this this this uh deficit state that we're still not able to pay off things just because
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		the budget's not big enough as it is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and makes you wonder when there's  you know uh countries out there that have you know tax rates also like close to fifty percent or higher
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you can get it and that that's kind of a scary thought and i hope it doesn't come down to that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but on the other hand they also while while those countries that have high taxes also have things like um like socialized medicine and things like that too which are nice fringe benefits of it
 		so everyone has everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors that sort of thing and it's good but it's it's the price they pay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean it it can be argued one way or another whether the economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those those countries tend to be um as far as cash flow a a lot
 		um have a be tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't try and generate a larger um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a large amount of revenue because there's so little um currency flow through out the economic system
 	
 	
 		hm
 		well
 		you sure do know a lot know a lot
 	
 	
 		uh just keeping up with the times that's all
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		as it as it turns out you know it's one of those one of those interests that you know i kind of like to keep up on because well it's nice to know that when i'm actually you know i do start working that
 		i'll like to know like where my tax dollars are going too  i work hard to to get you know i like to know where it's going to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what do you think about these items that are gonna be um taxed even more like um tobacco and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		i think in a in a way it's good in a way it's not um but i think in general it's probably good i mean a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been have been in the past
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them against the taxes for them you know sponsored by alcohol and tobacco companies
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's things like tobacco are um they're they're a proven health hazard to smokers as well as nonsmokers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it's as far as a safety thing in like in San Luis Obispo for example there's an ordinance which states that um there's no smoking in any public areas
 		and so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
