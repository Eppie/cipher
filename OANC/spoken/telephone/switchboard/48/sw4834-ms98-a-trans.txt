 
     		
 	
 		i guess i guess by what you said you're you you don't feel you're uh privacy has been invaded invaded anytime recently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no not really um
 		uh the um
 		the the only thing that annoys me is when uh people call and they uh you have solicitation calls
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		probably thing that bothers me that's not really invading my privacy um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		do you feel that yours is invaded
 	
 	
 		uh nah i wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means uh you know i would there there's a lot of times though uh you get those calls and you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot and you know next thing you know
 		uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to you to tell them you know that you're not interested or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you you know and and
 		keep badgering you about it and that aggravates me but i don't know that you could call that invading of my invading my privacy because
 		you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know i want my name unlisted or i want my you know
 	
 	
 		but but that doesn't work
 	
 	
 		it doesn't
 	
 	
 		uh no because they a lot of times they dial sequentially they get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something you put your phone number on there they pass your phone number on to another company
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um or you um
 		or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or select and stuff they even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh while i was subscribing to the paper i got so upset at them that they you call me one more time i'm going to stop subscribing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and the local the local local papers will nice just you ask them to remove your uh number from their list and um
 		yeah you call up their regular during during regular hours their um they have a special department they'll take your numbers out of their list
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but the uh
 		Orlando paper um yeah they they they refused to take you off of the list and they call every month
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have
 	
 	
 		good grief
 		well let me ask you about this here's something that uh has been kind of concerning me lately my fiance received a bill from a a Lord and Taylor company uh you you know they're a they're a department store
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		she received a bill from them uh that she had visited some some store and and i think it was there in Florida maybe it was in Miami
 		uh that she had visited a store there and uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving um and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and i've i've heard recently that uh
 		uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using someone's you know they they use Joe Blow's social uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone's credit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh if you know a person's social security number and their mailing address in and their mother's maiden name  uh you can basically become that person uh person
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		um if the purchase was made made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if it was some you know coming into the store and stuff then she would of had whoever made the purchase would have had sign some kind of um you know document and uh who
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the signature um they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature uh you know they'll they have to eat the charge
 	
 	
 		yeah well you
 	
 	
 		but if the person has had their social security her social security number i'd be real concerned that they uh
 		that she's not uh blacklist on uh Telecredit what is it it's Telecreder something um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there she probably won't be able able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle
 	
 	
 		yeah well we got it cleared up eventually what happened uh
