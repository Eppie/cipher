 
     		
 	
 		
   
 	
 	
 		okay well what's happening in New York  well that's what we're doing too on our our current events and it's all over the
 	
 	
 		oh what's happening in New York we're all reading about Los Angeles i think
 	
 	
 		of course the TV and we're having a little bit of uh uh you know demonstrations here in Dallas but not anything like they're having in LA
 	
 	
 		i should hope not
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i i i was just reading this morning in the paper that it's also spreading to San Francisco as well
 	
 	
 		oh is that right well it
 	
 	
 		the rioting and all that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and last night it was going into some of the nicer areas too you know uh rather than just staying in the
 		in the uh in the sections that it started in
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh i get my current events um all three ways you know talking to people uh some TV although not much TV and uh reading the paper
 	
 	
 		do you get
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		uh i'm big on the morning radio i guess i woken get woken up by the alarm and catch the day's news real quickly
 	
 	
 		well that's something i used to do when i had a long drive to work or a or a maybe a thirty or forty minute drive to work i would turn the the news on and listen to that all the way
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i don't do that anymore it's just that i guess a habit i've gotten out out of and that's uh that's a real good way to get everything recapped
 	
 	
 		you know i was just doing some thinking recently on we only hear
 		we hear the news in a slanted fashion by how it's reported to us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i was looking at this morning's paper and you see uh you know the cover photo is
 		a truck and and in the background everything's in flames
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think they kind of uh set you up in a way
 	
 	
 		well i know they do
 		i was uh i worked in public relations for um a a Safeway Stores which was a is a big grocery chain in used to be in this area it's not here any longer and it used to be in New York i don't know there
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard of it
 	
 	
 		and uh i was their uh press person uh public relations person for about five years and handled all of the press
 		and i would tell them one thing on the phone very carefully
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and they would report it
 		not so carefully and in different context you had to be so careful uh whenever there was an interview on television uh they would tape a interview ask you lots of questions and then they would just take excerpts out that
 		uh you know  standing alone would didn't mean the same thing
 		and so but we just really you really had a we had a tough time uh
 		relating to what you actually what was actually going on as to what was being reported
 	
 	
 		um i i think uh the news is starting to think of itself as theater
 	
 	
 		well i think you're you may be right there too uh and i can see where
 		did you happen to hear the uh interview of the uh juror
 	
 	
 		no no no
 	
 	
 		uh last night on TV
 		she said that the public saw only a small portion of that tape
 		now i you know on this Rodney King
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now i can't side with her
 		you know
 		because they they you know you can see see what was happening and that's totally wrong
 		but you know we were shown just a portion of something we weren't shown a whole picture
 	
 	
 		well well something i read in the paper was you know if you just hear the headlines you don't know that there were three other people in the car that was stopped who got out put their hands up and said okay we give up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's exactly right
 	
 	
 		you know and they don't tell you that that makes you so angry to think that oh they beat on this poor man
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		this one person
 	
 	
 		but he he had a choice to you know this all could have been you know avoided if he had behaved himself i i i believe they overreacted horribly
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		right
 	
 	
 		but you know if you think of the cop's point of view he has a wife and two kids and he wants to get home tonight and he doesn't know how crazy this guy is
 	
 	
 		exactly and he's resisting
 	
 	
 		so everybody's fighting for their life and you can see how this can get out of hand
 	
 	
 		um-hum exactly
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but like you said we were not shown that we were not uh unless we you know read in-depth you you get that you don't get that impression and so that makes everybody up in arms
 	
 	
 		i've been very annoyed lately by the sensationalism that's going on
 		i was uh visiting some friends over the Easter vacation in California in uh California near San Francisco
 		and the big thing out there was they were finally after twenty five years going to execute someone
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh whereas they've always had a death pentalty penalty they always put it off
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she had the TV on and they go to say they go on to say well the cyanide came into the room and after about a minute his head slumped and they went into gross gross detail
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean why is this on TV is this news do we want to know it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it was disgusting and this whole thing with Willie Kennedy Smith you know did he rape this girl did he not why is that headline news
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well it wouldn't be if it was anyone else
 	
 	
 		yeah but i mean i think the newspapers are irresponsible
 	
 	
 		it wouldn't have been if it
