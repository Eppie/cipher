 
     		
 	
 		what do you think about capital punishment
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes
 	
 	
 		yeah which crimes do you feel that
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think first degree murder um
 		probably warrants it
 	
 	
 		yeah because most so many times that's so brutal and just recurrent
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		felons i think should also
 	
 	
 		exactly recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i come from a state that has well i originally come from a state that has uh
 		the death penalty i come from Florida and uh they're pretty liberal on it they tend to like fry people left and right which go ahead
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's a
 		go ahead Texas is too Texas i saw on TV the other night is the has had forty six in like the past several years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so they're pretty
 		hip on it too i guess they do it by lethal injection at Huntsville
 	
 	
 		yeah okay i think Florida still uses electric chair
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i don't i don't know in some ways i don't like it because it's like you're playing God
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's not you know i don't think that's right but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year they
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what's happening here there is like um that's in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the the turn over rates of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um repeat uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again
 	
 	
 		sure and it's like you know that's a big problem but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's really you know it's it gets to be a a really a big problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um go ahead
 	
 	
 		i wish if they if they were gonna do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't be a little more you know not being able to put it off for fifteen years
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum yeah because a lot of these guys you know they get in and they they get off for good behavior
 		and i don't know i mean up in Minnesota where i am now they don't have the death penalty and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system
 		you know because they figure well you know sure i i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something um
 		but then for if i if i elicit good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		oh sure you know i mean just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails um you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early
 	
 	
 		goodness
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head um
 		i don't know i think that may solve a lot of that maybe not solve it but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know maybe even help a little bit
 	
 	
 		i yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient um kind of takes away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		from the significance of the death penalty
 	
 	
 		um-hum what do you do Georgeanne
 	
 	
 		i'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh okay great what program you in
 	
 	
 		um Audiology
 	
 	
 		okay fantastic uh i'm a doctoral student at University of Central Florida
 	
 	
 		yeah what do you do
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm doing an internship up at Honeywell
 	
 	
 		oh really neat
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		but um
 		i don't know it's it's an interesting issue there's like you say in Texas there's been quite a few and and in Florida in the last few years
 		i think there's been a lot i can't i  i mean i can't give you figures but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i just and this was in conjunction with a guy that was put in the gas chamber
 		in California so i i think it the forty sixth in last twenty five years i think it's what they gave a run down that Texas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh is that right
 		okay
 	
 	
 		Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then
 	
 	
 		yeah i i kind of yeah i've heard things about that i've heard that they don't mess around very much yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah um they they don't get repealed as easily as they do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		like in the guy in California got third you know twice before he went to the gas chamber and then they said okay no you don't have to go and then they took him back i mean it just seems
 	
 	
 		jeez that's a lot of repeals
 	
 	
 		yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent and then you had like who you have
 		these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back whenever you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i don't know i i'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it uh i guess what is it what's the policy now with treason do they uh do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence i
 	
 	
 		no i don't i don't think um the military doesn't execute anymore so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or death before the firing squad or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i think about the only one is um
 		rape
