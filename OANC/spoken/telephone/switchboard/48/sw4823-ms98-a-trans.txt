 
     		
 	
 		i think that the middle east is of all the uh regions of the world the most volatile that we seem to be getting ourselves involved in
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i'm not sure we're doing so with
 		sufficient knowledge about the history of the area and um with what uh the people there expect i think we're just getting ourselves into a barrel of trouble
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think we may have the knowledge knowledge of the history but certainly not any understanding of the history
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we seem to be you know doing the same we've done in many other cases which is sticking our noses in where it doesn't belong
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i think it's you know motivated
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know clearly by the fact of the resources that are controlled by the region which is
 	
 	
 		oh clearly yes and um
 	
 	
 		of the you know used up in the next twenty to fifty years there won't any oil any oil left i'm sure
 	
 	
 		hum
 		
 
 		well i feel that as far as US policy's been concerned while i understand um a position in allied um friendship with Israel
 		i think that we've applied a lot of double standards in the legion uh in the past as far as dealing with the Arabs versus dealing with the Israelis and the expectations that we put on the
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh Arab nations uh while basically succumbing to a very powerful Israeli lobby in this country
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i i think that the Palestinian question is a key to a lot of problems in the region
 		and i don't think that this country's handled that well at all
 	
 	
 		yeah well  probably from there is that the
 		same problem as anywhere else anytime you take something away from somebody and give it to somebody else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that you  didn't own in the first place there's you know going to be problems i mean that's basically what's happened i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		basically a handful of nations took away from Palestinians what was their homeland and gave it to the Israelis you know to the Israelis
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you know it's not the way to go about any kind of uh
 		solution that's ever going to be workable you know i mean you neither party was consulted up front
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah i kind of anticipate that because you know we set the stage and how we've dealt with that issue in such a poor manner by basically you know
 		paying lip service to the Palestinians in the past
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh i think that's up the stage for the end effect to for this uh uh revolution of Islamic fundamentalism what seems to be sweeping
 		definitely through North Africa and uh within parts of the Middle East as well something which terrifies the moderate Arab states
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well it's pretty scary anybody if you think about i mean any any time you get fundamentalists you know whatever nature
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and in power anywhere i mean they're they're pure fanatics and there's that you know fundamentally no way to deal with a fanatic
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you can't argue with them on any sort of logical or emotional basis
 		a fanatic will believe in X Y Z and you're never going to change that
 	
 	
 		yeah i i suspect
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so you might as well not even try
 	
 	
 		i suspect that we'll probably in uh with the demise of the Soviet Union formation of Russia whatever ends up coming out of that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that probably the biggest problems we're going to have in foreign policy are going to have Middle East in the future
 		i think that we're going to continue to see a lot more fundamentalist influence in the area it's been spawning for a long time
 		the more moderate states uh even including Saudi Arabia which is a very religious country Islamic wise it's not allowed the fundamentalist to gain control
 		but uh i you know Tunisia and uh now we have problems with Sudan
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh these places i think that you know we're just in the beginning here of uh what will probably sweep through i mean Egypt's suffering the same kinds of problems with fundamentalism right now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the more nations that join with this kind of uh thinking in government the more stronger uh difficulty we're going to have
 		as a nation in dealing with the region because of our past experiences with the Palestinians
 	
 	
 		yeah i think a lot of it is is just rejection of the current
 		you know power structure and that power structure happens to be religiously aligned and aligned with uh you know a religious based monarchy in a lot of those countries
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that they're basically rejecting that power structure in favor of another which is you know return to a fundamentalist thing i mean it's not to unlike what happened in the United States
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		over the last ten years i mean basically people rejected you know there's  fundamentalist you know movement
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wasn't quite as severe or as you know fanatically radical i mean because the
 		uh
 		the class structure is is you know less
 		prolific here or less you know regionally defined here and uh
 		the uh the differences aren't so so strong as in say talking about like Saudi we're you've got you know uh basically a ruling
