 
     		
 	
 		the biggest social change that i've seen in the last ten years
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is that i you know i'm only twenty four twenty five right just turned twenty five and ten years ago i can remember when it was not common to see two people in a family or household working
 		and getting behind and uh running into economic problems the way things are today um
 		you know today just to get by in many cases you have to have two people working in the middle income house just to stay with where they were in the seventies
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum i agree with that
 	
 	
 		and and it's it's really rough that's probably the biggest thing i've noticed
 	
 	
 		well i'd have to take a slightly different thing uh viewpoint uh i'm uh thirty five uh and um
 		uh to me it's something a little more subtle it it's just a prevalence of computer technology and uh everyday life i mean
 		i can remember when everything was still done by by hand by paper by hand  as opposed to computer generated paper now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um you know uh before uh you know when uh clerks in grocery stores uh actually had to be able to add things up and in their head and check it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is  plusses and minuses there i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i remember when we were going to the grocery store when i was younger those big monstrosity cash register
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		with the greens buttons the rows and rows
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		and it was actually quite and art form to see some of the you know older or or more experienced cashiers go you know fly through that is like those Japanese hippies see what the abacus is still
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh so uh maybe that's just a different viewpoint uh but uh i just
 		remember everything well just writing a letter for for work you know i mean in word processor you know we can
 		to me i can't even image now how they even produced books or letters before word processors you know then we'd have to through fifty iterations at least the way i write letters and things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah i i found all through school you know you write your hand to death you go through pens and uh i'm actually because i have two computers here
 		i'm actually loosing the ability to write by hand and feel comfortable doing it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's too slow i think the speed of the computer i think much faster because i can type much faster than i can actually write now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i what happens is words will drop out of writing and i'll go back because i'm thinking so i'm thinking at the speed that i type on the computer
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and you know we didn't have that problem ten years ago and then we didn't have fax machines and we didn't have to you know press one if you want to be directed to the service department press two
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i you know i i i don't even write any more mainly because uh well i can type faster like you can and also my handwriting is  legible i can't i can't blame it on that printer most of the time so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		it's it's incredible you know i remember i started on a Commodore sixty four in ninety eighty six that was my first computer
 		and today i'm on a three eight six thirty three and it's too slow you know i can't wait
 	
 	
 		yeah hey same here same here yeah we
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's got to go faster you know
 	
 	
 		well we're getting greedy i guess but uh well with regarding to your comment i i have to agree with that too there's a prevalence of uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		of uh two income households that uh you never really saw before although i probably on the exception of that my both my parents did work but most of my friends parents when i was growing up
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		the mother did not and uh it's simply not the case and uh
 		to to keep the uh bank that owns your house happy the bank that owns both your cars happy and the bank that owns your credit card happy  you do have to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think my wife in fact uh started to work part-time now because we'd started out we got married she had not uh uh wanted to work uh after we had our first kid and i said fine but now
 		paying for these kids  she's she's had to back to work part-time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah up here
 		up here in Rochester almost everybody works for Kodak or Xerox and ten ten years ago you were always assured of having a job
 	
 	
 		um yeah i remember that
 	
 	
 		and now you you know i my grandfather worked for his entire life for Kodak my father the same thing but now everyone's worried and
 		and uh you can't rely on that kind of thing anymore everything sped up so fast and there's no more old-fashioned reliability in things anymore the way pace the pace has changed
 	
 	
 		i remember when i got out of college which was seventy eight people said now if you get a job with General Motors or AT&T or IBM
 		you're set for life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		not after AT&T's going to let go fifty thousand people i i'm uh constantly putting stuff up in  telecom
 		from the CWA the union there and they're letting people go like crazy it's just it they're replacing them with computers
 	
 	
 		well you plus you know you know after the uh divestiture or well break up
