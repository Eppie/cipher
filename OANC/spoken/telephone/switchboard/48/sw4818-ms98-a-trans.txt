 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um well i'm just really excited about it because i'm graduating from college next month and i hope to be buying a car sometime  in the future
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so so hopefully uh maybe do you have any good advice do you have a car or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh yeah i do have a car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh right now i have sort of a sporty car it's a Subaru that is it's called an XT6 i don't think they make them anymore i think i have the last year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's one of these Japanese cars that run without needing many repairs um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my advice about cars is uh get a good engine get something that goes not because i'm a speed freak uh something because if you want to get on a highway you don't want to step on the gas and and say come on come on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		i do you know  they make jokes about women picking out the color but i really do like to have a decent sized engine in my car
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i have a six cylinder and it does go when i tell it to and and i just like the looks of a kind of sporty car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i think my car needs are going to change i had very small children and i was saddled with a station wagon that i never wanted
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um i was told that you know it'll hold groceries and all this stuff well the grocery bags fell over in a station wagon
 	
 	
 		that's true they do my mom has one
 	
 	
 		you know and and you know and i wasn't that thrilled to put a bike in it or a dog in it and i didn't so when i got a new car i got a sporty little car and my kids were still small enough but they weren't in baby seats anymore and they sat in the back
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and now my son is fourteen and a half and he's taller than i am and every time i go over a bump he crashes his head because
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		you know these cars have they're backseats but they're kind of toy backseats
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so i think should i get another car uh much to my chagrin it'll have to be something more boxy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know practical again so this i guess i guess this is my reprieve and i guess my suggestion to you is to get something you really enjoy because at some later date you'll have to get something more practical
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's great advice i'm so glad i got to talk to you that's good that's what i needed to hear  yeah i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm looking for uh something kind of small because it's only me and i'm a small person i'm only about five one  so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and i'd like to get something made in the United States so i would look for that first but
 		if it turns out that a better price is from say Japan like the Subarus then i i would go for that because the most important thing is price i mean because
 	
 	
 		well you know the more i think of it  you know with what's going on in the world nowadays i think the next car i would try to buy an American one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		would you really
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so it's you know Toyotas and all those they're they're nice cars but you know surely there's an American car i i'd love to check out the Saturn which is supposed to be a new newly made American car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you would think so
 		um-hum actually i heard really good things about them and uh it's funny because i just spent last weekend i was down in Washington DC visiting my sister and they are everywhere down there it's amazing because you hardly see any of them on the road here in Philadelphia but i saw about ten in one weekend
 		and uh my sister had gone to the dealership and she was really impressed she uh the one thing that really impressed her which sounds kind of weird but they actually have women salesmen
 		it's weird because i mean have you ever seen a woman car salesman
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i have
 	
 	
 		really because i was surprised but and she said they were really nice and
 		one good thing about the car is it's really hard to dent you know when you're driving a car and you you go in a parking yeah you know most cars in a parking lot like a cart shopping cart hits it or a car door hits it and you have like these dents well the lady took a hammer to this car and it didn't dent
 	
 	
 		is it really
 		huh
 	
 	
 		she was like smashing it and it didn't  it's it's made of something i don't what it is but
 	
 	
 		really how was the pricing
 	
 	
 		it's actually supposed to be really good the smaller ones i think around are eight thousand and then it gets up to maybe twelve thousand
 	
 	
 		oh that's that's not horrible at all that's quite good nowadays
 	
 	
 		so they they look really nice
 		yeah yeah so i don't know maybe that's something to think about because they're supposed to be completely made in the United States not one of these deals where
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it says it's made in the United States but the engine is really made in Japan and all the parts are made in Japan right
 	
 	
 		parts are made in different places right i wonder who makes the the Geos because
 	
 	
 		i think that's Chevrolet
 	
 	
 		is it because they're so cute The Geo Storm is adorable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that is really nice that's true i don't know anything about them at all do you know anyone who has one
 	
 	
 		no no i don't in fact i i sat in one a long time ago and slammed the car door and it felt a little tinny you know it was it's a smaller lighter car
 	
 	
 		i know
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you know that was years ago that was about four years ago when i bought mine so it may have changed i know on looks i think the Storm is just adorable little car for a single person
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah that is really cute that's true
 	
 	
 		hm are are you working yet
 	
 	
 		so
 		um well i'm in ROTC so i'll be in the Army so on active duty so yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah because i was wondering if you're are you going to finance it
 	
 	
 		probably yeah is that a good way to go i guess i don't know which one
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh well i have been fortunate enough to be able to just pay for it and i i like to do that but there are people who can pay for it who prefer to finance it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah it it seems to me as you're paying interest you're bound to be end up paying more i guess now you have to think about uh if the money in the bank will get more interest
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh then then you'll want to finance it but if now the banks are giving so little interest i imagine you might as well just pay for it if you could
 	
 	
 		oh i see
