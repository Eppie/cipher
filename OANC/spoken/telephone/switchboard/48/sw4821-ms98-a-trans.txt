 
     		
 	
 		okay um let me see  i've been sitting here awhile i almost forgot the topic but uh it seems like i get most of my news from television
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm we only get the paper on the weekends and so i'm not much of a
 		of a paper reader or
 		but i i and i'm don't rarely listen to the um radio so it i get most of my news like from documentaries like Forty Eight Hours Twenty Twenty you know it the news at night
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		news news in the afternoon and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i i get a weekend paper as well and uh in addition to that i get a local weekly i i live in suburb of Milwaukee and they get they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		have community newspapers around here so the local their extremely local  stuff uh is in the local paper that comes out once a week and then i get the Sunday
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh Milwaukee Journal because i don't have time to read a paper uh mostly that's my difficulty i uh i get my news pretty much from the same source as you do although i do listen to NPR
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		which has very good and that's National Public Radio which has very good uh coverage of the national and international news i feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well usually
 	
 	
 		huh
 		um
 		are you in the car quite a bit or
 	
 	
 		no i'm not actually uh but i can run my radio in my office i i i teach at the university and when i'm not
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		teaching if i choose to have the radio on i can listen to that station so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh i see um
 	
 	
 		how how are you are you satisfied with the Twenty Twenty and Forty Eight Hours and the things that you do watch
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i pretty much am and i watch the news at least twice a day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh if i've missed something and and and i've just recently decided to home with my children and so it seems as if i catch the news rise right as it happens happens you know there was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the explosions and that kind of thing my husband will say how'd you know about that and i said yes it happened at such and such time and that's so that that's different for me so i usually find out when exactly when it happens and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is is the timely you noting noting of the events as they happen is that what you feel good about in the news coverage
 	
 	
 		uh no it just seems like since i've recently stayed home
 		that that is what's happened you know it's just that uh
 		i now that i've stayed home i'm i'm usually aware of when when these things have occurred and it happened and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i i myself uh the the reason why i listen to NPR and the reason why i watch MacNeil Lehrer rather than the
 		than the network shows news shows at night although i do often watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which shows shows you know carries over a lot of the national news stories uh is that
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		quite often it seems to me that  the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis
 		the local doesn't either but i feel that MacNeil Lehrer get a little more deeply into some some of the issues that are really current
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and perhaps newspapers do that but as i said i don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper and frankly when i have read a newspaper i haven't noticed that kind of analysis either
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so um
 		there's there is some danger to that of course too because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then
 		you know how good is it but
 		uh i like a little more indepth coverage and i think that's what you're maybe appealing to you too on something like Twenty Twenty or Forty Eight Hours
 	
 	
 		right right it kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		um
 	
 	
 		i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know there that an event has occurred
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture maybe because i'm easily confused by detail i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i know what you're saying
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah but i try and catch most of those programs  on Wednesdays and Fridays and if i miss them i try and
 		you know i try and and uh tape them if i'm out or that kind of thing i try and tape them and
 		so i can sit back and watch it and it's pretty interesting um
 	
 	
 		when you have young children right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the TV set for awhile without interruption
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah plus i find i have to video tape quite a bit of things if i don't want any interruptions yeah that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		oh you do uh-huh
 		uh-huh when is your good watching time
 	
 	
 		um it seems like ten o'clock at night
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes
 		yeah that's what what
 	
 	
 		unfortunately but that's that's what it seems like ten o'clock at night
 	
 	
 		i have older children and getting dinner on the table i come from the east coast and i was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it amazed me when i got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time they still watch the news when New York
