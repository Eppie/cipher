 
     		
 	
 		he uh well do you use a budget
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i do at times off and on right now i'm probably in one of the more the more off times
 	
 	
 		any particular reason uh that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you
 	
 	
 		oh it works fine it's just i i think sometimes i you know you get busy you slack off a little bit and then
 		you know there's no more uh i mean you know then it's work to catch up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you know then the two or three times where i've got to the point i really needed one i created one and stuck by it
 	
 	
 		and you do stick by it when you do it huh
 	
 	
 		yes how about you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is i list all my income coming in and the expenses and whatever's left over i spend
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know i just
 		that just kind of seems to be the way it works
 	
 	
 		the budget i stuck on the most
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		was the the budget i was on the most was what was called the ten twenty seventy budget
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		and basically ten percent of your income goes to uh
 		uh long-term savings
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		twenty percent goes toward
 		uh basically short-term you know doing going out to dinner
 		like going to the movies uh maybe you know saving that part up toward like going on you know something something a little little more short-term than like the long-term budget
 		and then the other and then seventy percent goes toward uh uh you know paying debts and and and that kind of stuff with the whole idea being that you pay yourself first you're more likely to stick with it
 	
 	
 		yes and i know that that theory unfortunately neither i'm married married and neither my husband or myself have the greatest amount of self-control in the world
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh so that makes it pretty easy not to stick with the budget at times you know instead of thinking oh we'll save it this month we'll think well oh gee we'll buy this lamp or this whatever you know
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so uh our savings our savings plan sometimes goes down the drain
 		but are you married
 	
 	
 		uh i will be a week from next Monday
 	
 	
 		oh do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in any way
 	
 	
 		no not really
 	
 	
 		have you kind of discussed this already with your fiancee
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so far for now i think uh i mean for now we've still got our own money really
 		uh
 		and that'll probably it'll probably be that way till uh you know we like buy our own house together or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in which case you know it's very convenient to once again throw everything together
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well i agree it's uh
 		maybe for us anyway it's easier just to to put it all in one big pot and not worry about who makes what or who you know who donates what to it
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but uh but we just kind of started out that way and
 	
 	
 		yeah and and right now in my case it's more situation that uh that she uh
 		uh has still got a lot of debt
 		and it's easier for me to kind of like just shoulder
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		the normal stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and let her concentrate on getting herself out of debt
 	
 	
 		well that's a good idea do you think this is true of all women i seem to have been in debt when my husband and i got married too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i was the year before and that was the last time i really got on a budget was to really fight being in debt because i didn't like it
 	
 	
 		uh no it's not a whole lot of fun
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 		i think it's people in general
 		yeah you have a tendency that's a tendency to do it when you can
 		uh
 		one of the ways i insure my long-term savings is the fact that you know i've got a 401K plan so i've got
 		uh five percent of my income going into that uh that's actually five percent before taxes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh that could you know so that's even more and then i've also uh
 		uh you know got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions
 	
 	
 		which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check you'll think oh well i just won't put anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		or you know even if it's of course most of us are direct deposit anymore anyway i'm sure but once it goes into the checking account it's awfully hard to transfer it over
 	
 	
 		right well i've i've even got a uh fifty dollar a month uh uh mutual fund automatic transfer on the twentieth of every month
 	
 	
 		that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		you know once again you know you know it's there you know it's going to happen
 		it's a uh
 		an easier way to uh
 		to save
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and uh your fiancee is she'll she goes along with the savings part too even though uh she's managed to get herself into debt
 	
 	
 		no she has no saying
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but you're going to manage to make her stick to your plan right
 	
 	
 		well sure you know you know like you said for right now we really kind of each have our own money which is maybe a weird way to do your budgeting but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i think until you know we're we're both growing  because you know of that i think it'll probably stay away for awhile
 	
 	
 		well actually i know some people a a girlfriend of mine who was married probably about three three or four years ago and they still have separate checking accounts that's the way they prefer it uh
 		you know uh she doesn't go into detail as to why they prefer it that way or anything but it's everybody as long as i think uh your
 	
 	
 		right
