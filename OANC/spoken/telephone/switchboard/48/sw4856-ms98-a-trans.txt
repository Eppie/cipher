 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		in Texas they do have the um capital punishment and um
 		i i just i i'm probably one that has to agree with it too um
 		there're
 		are some things that go on that i just feel that
 		i i just feel that that that that is a need i don't i don't know a lot of people don't feel that way either but i just feel that that
 	
 	
 		well i don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state but California we just put somebody to death
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um for i think it was a double murder uh to be honest i didn't pay that much attention uh to the details of it um
 		
 
 		but it had a lot of controversy out here uh basically because in California people like to protest about everything um
 		but i agree i believe that that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the big disagreement i have is that
 		in California the appeals process uh is so extensive and takes so long
 		that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually you know put somebody to death for for a crime
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that is a consequence yeah
 	
 	
 		and i mean that's that's ridiculous i mean if you can you know you you the trial is supposed to prove you know within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty
 		and then they have appeals well that's fine but it shouldn't take more than a few years i mean i should think two or three years maximum you should be able to know and you should be able to either put the guy to death
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		or he's innocent i mean it's if he's guilty for for you know multiple murders or whatever the case may be you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 		well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on but i i just feel that that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		capital punishment needs to stay within the system not all states have them but i
 		you know was that was that the i'm not sure if that was in was that the man that that claimed he was abused or
 	
 	
 		yeah he was like um the the the defense the defense they're were giving given was that uh like his mother had had been an alcoholic when when she was pregnant with him and so he he wasn't you know mentally competent or anything else
 	
 	
 		and that he had some he
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which is ridiculous and and the court found him competent um and he knew what he was doing and everything else i mean you know it was it was the best defense they could come up with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and how long had he been appealing appealing how long was that
 	
 	
 		i forget i think it was something like twelve years or something
 	
 	
 		gosh boy
 	
 	
 		it was it was something really outrageous
 	
 	
 		yeah boy
 		well i mean and it seems like it it rarely does happen you know it's not it's not used that often you know at least here in Texas but i think it's something that needs to stay i really do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think in general uh
 		punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be i mean it needs to be you know it's kind of like
 		the the the justice system in the United States is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet and you wait three months and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i mean there's there's no connection between the two
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean you take these you know most of the people who are committing violent crimes most of them not all by any means but you know a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um they don't really see past next week much less next year and to say you know well if i kill somebody then a decade from now i might face the punishment
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's not real it doesn't have any real impact on them
 	
 	
 		my sister and i were wondering about this recently because a an old friend of ours in California this just happened about a week ago um her husband just killed her and we're wondering if that has an effect
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if that if something does capital punishment
 		you know does it happen with that within that uh
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		um you you mean would he be put to death for that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um largely depends on the circumstances and generally
 		you know from what i understand it's it's only the most brutal types of things usually where it's multiple you know
 	
 	
 		i think you're right
 	
 	
 		if if they can say things like you know well he was just you know temporarily insane because of some domestic squabble then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know they'll they'll give him you know twenty years with with parole in in twelve or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and uh i have an uncle that is an attorney that defends uh people on
