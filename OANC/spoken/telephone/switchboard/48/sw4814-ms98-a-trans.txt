 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so interesting political trends or events huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i guess the uh most interesting one that's uh going on right now from my perspective is this uh phenomena of um  uh Ross Perot
 		uh caught his interview last night with David Frost and it was the the first time i had you know heard um you know his views expressed by himself i had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the whole phenomena of him coming out of uh literally no where no party um at least no apparent party support on either side
 		is pretty interesting
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah i have not even heard believe it or not of that person i'm  not kidding when you when you said it it was kind of like a surprise
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		like out of nowhere yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i think mainly because i haven't been watching what's politically going on um in that at you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in that aspect uh as far as like now the new health bill that went through Minnesota uh being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in Minnesota and more familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um as far as politics in the grander uh
 		part of it as if you want to look at uh election type things i'm not quite sure even if i'm going to vote uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		it it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well it seems that the decisions so far has been filtered by uh you know party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		the the candidates are already beyond what uh most public uh feels is acceptable behavior
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know the one of the common criticisms of Clinton is uh gee he'll say or do anything in order to get to the White House and and up unto the point of uh Perot being a serious candidate it seems like that
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		that was a requirement of being a a contender within the party is is to have done all those things
 	
 	
 		um-hum sure
 	
 	
 		i mean here's a here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward you know getting the party nomination and and preparing himself for the presidency
 		and now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of
 		a whole nonpolitical arena
 	
 	
 		he might be a a one of those sure uh it it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer
 		uh when you think of some of the best presidents we've had in the past have been people that have struggled to get to the top i mean they were not rich in in any means
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it has been kind of in the past uh i don't know maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved involved with politics they've had to have money
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it makes the common person uh not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent and
 		i don't know if we'll ever see that you know where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and uh has
 		um you know you think of Abraham linking Lincoln and you know just the the background of Abraham Lincoln you know teaching himself to read he didn't go to college he didn't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know do all the other things that um you know you would think that was real popular to do and to get politically politically involved and and have money he didn't come from money um
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		and and yet even he was a a consummate politician in the sense that uh not only did he fail uh fail in business twice with bankruptcy and and failure but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one
 	
 	
 		and now it it
 		um-hum sure
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the first election first and only election he won was um the presidency
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he he had lost every other office that he had you know he was appointed a couple of times to like uh  uh state legislator
 	
 	
 		so you really know a lot of his background
 	
 	
 		yeah then when then when he finally did when an election uh it was the presidency yeah
 	
 	
 		it was the big one it's the one that everybody wants yeah whether or not uh you know you look at all these candidates that want to become President i really have to ask them why you know um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's the toughest job in the world to do and not only that you don't have that much freedom to make choices i mean you have to go through so many different you got to go through the House the Congress and all of the a other things to get a bill passed
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and sure you can veto veto it at the last minute but then it's not like you have all that power and i think along time ago Presidents did have a lot of power and i think we're
 	
 	
 		um-hum
