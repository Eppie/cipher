 
     		
 	
 		opinion on uh domestic or our policy towards uh Latin America is that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		especially during the Reagan now Bush administrations
 		we seem to have a double standard in place over um how we treat them countries down there for example
 		a left wing regime or communist regime is God awful and uh basically uh you know Satan incarnate
 		while nations like for a long time uh El Salvador and uh uh Guatemala
 		with with right wing regimes we kind of just winked at things like death squads and alike yeah we found Nicaragua to be the most horrible thing in the earth
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i just felt and it's the same thing with Cuba that we we really seem to have this kind of double standard down there
 		whereas if your regime doesn't want to bother us a reason of threat to us we'll kind of ignore you
 		you can do whatever you want but if you invite the commies in you know look out
 	
 	
 		or if it it doesn't even have to be commies if it's just a little left of uh of uh what the prevailing attitude is in the United States it was bad somehow and
 		um certainly the right wing death squads were just as uh
 		
 
 		deadly if not more so than anything set up by any of the left wing governments
 		uh and and that uh showed in the uh  who allowed to  to come into this country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		if people are coming from left wing countries uh it was viewed that they were
 		uh only seeking uh economic uh benefits and not actually escaping uh death threats
 		whereas if uh they were coming from right uh am i saying this correctly or if
 		if if they were coming from um right wing regimes um
 	
 	
 		you wouldn't want them in
 	
 	
 		we wouldn't let them in yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's like Guatemala how many Guatemalan and El Salvador refugees have we seen and heard about in the last ten years
 		yet Nicaraguan refugees for the longest time were welcome with open arms as escapees and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and any communist type of regime down there i mean the whole the whole farce in Granada
 	
 	
 		oh gosh what an embarrassment
 	
 	
 		right was it just
 		i mean it was the most ridiculous thing and this is the kind of policy that we have down there i mean then we have this fake drug war
 	
 	
 		no with uh
 	
 	
 		down there and that seems to be well we'll give you aid but oh no not to feed your people no we want you to clean up
 		uh our drug problem for us here's some money go shoot people with it you know
 	
 	
 		right what was the whole thing with Panama i mean here we were paying uh Noriega for years
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and then suddenly
 		we go in and bomb his country and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in Panama and and and try and indite him i i don't understand what that was all about
 	
 	
 		well it's the same thing that happened with Iraq for years and years
 		here we are sending money over here playing these people off of each other it's was same thing in Iraq playing Saddam Hussein off off you know off of Iran
 		in this case Panama off of Nicaragua and uh Cuba and any of the other left wing regimes down there
 		here we are giving them all this money and they're crooks and then when they don't do something that's suitable to our particular policy we have to go and invade them
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		and for what what does it leave us with absolutely nothing
 		i mean it wouldn't surprise me
 		it wouldn't have surprised me if uh Noriega got off on all of the charges that you know instead of being found guilty and then let him go just isn't we're an embarrassment you know
 	
 	
 		truly truly
 	
 	
 		and and i just think you know we have this kind of short term we are not interested in developing the region unless there's big business involved and wants to get involved down there
 		we we tend to treat them as sort of like a backyard and you know i'm just  just like Mexico
 	
 	
 		right it's sort of it's our our little colony is that they do just if they provide the labor and the debiting of uh
 		of Ford or uh uh
 		the
 		united fruit then that's fine
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		but uh if they're actually trying to educate
