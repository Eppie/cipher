 
     		
 	
 		opinion on whether we need to change to the metric system is that i don't think that i have an opinion one way or the other
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i kind of feel that there are more important issues to be dealt with than worrying about the metric system and i think the reason it failed last time is that most people really just didn't see any real benefit in changing
 		so i guess if we were to go about making the change
 		you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise we're never going to really see any change
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		i oh i'll say this first i'm certainly for conversion to the metric system unfortunately i'm not sure how well grounded my uh feelings for that are maybe it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just because it's a highly regular system and you don't have to worry about whether something is five thousand two hundred and eighty units or or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm just going to walk over here and stop my cats from doing what they're doing um and the metric system is you know
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you it has so many different prefixes like autometer and femtometer and stuff like that you don't need them just use the you know the meter the kilometer you know whatever it's i don't know that that's i think that's its primary uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		primary uh use is that
 		and of course in scientific uses uh things like the like a mile uh or i'm not sure a pound uh have have some use whenever you try to uh combine them into formula then you have to
 		uh have conversion constants and things like that so most most of the formulas although they are are some that uh don't obey this rule
 		most scientific formulas can be adapted with the metric system because of the way things are interrelated that you'll need those extra conversion constants
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like a cubic let's see what is it a cubic centimeter of water is also a gram of water at standard temperature and pressure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well whenever the Canadians changed we're since we're very close to the Canadian border here we kind of observed things when they made their change
 		and they were able to convert a little more readily although most people up there still would talk in terms of fahrenheit instead of Celsius
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh even though they try to get you to use the Celsius system it it went a little easier because Canada is so influenced by Britain
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and a lot of the products and services that they were either dealing with or receiving on their end were really equipped for the metric system
 		and uh it was a easier change and they saw some direct benefit because they didn't have to pour the extra income in to making special products just for the  older system
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um you know in in this country you have really stubborn people
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		who i don't think are going to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round uh manufacturing industries
 		but the average person in Raleigh Missouri i don't think is going to what was this celsius stuff you know i don't
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it it happens first well it i guess it happens first in either of the two places i guess either in the school or just products
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh one thing about uh a lot of US products i'm just looking at something here shaving cream that is not in this case
 		uh list both what they are in the English or British Imperial System whatever it's called units uh and the metric system units so this just says seven ounces
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i i think i've heard that in Canada what they did was primarily they didn't change the size the sizes that various products came in they just changed the way they were annotated
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so something before was you know was and see you have things in odd measurements that's even true like for film and like you know sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter film
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		those odd things come about i'm not sure exactly what they are because it's like a half inch or whatever they just
 		you know they say okay millimeter this is a European thing too
 		so uh we'll just used to keep using the standard size but we'll just call it something else so you have odd things like sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter where originated in the metric system it'll probably be something regular but i guess that's that's not too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		not too important but i think uh at least in northern or northeastern schools uh they people are relatively uh well inducted into the metric system
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		anyone who takes you know chemistry physics anything like that in school i think in most cases it's done in in metric system it was for me
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i learned metrics you know in high school and and before that so i'm familiar with the system i'm still using inches and pounds and the like
 		i the only thing we as Americans have become accustomed to as far as the metric system is now we buy two liter bottles of Coke you know
 	
 	
 		yeah when you tell somebody liters bottles of Coke yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's true that is and oddity
 	
 	
 		i mean it sounds you know a gallon sounds like that's too much but two liters and and you know doesn't sound as bad as three quarts or
