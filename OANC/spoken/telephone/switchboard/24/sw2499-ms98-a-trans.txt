 
     		
 	
 		and all right what have you seen
 	
 	
 		okay the latest movie i've seen that i thought was fantastic was Dances With Wolves
 	
 	
 		that's i knew you were going to say that i wanted i want to go see that
 	
 	
 		oh man
 		i i just finally ended up going to see it uh and  one day my husband had the kids and i just went because we couldn't we could never get to go see it together because it's so long by the time we had a  babysitter for that long
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		so i finally just went to see it and i just thought it was fantastic
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i watched uh Costner on the Academy Awards i was really happy that he got i was hoping he was going to get Best Actor uh but he he he did pretty good on that one
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		that was quite a the buffalo scene in that thing was so real it's like  i mean it just blew me away
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'd i bet
 		yeah there several of them that are out right now that i want to see uh Dances uh Silence of the Lambs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh i'm i'm afraid to go see that one that one looks so scary just from the previews i thought gosh i'd probably have nightmares for the next six months
 	
 	
 		nah nah
 		nah i mean that's what people
 	
 	
 		it's supposed to be good though i know some friends who went to see it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they said it was really riveting
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know they they that's what they said about The Exorcist you know no no it's terrible you'll have nightmares you know i watched last weekend me and my roommate we we laughed about it
 	
 	
 		well you're not a thirteen year old i don't know i saw it when i was a kid and i thought oh man
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i'll tell well i guess i i guess it was because i'd read the book before i saw the movie
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was yeah he's a very good writer and he had a way of putting you in that scene you know it was
 	
 	
 		oh really huh gosh
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		yeah and of course i was i was living alone at the time and it was late at night and scary and  you know  you start hearing noises you know
 	
 	
 		oh gosh call the crisis line
 		yeah i bet
 	
 	
 		and there's rats in the attic you know
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		uh let's see there was a couple of others that are out and i can't remember
 	
 	
 		i saw one i thought was crummy with that new uh Michael J Fox movie The Hard Way where he plays a a actor that's uh like the huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i didn't i didn't even like the previews on that
 	
 	
 		oh i know it was well i ended up at the theater and there was didn't seem to be anything else on  i wanted to see so i'll try that but it wasn't worth anything i didn't care for that at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 		i i don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah well the last two i saw him in one of those Back to the Future Part Three deals and that was crummy also i didn't think that was any good so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i saw the original Back to the Future and then i i know i hardly ever go see a sequel
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i think i think the only i've ever seen a sequel was Two Thousand and One
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		uh Two Thousand and Ten was far better
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		Two Thousand and One was a good movie if you had read the book
 	
 	
 		well i hadn't read it and i couldn't figure what was going on half the time so
 	
 	
 		yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean the the book was so much uh there's just things all you can do is put it in words you can't put it in pictures and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you could say what is this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know what's the significance of the apes you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i should probably go back and read the book now  that i just saw the movie again not too long ago
 	
 	
 		oh the book is really good i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again and that's one of them it's it's so well written
 	
 	
 		wow huh
 		huh
 		huh well i have one i bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids Otis and Milo
 	
 	
 		oh you're right i haven't
 	
 	
 		oh that is that is the most precious movie it has was to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life and it's all this it's the story of this little cat and dog and it's not
 		like cutesy it's just uh it's just so realistic everything they do you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things and it was
 	
 	
 		huh oh those a real dog and cat huh
 	
 	
 		a real dog and cat and all the other animals they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised and then the cat gets um on this treacherous journey he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river and he winds up
 		all over creation i don't know where in the world it is somewhere in China somewhere i think that it was filmed
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh it's just really an incredible thing
 	
 	
 		sounds sounds sort of like The Incredible Journey
 	
 	
 		yeah it was pretty wild  and of course the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but there's no you know nothing else  to keep it going but it really keeps
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		keeps me going i i've seen it twice now
 	
 	
 		yeah that that sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film
 		sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah it was like the best of the Walt Disney ones Walt Disney's kind of
 		gotten worse in my opinion in the past few years
 	
 	
 		oh yeah not anymore i mean i i i was raised on Walt Disney films you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Old Yeller uh Big Red
 	
 	
 		yeah all those old good ones that you you know wish they had on more now but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		when i was a little kid i saw The Incredible Journey on Christmas Eve and it was so good
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it was so good that i had forgotten that it was Christmas Eve i mean that's something for a kid
 	
 	
 		that's pretty good
 		really
 	
 	
 		and that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time i'll tell you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		let's see what are some other ones i've seen lately i'm trying to remember i can't oh i just saw one on the video oh um have you seen The Gods Must Be Crazy Part Two
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		that is a riot yeah the first one was really good but the second one  is really good too i was really surprised
 	
 	
 		is it
 		
 
 		yeah i didn't much care for the first one maybe that's
 	
 	
 		no i thought it was funny but that's my sense of humor i guess
 	
 	
 		well i i'll have to go get that one i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore and i'm just i guess i'm just middl e America or something i just go to be entertained and
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's
 	
 	
 		and not really interested in some of the like the Terminator or some of the Schwarzenegger  stuff i just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i get so tired of you know these you know sequels number nine number ten number fourteen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		Freddy's Revenge Part Twenty Five  or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah you know yeah you know Freddy Eats a Nuclear Warhead you know i i'm just
 	
 	
 		yeah i never
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i'm so sick and tired of that i just can't believe it it's like Rocky films i i haven't seen a one i can't stand Stallone
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i've never seen any of those
 		yeah i can't either he seems so macho i just
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i was afraid that Rambo was going to do the same thing that Rocky was going to do you know go into fourteen hundred episodes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now i don't i hardly ever watch TV if i ever get the hankering to see something i've got i don't know maybe about thirty or forty movies and i just
 	
 	
 		yeah when they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't even rent them you know i i figure if i find a movie i like i'll buy it because i just watch them over and over again
 	
 	
 		that's like my husband does that he can watch them over and over and i'm there's very few i would want to see that many times so he he once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		yeah my my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh Excalibur i i loved that film um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that was a good one i haven't seen that one in a long time
 	
 	
 		it's just so well done and i lived over in England for four years that was the first place i ever saw it and it was just gosh it was so good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh boy
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was it was filmed in Ireland
 	
 	
 		oh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and they got pretty scenery in Ireland yeah it's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		and i i've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was
 	
 	
 		oh boy so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that
 	
 	
 		yeah it was yeah it was unimpressive to look at i mean the whole thing was about the size of a a medium house  yeah it wasn't no
 	
 	
 		oh really well when i was in England years ago and i went to to like Shakespeare's and you know Stratford-On-Avon and all that  and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it because it was so short the ceilings were so short but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah there's some nice stuff over there to see i i spent four years traveling around and didn't see you know hardly anything i just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		i need to go over there and stay about twenty years so i can just travel go around all the places Stonehenge of course you know every everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		okay big deal here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field okay  it's boring
 	
 	
 		did you see any movies over there  i remember i went to see Don Quixote over there when it came out it came out right around the time with Sophia Loren
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that was a riot to see that
 	
 	
 		you know something i come to think of it i don't think i went to the movies one time
 	
 	
 		yeah because when you're touristing you probably don't want to take the time to
 	
 	
 		i uh where i lived uh it was a little town called Newmarket
 	
 	
 		go see a movie but
 	
 	
 		about seventy miles north of London and there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us and they had a little uh theater company
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh boy
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there and we use to go go out to that about once a week yeah a really nice place you know amateurs but really quite good uh but that was interesting course used to
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		yeah
 		that sounds great
 	
 	
 		go to London quite a lot and see shows down there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but other than that i just didn't have time to go to the movies you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		never show any anyway anything that i ever wanted i rented a lot of videos  because the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds and who wants who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh boy
 		
 
 		probably some of them did
 	
 	
 		a lot of a lot of people did but it would have to be a good show
 	
 	
 		yeah it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i use they they they have all these neat phrases you know you know you know like critically acclaimed that's what they when the thing hasn't won any award
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		you know they can't
 	
 	
 		it's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're you know if you're two miles away from water
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah from Love Canal
 	
 	
 		water view
 	
 	
 		waterfront property here at Love Canal you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know critically acclaimed oh good grief give me a break
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's what i mean there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies and primarily i mean i now i'm probably going to going to upset you but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
