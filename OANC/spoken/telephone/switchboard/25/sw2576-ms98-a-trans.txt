 
     		
 	
 		here we go
 	
 	
 		okay um now we're supposed to talk about social activities right
 	
 	
 		well the changes that's occurred like it how was it maybe ten twenty thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how we're living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period from ten twenty or whatever you remember it to be
 	
 	
 		i think um well i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation i think your generation is um what do i say uh
 		uh they're they're they're polite they have more respect for other people just in in general i think and just just towards
 		people and property and um i i guess they would would be more conservative some of them i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah we are uh somewhat conservative but as far as the
 		uh socially our crime rate has increased and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		violent crime is on the increase from what i've seen and um our prison population has significantly increased i would say
 		um our economy too
 		is really it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what i've read and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh even the well it started
 		spiraling down i suppose in the seventies
 		and uh our recovery
 		uh economically has not been like it used to be
 		to me also our nuclear family is is not the same because more people are living together that aren't married uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't know if uh can't make any judgments of that nature but uh
 		i don't really want to either  because i have no problems about it either way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		kids are i i suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to
 	
 	
 		yes i agree with
 	
 	
 		women are more on the rise too so far as getting their careers established and uh they don't no longer feel dependent upon men
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well
 		well do you think that that maybe i mean uh i've heard different you know like um
 		like i know my mom and like other ladies they complain because they think that um the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids
 	
 	
 		that's probably true i mean they they are a lot of them that have to
 		put their kids into day care or having more with baby sitters and especially if they don't have boy friends or husbands and uh i guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		in fact uh there was one lady in this area she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh just a baby
 	
 	
 		not a baby uh she was old enough to
 		uh i would say she was five to eight years old somewhere along that range but that's just an extreme example i would imagine you know the situations are out there
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well as
 		um well i think the education like our education has um increased dramatically but then i think also that we're forgetting like basic things like we should know
 	
 	
 		i agree there
 	
 	
 		like i i think well um in the morals and values of like my generation for the most for most people are totally different
 		from the morals and valleys um values of like per se your generation but i think as we get older it gets to your you know what i mean i think
 		the kids now are are i would say louder now until after they reach like twenty five and then i think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things
 	
 	
 		yeah um i could agree with that because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah because i think we're given more now whereas you had to work for everything and kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work and you know and they they don't have any intent to go working until they have to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's an agreeable
 		topic there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um what else considering beside family economics
 		um our transportation system has changed for us i mean we can it we can now travel around the world in no time
 		it's just a hop skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well i i think what's happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up
 		aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and to keep abreast of the
 		knowledge out there we got to constantly read go to school
 		uh TV watching has sure hasn't gone too much out the door because TV
 		is still well the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular TV programming
 		and watch a lot of other a variety of programs out there as well as use of the VCR
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that i don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system
 	
 	
 		i don't know because i know i don't watch while i'm up here at school i don't watch hardly any TV like Thursday night i like to sit down and watch a few shows but other than that
 	
 	
 		do you watch LA Law
 	
 	
 		no i don't watch that  i used to but i don't any more
 	
 	
 		i like that
 	
 	
 		but
 		all i mean there are even though there's a few up here we call them couch potatoes they love to sit in front of the TV i i said but for the for the most part i will i will well i live in an all girls dorm but for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen and like twenty one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there isn't really a lot of TV watching
 	
 	
 		well that's good at least you're hitting the books right
 	
 	
 		yeah well they're either hitting the books or something else i don't know what but i know oh well i guess they have their crowds like during the soap operas you know like in between classes or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the TV all day
 	
 	
 		well that's a change then oh of course going to school too
 		it's different from the home environment
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but then um like i know this girl she's doing her student teaching or she's just working like within the school
 		and um yesterday she was at the kindergarten and there's this little boy he like didn't want to do anything and he said i'm not doing this i don't like it and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand and pretend like he's playing Nintendo
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know so
 		uh i don't know how i mean i never really watched that a lot of TV when i was younger but my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much TV so i don't know
 	
 	
 		i agree with your parents
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because uh TV kind of ruined me because that's that's all that we had
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well not really but i mean
 		it's uh for the top medium of entertainment
 	
 	
 		yeah well we watch a lot of i guess we watched a lot of TV in the winter time but in the summer like right now my mom well like she doesn't let us watch TV until like eight o'clock at night you know are like
 	
 	
 		it was
 		even at your age
 	
 	
 		well like my younger brothers and sisters at home like when it starts getting nice outside in the summer and everything she'll she makes us go outside even now when i go home for the summer she makes us go outside and we're allowed to come in and watch TV until it's dark because she doesn't like the TV herself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and if it was up to her we wouldn't have one so you know she feels that kids are too dependent on it also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		is there anything else
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		what about in our work ethics
 	
 	
 		work ethics oh  right now it's getting it's maybe getting better
 	
 	
 		i i
 	
 	
 		um
 		a little of course we're we're we're having to weather through the savings and loans and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		all the other scandalous items that well
 		the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i think i think it's going to have to have it's patchwork
 		put on us
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		because we have so much to pay for now
 		it's going to be really passed on to your generation and maybe a few others
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		including what's left of ours
 	
 	
 		well i really can't think of anything else
 	
 	
 		well it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it was nice talking to you too
 	
 	
 		and uh what are majoring in
