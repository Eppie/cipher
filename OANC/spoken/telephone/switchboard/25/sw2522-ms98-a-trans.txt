 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think maybe that we could do better with the budget if we didn't buy so much stuff overseas
 	
 	
 		well i don't know how much that would do for the budget though i mean that has helped the economy as a whole you know American jobs and all but
 	
 	
 		well then maybe they wouldn't have to take so many taxes out and stuff like that
 		well
 	
 	
 		yeah if we bought more American stuff i guess that's more American taxes
 		well i guess you know it's like your own home budget you know you can either earn more money or you can uh
 		spend less
 		and you know just like you and i have to make choices like that i think the government has to do it too
 	
 	
 		well i agree i think that's what i'm trying to say
 	
 	
 		yeah the question is which which  excuse me that's my little girl which one should they do
 	
 	
 		spend less
 		i think we  well i think we give too much money away
 	
 	
 		to
 	
 	
 		other countries yeah
 	
 	
 		to other countries
 	
 	
 		we don't ever get anything from anybody when we're having to fight to get money to help us with this war we were just in
 	
 	
 		well that's that's the
 		that's because
 		we're supposed to be the rich ones with all the money to give away
 	
 	
 		right well it's not true though we're not anymore
 	
 	
 		we're still we are still the biggest ones
 		as you know as far as how much money we've got in the whole country we're still bigger than anybody else
 	
 	
 		we can't even take care of the people that are hungry and homeless here
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's an important thing we've got we've got a lot of people who are getting money the from the government for this that and the other thing
 	
 	
 		uh i mean
 	
 	
 		and uh it would probably help if we could figure out how to get them to put money back into the system instead you know
 		you take someone on welfare and you give them a job and they're paying income taxes all of a sudden you've changed it around and it's going in the other direction
 	
 	
 		but see right right now we're having a hard time finding people jobs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if you're a TI worker you how well you know are you are you a TI worker yeah so am i  so we know you know that times are really tough right now and yet we're still sending money here and there i just know it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i am
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it's just crazy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and more and more people without i have several friends without jobs now that in this last riff
 		went out looking for jobs and jobs are really hard to come by now really hard to come by
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's what i don't understand
 	
 	
 		and that's scary
 	
 	
 		yeah you wonder you know when is it going to happen to me
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		it's already happened to me once but i was lucky
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i got to stay in TI but you know not everybody's that lucky anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they're and i don't know the welfare system is just so abused
 	
 	
 		well i i i don't think the problem so much is abuse
 		i think the problem is is just the government is trying to do too much
 		um i mean who where does it say that the government's supposed to be the one to take care of all of the people that are homeless or hungry or et cetera et cetera
 		and and where does it say that that if someone is short that they can go to the government and and get a handout
 	
 	
 		well i know but then okay but that's here but then other countries are doing it to us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		their when their people are hungry and all they're asking us for handouts so why shouldn't our own people be able to ask for a handout
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i think we should take care of our own things right here in our own country and then if we have anything left over to share with other countries then maybe we should consider sharing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i just don't i think we're and then they keep raising the taxes boy i'll tell you what i barely make ends meet and they raise taxes and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		wages aren't going up that much and it's hard
 	
 	
 		no they're not
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean you know especially if you're alone it's on one salary it's terribly hard to pay the bills and pay your house payment and a car payment and insurance is ridiculous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know  and
 	
 	
 		you know i think you know i've got a fairly decent job here at TI but uh when i think of you you go to the the grocery store and you see someone working as a cashier and you think you you know how much a cashier makes and you go how do these people get by
 	
 	
 		not very much
 		they
 	
 	
 		because i know how hard it is for me to get by
 	
 	
 		yep it's hard it's really hard i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well uh no i don't know i guess if we had the answers we'd
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we could save the country but
 	
 	
 		we could go run for office
 	
 	
 		yeah  well they all say great things when they run for office
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well the thing is um you know who's really in charge of deciding how the money gets spent
 		and and it's you know it's not the president the president just suggests it the ones who actually you know debate it and decide it is the is the Congress
 		and you know what the Congress is out for they're
 		they're going to do whatever it takes to make their voters happy which means bring more jobs and more federal spending to their little area
 		and uh
 		uh and that means every Congressman is sitting there working for money going to his area nobody's working on less money going to his area or on anybody else's area
 		and if you just if you just looked at how much Congress spends on itself it's ridiculous
 	
 	
 		yeah i know that
 		you know and then they cut their defense i i'm not sure if that was such a great idea that cut us really bad i just i hated to see that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well now the thing is
 		yeah they're cutting defense which is you know there are people out there working for defense contractors who are losing money but i don't i don't mind because i think you know government is not there to give me a job Government
 		the defense is there to defend our country and they do it for whatever you know they spend whatever money they need to to do that but i don't want them to to break the budget just so that i can have a job
 		i would rather have the the government stable
 		so that i can go get a good job with someone who's not working you know not making defense stuff
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah i do but i still hated to see it  i mean one of the reasons i voted for Bush was because
 	
 	
 		if you know what i mean
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Reagan was so defense conscious and we were doing so well and i thought well Bush is going to just carry right on  he didn't  was i surprised i uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well he didn't have much choice really
 	
 	
 		well i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but but defense is not the biggest part of the federal budget either the biggest part of the budget are things like Medicare and Social Security
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		but those are things that we we really need i hate to see the old people that don't have anybody and hey you know there are  people out there that have no family or and they really depend on their Medicare
 	
 	
 		well
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and their Social Security and maybe they're in a nursing home somewhere and they cut some of this stuff and what happens to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well you know how fast your TI medical insurance has been going up right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well just think the federal government's insurance bill has Medicare and that's been going through the roof
 		and that's why federal you know that's that's the biggest increase in federal spending right there
 	
 	
 		so what's the answer
 		
 
 	
 	
 		think we need to figure out a way to uh to make medical care cheaper
 		why is this stuff so expensive why is the cost going up so incredibly fast
 		you know because it's it's coming out of my paycheck it's coming out of your paycheck and it's coming out of our taxes too
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 	
 	
 		why why is these hospitals making so much money
 	
 	
 		isn't it England that has it all state run or something
 	
 	
 		oh there's a whole lot of countries in Europe that do that Sweden Denmark Norway
 	
 	
 		but
 		they what is it is it free to the people to people or how do they work that
 	
 	
 		it's it's free for everybody
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in the state
 		or the country
 	
 	
 		everybody in the country like i i lived in Denmark for a couple of years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and medical care there is free you just go and say i want your help and they'll help you there's couple of things though first of all it's not
 		as high a quality as we expect here because it's paid for by the government instead of by us
 		and second um your taxes are a lot higher
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		an awful lot higher we're talking fifty percent something like that
 	
 	
 		so they are paying for it okay well the way i you know it was talked about
 	
 	
 		they are paying for it
 		and and the and the just the quality of care is not as good either
 	
 	
 		well then that's not the answer
 	
 	
 		there has got to be a middle ground i think Canada's got a good answer but i don't know many details about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what do they do
 	
 	
 		it's it's some sort of government program i've heard a lot of people say good things about it but i just don't know the details on it
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		i don't know i don't know if anything will ever happen to to change change change things i i guess it's going to have to change
 	
 	
 		well something's going to have to change but you look at the Congress and you look how many of them get reelected and they're the one's that have got to make the changes
 		i mean i don't see anything changing because you've got the same old people in there
 	
 	
 		and the other thing that concerns me terribly is automobile insurance now i don't know how much longer i'm going to be able to afford it at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's eating me alive because i i might be almost fifty but i'm single
 		and i don't think and this company's that just because and i own my own home and i have a garage  and because i'm single there's companies that won't take me no matter how old you are
 	
 	
 		single
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they won't take you because they say you're a risk you go out and party i said i don't even drink i mean i don't even go out but they won't take you i mean i was turned down this year
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		by an agent who represented i'm not sure of the companies he represented but i was told because you're single they absolutely won't take you i said that is that's prejudicial that's terrible what's going to happen if they all start doing this
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum what's really terrible is they can do this to you you know and you don't really have that much of a choice as to whether or not you take it because the government government says if you're going to drive a car you've got to have the insurance
 	
 	
 		but yet they're not helping us with the companies
 	
 	
 		they're they're not helping you uh be able to afford the insurance that they're making you buy
 	
 	
 		that's right
