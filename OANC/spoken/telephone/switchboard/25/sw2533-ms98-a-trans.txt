 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay um what baseball team are you familiar with
 	
 	
 		well i'm only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because i lived up in Boston for a while
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and um the Mets
 	
 	
 		oh now come on no Texas Rangers
 	
 	
 		after that if you asked me that i wouldn't have been able to tell you if that was football or  baseball
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		really i guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later but um i understand a little bit about the Texas Rangers i know George Bush threw out the first pitch the other night and it bounced off the ground
 		and that um that i heard a joke on the radio yesterday that
 		in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system and uh the which was kind of cruel i mean think the the shame that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground i mean golly
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how humiliating for a man to do that any man i don't care if you're President
 	
 	
 		yeah but at the same time i don't know it's pretty far to throw that far  i couldn't do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know but he's a man come on men know how to do that right
 	
 	
 		right he's supposed to be able to do that
 	
 	
 		i know so i felt kind of sorry for him i said oh no that must have been hard on him because he's just a person but um i know his son is a major owner of our team of the team here
 	
 	
 		oh really i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		yeah he's like i thought he was the owner but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner but he must own the biggest chunk because that's all you hear about is
 		if you know about Neal Bush i think is his name see i even know his name because he's on the news a lot and i never hardly watch the news not you know not like some people hour and a half a day or anything
 	
 	
 		I have
 		yeah and i've been watching uh my husband's French and so if i've been watching the French news when i watch it it's incentive speaking of Bush we're going to get a little off topic but speaking of Bush they that had
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a story where he went to visit some little uh elementary school students and stuff did you see that where he the guy asked him for proof of who he was and he showed his license
 	
 	
 		oh i saw that
 		yeah i want to see your driver's i i i don't i you're not President Bush
 	
 	
 		i know and i want to see a credit card
 	
 	
 		i know and he pulled that out that is so funny i heard it on the radio i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car but i didn't see it but
 	
 	
 		it was so funny to see it was a really cute little kid too
 	
 	
 		that's about my extent of um about baseball i don't know that much about it
 	
 	
 		well i can tell you that the Mets opened i think two days ago because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game and i couldn't tell you who pitched but they won the Mets won but yeah not my a lot and then somebody else lost
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		did they
 		
 
 	
 	
 		maybe it was the other New York team which is the Yankees but i don't even know if they're still New York Yankees or the New Jersey yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's so stupid that you all have two teams
 		that's really stupid
 	
 	
 		well but it then then they can have them play against each other
 	
 	
 		yeah i know
 	
 	
 		i think it's still the New York Yankees you know for some reason i thought they were moving to New Jersey  this is how much i know about baseball
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the Texas Rangers they they lost i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i know that last year we did go to a baseball game last year we got free tickets because someone at our church one of the deacons at church um parks cars at the Mansion at Turtle Creek which is like one of the uh the places and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he's their head chauffeur is this funny as they're parking the cars the valet service
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah he makes good money too doing that you'd be shocked i was shocked but anyway someone gave an Iranian a tip of four Rangers tickets last year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then the Iranian couldn't he didn't want them so he gave them to Alan and Alan and his Dad had plans that night so they gave them to us so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian
 	
 	
 		with baseball tickets
 	
 	
 		valet with baseball tickets and we ended up with them right and so we were walking up and i looked at my husband and i said you know what Kyle
 	
 	
 		yeah it's pretty funny
 	
 	
 		this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek a tip i bet these are really good seats and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor and you know we just they called us at five and the game started at seven so we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		left and so we took two kids with us and nobody brings two children in these seats you know because
 	
 	
 		because they're fancy seats and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah and you just sit down and all the girls were all dressed up and all this you know i just was there you know like i made it i'm here you know and uh it was just kind of funny because
 		you know but we got to sit by first base if they'd hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in you know
 	
 	
 		i know i'm always scared of that whenever i go to a game i rarely go but we went last year because
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my brother my brother is impossible when um he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff and if there's a game on he's watching it i mean that's all there is to it and he's like glued at the TV
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		really
 		oh i'm glad my husband's not like that
 	
 	
 		oh i'm glad my husband's not like that either i'd kill him  my brother's like that and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		see he goes to a lot of games not a real lot but he tries to go then my father got us some tickets so my brother's wife and my husband and i went last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because you know being a non American
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you want to see what a baseball game is like and he describes it as you sit there in a crowd and it was nice weather and stuff it wasn't a real problem but you sit there in a crowd
 		and you're waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat these lousy the hot dogs  um because we made him try a hot dog you know and things like that and um
 	
 	
 		that's funny
 	
 	
 		and um so you sit there and you wait for the longest time really bored and then all of a sudden something happens but you happen to look the other way during the time yeah and so you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen and when it happened he missed it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you miss the whole thing
 		that's funny
 	
 	
 		and didn't understand it and it
 	
 	
 		where is he from in France
 	
 	
 		um he grew up out well he grew up in Le Ren which is the sort of um oh strip east to west eastern part of France
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i have a i had a friend in college from Strasbourg
 	
 	
 		yeah he's not that far he was sort of in between Strasbourg and Paris
 	
 	
 		uh-huh Paris and my cousin lives in Paris and she's lived there for like oh off and on for twenty years
 	
 	
 		oh is she still there
 	
 	
 		uh huh Saint Claude is that sound familiar yeah
 	
 	
 		because
 		yeah Saint Claude yeah we used to that's one of the um entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and it it it it sits right at the limit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know exactly where she is but um
 	
 	
 		that's neat yeah she does and they have twelve children
 	
 	
 		we we met in Paris
 		twelve children oh my God the poor woman
 	
 	
 		she has twelve children she looks gorgeous no she's gorgeous a nd she just liked having kids and she's thin and i mean all my friends with four or more children are thin i mean i'm not kidding you
 	
 	
 		were any of them twins
 		you probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them
 	
 	
 		no you have i have a friend now that has seven and um and they're all eight and under
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or nine and under they're all real young they're just really feel like that's what God's told them to do but they're not condemning you if you we only have one child you know they don't say they don't put airs on about it or anything which is good because it would be easy i'm sure for them to do that
 		you know you get a conviction like that and you think everyone should have it and so i'm real proud of them because they're aren't really they don't do that at all you go in their bathroom and there's ten tooth brushes in there and i always give her a hard time i go now come on who's toothbrush did you really use this morning
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but how do they afford to even have the kids uh we're expecting our first baby almost any day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		they live lean for one thing and they tithe and they really believe the Bible says that tithe puts it puts a hole in your money bag we don't honor God with the first portion and so they i think that helps a lot i think that's the key
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		and he like his sales last year he just works a normal job he probably has an income of thirty five thousand but last year he made one sale that got him a bonus of twenty five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know it's God i mean it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done and he got to do it and so God just really blesses him in ways like that just trust God because i don't know kids are a blessing and and some people we think of blessings as
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		nice furniture and things like that but kids are just as much of a blessing as all these material things but it's a different kind and a lot times people think oh well i'm not blessed i have an old car but you've got five kids you know you're just as blessed probably more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because if you follow this there's a good book called What the Bible Has to Say About Child Training by Richard Fugate and he's you know a lot of wisdom in it and the kids in the Bible talk about anything but training and training is different
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		than anything else in in psychology doesn't address it a lot of the psychology stuff the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the Bible and they don't quote you the proverb out of it but
 		the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work they just come out of the Bible and so this book it just really ties in all these things and how to train the child so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know what i mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing and so you know they do that and they they just live lean pretty much they don't she doesn't shop at Foley's you know and stuff like that
 		but a lot women in Dallas shop at Foley's so Foley's it's like a Macy's kind of store it's pretty nice and everything's pretty expensive and you know you just can't do that and you don't go to baseball games as much or you get pictures like we did you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't know what Foley's is
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you do these fun things you know in other kinds of ways and i know Manhattan's real expensive but um it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment right
 	
 	
 		yeah well that makes a really big difference but but still it's just as hard as having that but well he can your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well have a church state softball leagues so they're not all boys and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right now we don't have a girl's league because i'm the one that's supposed to start one and i just haven't gotten around to doing it i keep saying we need to have one they go okay then start one but everybody wants to do it but you know God's sitting on my heart and i just hadn't gotten around to doing it
 		anyway so they could really only have four members on the team i think they only have four boys i don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um they you wouldn't believe it though her kids are the they are so good i'm not kidding you but she does work with them and it's a commitment and that that's what they're called to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i have a most of my friends
 	
 	
 		i admire someone that can do that you know i really can
 	
 	
 		i know i do too i most of my friends have three or four kids and they feel like you know that's really all that God wants for them and some of the people in our church use birth control and some of them don't i had my tubes tied so you
