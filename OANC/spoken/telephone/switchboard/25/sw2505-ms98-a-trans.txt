 
     		
 	
 		talk about the activities that we don't do  uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i don't have any children so but i i have a lot of friends with children  and i know they spend a lot of time with them  which is good
 	
 	
 		that's good to hear yeah and  i haven't uh well i've been  around a lot of people lately at work at my job that don't have a lot of values
 	
 	
 		you know
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it's it's always nice to see people that like each other  and like uh families that get along with each other and like to do things together
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they have a lot of values i love that  do they have children
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um the one the the most valueless girl doesn't  but she's married now i i'm not quite sure why  i i think he said that he'd give her a big ring and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she got married to him
 	
 	
 		oh that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		but  it's it's it's it's kind of weighed on me and then the  other day my husband and i met a couple who who're they're just gonna have their first child and  they really like each other
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they're real happy with one another and she says things like  i'm really glad when he comes home and there's not enough time to spend with him in the evening and  i'm like
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		that's good you know i like to see that you know i have uh some friends that uh first of all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh the girls joined they have two girls one joined the Girl Scouts and the other was in the Brownies  and then the mother got involved as a leader and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with  doing nature hikes for them and working with the Girl Scout camp
 		here in Dallas and then going out to  um Betty Perot Camp and working with the horses and stuff and they're gone a lot and they take their girls and they go away for weekends and  in the winter time even you know to do work with the Girl Scouts and i think it's neat
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they've really become very much involved in in just that one organization  which the organization can use the help too  so i i wish i could see more of that you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		well on Sunday we just met uh a family we were thinking about getting Maine Coon Cat
 		and we went over to a lady that breeds them here in town and  uh her daughter actually it was her she said that her husband said to her daughter  you need a hobby
 	
 	
 		
   
 	
 	
 		so she chose the cats and you can tell it's a family hobby
 		the cats they're all a part of it and it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and and the cats and
 		they raise champion cats
 	
 	
 		ooh  those are neat cats too
 	
 	
 		so they've done really well
 		yeah i've just learned about that breed
 	
 	
 		they're really nice looking cats i have seven cats but they're all mongrels
 	
 	
 		well that's what we're gonna end up getting
 	
 	
 		well they're the ones that need the homes
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know mine were just all um strays in the neighborhood little baby
 		kittens dropped and stuff and it just kind of built  one at a time just kind i couldn't you know one time two of them came  at once and i can't turn a hungry cat down
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		so you know and the last one that i picked was here uh
 		the kids brought him over and said he was injured  and it was winter time and i said i just cannot have another cat i just cannot have another cat  and i looked out there and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all and i said i can't stand it i brought him in so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		those are my children we don't have very many activities  but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i know what you mean our cat hates other cats and the we've tried to get her to like  other cats and she just
 		uh she wants to be around human beings and she does not wanna be around other cats so our next we're gonna try it with a kitten
 		and see if her maternal instincts come out
 	
 	
 		huh lots of luck is she spayed oh yeah real maternal
 	
 	
 		yeah  we're hoping it's our last hope
 	
 	
 		she'll eventually i mean mine you know i have five males and  two females everybody's spayed everybody's neutered  and
 		we still have a scrap every now and then nothing real bad you know a slap here and there but  um they put up with each other and they will eventually  her nose will be out of joint for a while and she'll hiss and growl and  slap every now and then but they'll she'll finally accept it
 		you know they really don't have any choice in my  in my household  we have a little bit of uh  a fight for who's boss mean a male cats are are real you know real territorial and so that's the big battle here
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know uh who's who's top dog  well top cat i guess you know but um we i don't i don't know i don't have a problem with it  i think they
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just learn to accept and i have two dogs too and they've  slapped the dogs around too  every now and then  so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		that's true they've got to keep them in line
 	
 	
 		yeah but she'll accept another cat eventually as long as you make her feel um  like she's still loved and everything  so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well those Maine Coon cats were great they were fourteen pounds and
 	
 	
 		and they're
 	
 	
 		oh they're just gorgeous but yeah  three hundred and fifty dollars for a kitten and i think of those i think of the kittens at the pound
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh  yeah three hundred and fifty dollars
 	
 	
 		i just
 		yeah yeah and they are lovely but
 	
 	
 		ooh house payment  that is is a lot of money
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah and then she's saying you know you can't let them outside and you can't do all this stuff and i'm like ooh
 	
 	
 		i don't let mine out anyway but  i let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then but my cats are inside i'm afraid  you know with neighbors
 		it people throw rocks at them and people run over them and i i just you know i just don't
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know so and and now they've lost the desire most of them don't even try to get you know to go out i just have two  that drive me crazy that i let out in the back you know but i won't let them get if they start going in the front and stuff i bring the m in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know i just worry i guess i'm too protective but  you know i see these cats that are  wandering around the neighborhood and too they can catch diseases really easy just by touching a nose to another cat they can contact leukemia
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		feline leukemia  so we know we try try real hard to keep them healthy
 	
 	
 		uh we just bought a acre a house with an acre to try to  so she'll she'll have some room to walk around and not off of a busy street we're we're choosing our house for our cat isn't that bad
 	
 	
 		oh how neat
 		people do it for their children i mean why not well you know why not why not
 	
 	
 		oh them too  well because i he loves she's one of those that loves outside and she doesn't go far but she just wants to be able to have that freedom
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah  well if you're off off a road you know away from a road and you're off of the main road you said away from a road  you know and you keep an eye on her it's probably okay  i'm just real
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i guess i'm in a neighborhood and it's  it's just real tough on animals here you know when i every time i see one run over i just you know it makes me sick  so
 	
 	
 		yeah it gets hard
 		especially with the cars oh i know
 	
 	
 		you know but  anyway we kind of got off the subject of children except that i consider them my children
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah our cats are our kids or  i we we got married a few months ago and i'm like well why can't Ashley be at the wedding
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh no  in her little bridesmaid dress

 		you know to have i was an only child my mother was an only child so i  you know i wasn't raised with  brothers or sisters and i always got all the attention so i wouldn't know  i think i would be extremely jealous or would have been  had there  been another child in the family
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's  we can see it work with her it's she's frustrated
 	
 	
 		tough
 		must be tough
