 
     		
 	
 		okay do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		yeah i have three cats and a dog
 	
 	
 		oh boy sounds like us yeah go ahead
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh we just got the the dog less than a year ago so he's still a puppy
 	
 	
 		oh what kind is it
 	
 	
 		he's a mixed breed he's part Collie part Shepherd and part Chow
 	
 	
 		oh so he's got
 	
 	
 		more Collie and Shepherd than Chow the only Chow he's got is is his tongue
 	
 	
 		oh he's got a blue tongue oh
 	
 	
 		yeah he's got little spots on them
 	
 	
 		we have two Chows and  a miniature Schnauzer and recently added a guinea pig  which wasn't by my choice but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was out ruled so  but the dogs are mine mainly mine and my husband but i just love them to death
 	
 	
 		was the guinea pig for your for your child
 	
 	
 		daughter yes  yes as if the dogs weren't enough had to have  a guinea pig so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		anyway she's she enjoys her though so that's that's what matters but um our Chows we've had them
 		i'd say right around six maybe seven years and they're um
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		registered and we've been breeding them she's had about four or five litters
 	
 	
 		oh my my husband's always wanted a Chow but i'm kind of concerned about um with having cats
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and how how they socialize with cats um which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed um because we we thought they would socialize easier
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um my husband had originally wanted an Akita and his brother has an Akita and he so far he's bitten ten people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		and the people that he got the Akita from used to have cats and they no longer have any other cats
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh
 	
 	
 		it's telling them yeah when we had um we had a cat when we first married no  yeah we had the cat first and then we got um the Chows and  bring them bringing them in as puppies
 		they got along just fabulous with her and uh you would think you know that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and and paw at their face and they'd just play and they were never they never harmed her
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh they got along great now i don't know how
 		how it would be bringing in uh
 		cat to a full full grown dog
 	
 	
 		yeah i i wouldn't want to bring a cat into a full grown dog but i i wouldn't feel
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um hesitant about bringing a puppy in to adult cats i think they would socialize easier
 	
 	
 		right
 		i think so too
 	
 	
 		um
 		how how old is your child
 	
 	
 		five she
 	
 	
 		five so you had the dogs before you had the baby
 	
 	
 		right and i was  not really concerned about
 		um them harming her uh i think i think a lot of that that that we hear all the time is how you bring them up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and ours are real friendly they're protective but they're very friendly and lovable i mean you think they're lapdogs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know they'll just come jump on your lap and want to be have their bellies rubbed and everything  and
 	
 	
 		what color are they
 	
 	
 		uh the female's red and the male is black
 	
 	
 		oh i bet the black one's pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah he is he's a big old thing and um i was concerned about the female mainly and as luck had it uh she had puppies the same week my daughter was born so it was kind of like she had her babies and understood about
 	
 	
 		about your baby
 	
 	
 		you know yeah and and i think that really helped and um my daughter you know since since she's little has been playing with them and
 		they let her tug their hair and and get on their back or whatever and she's she's grown up with them and loves them to death and they love her so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's good for kids to grow up around pets as as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything but i think it really helps them to
 	
 	
 		so
 		i do too
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		understand when when uh they go to other people's houses and they have pets i see so many times kids just
 		you know
 		being mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly that or or uh the other extreme they're they're terrified of them and i hate that and they shouldn't be i mean some maybe but but um
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		like our miniature Schnauzer she's just she's just like um
 		a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly and a lot of kids are scared of that
 		and which i understand because she is you know a lot of movement and everything but when she calms down they're so scared of her it's it that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing she wouldn't hit you know harm them at all
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and and and that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children
 		so i think i think it's a good idea to have them
 		we've had a um
 		in the past we've had birds too uh like cockatoos
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and parrots and uh
 	
 	
 		now are the are the cockatoos are those the big ones
 	
 	
 		the big white
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		birds with the the orange crest on top
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've had those and those are neat they're messy
 		very messy yeah and loud oh a lot louder than a dog you know a dog you can  stop barking you know or whatever but the birds you it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever but
 	
 	
 		are they
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they were neat enjoyable animals to have
 	
 	
 		well we've thought about getting an aquarium partly because partly for the cats i think the cats would really enjoy it um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah with a lid
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah of course  um but so far we just uh and and starting up an aquarium an aquarium we we're thinking about getting a saltwater and they're so expensive to start up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they
 		yes yes they are and in your  the luck of keeping them alive through those first you know few days
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		but the the saltwater fish have so much more color and they're so much more beautiful
 	
 	
 		i know they are
 	
 	
 		um the freshwater tank's just really to me they don't there's most of them really aren't that pretty
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		i really don't i really don't care much for them
 	
 	
 		right i don't blame you there i think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than
 		i don't know those fish fish are just beautiful just it's like you have a little bit of
 		ocean with you or something something rather than just little fish
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't mind having  my daughter had a
 		like a little goldfish
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		about a year or two ago and it finally died and that was neat but it and they're you know she can't play with it you can just look at it and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you can't roll around and
 		tussle around with it
 		like you can a dog or a cat and
 	
 	
 		yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't dare have a a goldfish here because uh it it it would probably be in a small bowl and then my cats would knock it over i have to be real careful about
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where i put things if the cats will will jump up on things and knock things over all the time
 	
 	
 		oh no oh no
 	
 	
 		they're always up where they don't where they're not supposed to be
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes yeah and that's hard
 	
 	
 		i know that's that's just like kids you know you you they know that they're not supposed to do it but they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right and they're so independent i love having them for that reason
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and until we got the dog um it was real easy to to go to town for three day three day weekend or whatever and now
 	
 	
 		sure
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		that's right that is hard
 	
 	
 		and i we knew it but we never even thought that about when we got the dog we just saw him oh he's so cute let's take him home  you know and then the first weekend we had him we had we were in a apartment in a two bedroom apartment
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and my husband went out of town
 		and left me with with the brand new puppy and i had to work twelve hours that day
 	
 	
 		oh fun
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and so i left the dog locked in the bedroom and i put paper all over the floor well when i came home i opened the door and there were chunks of carpet padding
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh oh no
 	
 	
 		everything all over the place and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door
 	
 	
 		oh no i guess you didn't get your deposit back did you
 	
 	
 		well i had the carpet fixed um i yeah i didn't even tell the apartment managers about it
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		oh okay  oh no bless your heart
 	
 	
 		but that that was my first real experience with with with a puppy when when we had our family dog growing up
 		i was eleven or twelve i think when we first got him and i wasn't really involved in the the the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		paper training and you know teaching him commands and stuff so this was and to me a whole new experience  only it wasn't like cats at all
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 		yes it is
 		no no i wish it was  i wish they were in that instinct
 		but they don't our only problem with our Schnauzer she's an indoor dog  most of the time  and
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we finally she's right at a year and we finally got her you know house trained and everything uh her only problem is trash
 		if you do not pick the trash up you know the container and put it on a table or chair or something she'll knock it over i don't care how full full she is so it's not like she's hungry it's just she wants to get into trouble
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		my cats do that it if i throw anything away that's any kind of meat or anything like that anything that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that they think is good they'll get into the trash and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it and how how tight you have the lid down on it they'll get into it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor
 	
 	
 		oh i hate that
 	
 	
 		and the cat's just looking at me like sorry
 	
 	
 		uh yeah  you shouldn't have left it there  i just hate that when she does that i just oh and she knows it's wrong you'll walk in the door and she'll cower and go hide under the table
 	
 	
 		i couldn't help myself
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you she knows she does wrong
 		but she uh she continues continues to do it so
 	
 	
 		yeah and the problem that we're having with our puppy right now he's not really he's actually not really a puppy anymore he's like sixteen months old
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		but he's still chewing
 	
 	
 		oh is he
 	
 	
 		um the last thing he chewed up was
 		uh when we
