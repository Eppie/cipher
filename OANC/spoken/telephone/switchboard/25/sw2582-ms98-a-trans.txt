 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hi Rick how you doing
 	
 	
 		pretty good
 	
 	
 		you say you live in your own home or you do not
 	
 	
 		no i don't i'm uh renting a townhouse right now but i'm moving uh the end of May i'm going to move into renting a house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wow i've i've never heard of that before
 	
 	
 		i'm uh
 		well actually this will be the second time i've done it
 	
 	
 		how does
 	
 	
 		i am uh in grad school right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and on my kind of salary you just  it's kind of hard to come up with money to make a house payment
 	
 	
 		well i i'll bet you end up spending more money renting a house than you would if you put a down payment on it and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well down payment is a tough problem i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah if you can get by that hurdle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can remember when i uh when i brought my house i needed help
 		uh and my folks helped me out to get started and now my rent uh well my mortgage if you will is uh cheaper than uh you know one room uh apartments
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well
 		i don't know you're in Massachusetts i think the the market is a little bit different here
 	
 	
 		it's a lot cheaper in uh in uh Texas
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh no i'm in i'm in Raleigh North Carolina
 	
 	
 		oh oh North Carolina
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh
 		it's probably what i'm paying now for an apartment is six twenty five
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and this this house we're moving into is only five hundred dollars a month
 	
 	
 		so you'll actually be saving money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how about the utilities for the uh for the house that you're in now
 	
 	
 		well the one now is is uh it's got a heat pump
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it's it's kind i mean it's not that cold in Raleigh in the wintertime but
 		i mean the air conditioning is probably your biggest threat
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the new place doesn't have air conditioning and has gas heating so it's going to be i know it's going to be cheaper
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		maybe hotter but
 	
 	
 		i i uh probably make you sick if i told you what my uh my mortgage is with with the taxes
 	
 	
 		yeah i can imagine i know how things are up there
 	
 	
 		i'm paying uh two hundred and thirty dollars a month
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		with taxes
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i bought
 	
 	
 		you have some kind of deal
 	
 	
 		no no deal it when i bought my home uh twenty five years ago it was it was very expensive
 	
 	
 		oh oh twenty five years ago okay yeah that makes
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm an old i'm an old guy
 	
 	
 		well that makes it more my parents have the same kind of deal too
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they've had their house that long
 	
 	
 		well it works that way with uh with anybody who buys it's very difficult when you first buy your house uh but once but once you do that and hang on to it you'd be surprised what inflation does to uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to the housing market and even though we're in a slump right now it's not going to last forever it's going to catch up sooner or later and uh you got you got to live in a house some day uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah see the problem i have now is uh i i want mobile because i'm not really
 		sure what is going to happen a year from now i've moved like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		three times in the last two years
 	
 	
 		when you rent the home do they uh force you to lease and guarantee payment
 	
 	
 		uh yeah they usually do put a a year lease on it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i was living in Colorado and i didn't have a lease which was really nice
 	
 	
 		oh the the lease
 	
 	
 		but i just kind of a verbal agreement yeah i'm going to stay a year and i'll be nice to you  if you'll be nice to me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the the lease can work uh work two ways it can work to your benefit too where uh they can't increase your your rent uh if something goes wrong with with a written lease but with an oral lease they can so it works both ways
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah huh well what would you suggest think it would be a good idea even i think i might be moving to buy a house
 	
 	
 		well buying a house is is should be your ultimate goal because you're going to have to live somewhere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh even if uh if you hang on to it for five years put a little bit of uh uh money into it you're going to get it back again
 		with uh with premium just like putting money in a bank it's forced forced savings
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		if uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know living in a house is something you're going to have to do whether you you're doing it alone whether you're doing it with a with a a partner or you're going to have to you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah see i'm single now and and see i may be going back and getting a PhD
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i know i can't afford a house if i'm going to be doing that
 	
 	
 		you you sound like a young guy and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm twenty five
 	
 	
 		all right when i was uh in my early twenty twenty one twenty two years old i was working for a a guy in a gas station
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he tried to convince me to buy this single family house that he saw for sale and uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh the price will sound odd because it was uh you know about thirty years ago but it they wanted uh forty nine hundred dollars for it
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and the buying a house was the last thing that i wanted to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i didn't buy it and i'm sorry now because I i you know i wasted a lot of money uh when you're twenty twenty one twenty two years old you you throw it away you and i wasn't paying rent i was living at home
 	
 	
 		you wish you did
 		paying it on rent
 		oh well that's the ideal thing
 	
 	
 		but uh but you know  i was throwing my money away
 		with that on girls cars you know typical things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i had to waste a lot of money on my car that was the biggest mistake i ever bought
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you buy a car it depreciates you buy a home and it inpreciates it it it
 	
 	
 		i know it was the s tupidest thing i why didn't someone tell me that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you you buy a car uh and have it a week and you've lost half of it already
 	
 	
 		i know i bought a a brand new i bought a Jeep
 		with everything on it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it was just i don't know big mistake
 		i don't even use it i rode my bike to class
 		so there
 	
 	
 		i live uh i live in a a ranch
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh five rooms upstairs one uh room downstairs a basement full cellar
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i i've been painting it white only because uh that's the way it was when i bought it it's a white with black shutters on it
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh i've got a garage under the house
 	
 	
 		so where where are you near
 	
 	
 		uh Boston
 	
 	
 		outside of Boston
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm about
 		thirty five miles south of Boston
 	
 	
 		oh are you are you near uh i have relatives in-laws that live there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh where about
 	
 	
 		what is it Duxbury
 	
 	
 		uh that's still a good hour ride i guess
 	
 	
 		north or south of you
 	
 	
 		i'm south they're north of me
 	
 	
 		okay
 		so you're like at the bottom of Cape Cod
 	
 	
 		no i'm not in Cape Cod i'm uh
 		oh about a you know five minute ride from Rhode Island
 	
 	
 		oh okay way down there i see
 		i see i was i was up there Christmas my sister got married in Duxbury
 	
 	
 		and
 		the housing market up here is uh is really slumped so you can buy a houses relatively inexpensive right now
 	
 	
 		huh
 		Raleigh well uh have you ever do you read uh US News
 	
 	
 		no i don't
 	
 	
 		Raleigh was in the top twenty five housing market
 		i mean it was a good place to buy a house but the problem is that the average house cost is really high
 	
 	
 		what about the tax structure
 	
 	
 		it's i mean it's it's good to buy a house if you have the money it's just that the houses are like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		two hundred to three hundred thousand dollar houses
 	
 	
 		wow what is the tax structure like up there how much a thousand
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm not really sure to tell you the truth
 	
 	
 		as my uh
 	
 	
 		being a renter not even caring about that
 	
 	
 		you don't care about that huh
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		my uh my taxes
 		exceed my mortgage payment
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it wasn't like that when i first
 	
 	
 		that's like my car where the insurance is almost  you go to the
 	
 	
 		yeah i can imagine it wasn't like that when i first bought my house uh
 		this gentleman that i was talking to when i did buy my house told me that's what happened to him
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and uh this was you know thirty years ago and it's happening to me my tax is exceeding my mortgage payment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm paying a hundred and twenty one dollars a month
 		uh i've got another uh year to pay on my house
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and my my uh taxes are a hundred and thirty five
 		
 
 	
 	
 		wow that that just doesn't seem to make make any sense why if you have to tax something for something you already own
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah but they're going to tax you just like they tax you your automobile they're going to tax your home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you've got maintenance expenses but the overall cost is is a a lot cheaper now and where you're single now's the time to do it when you're married you know got to have time you're not going to have money you're not going to have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i did see a house for sale in the area i wanted to move into but
 		i don't know where i could come up with the down payment
 	
 	
 		what is what the
 		what is the down payments look like now twenty five percent
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		you didn't even didn't even look huh
 	
 	
 		i didn't even look uh see i'm living with two other people so when i when we break five hundred dollars in in three ways
 	
 	
 		oh it isn't bad
 	
 	
 		yeah it's not bad at all
 	
 	
 		you're living with three other people
 	
 	
 		no two other people
 	
 	
 		two that's still tough
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can't even live with one
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i don't know i still like being a student i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's it's nice to get somebody to help you with the rent and everything but uh at the end of ten years what are you going to have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		nothing
 	
 	
 		what are you majoring in school
 	
 	
 		i'm in computer science actually i'm uh today i had uh i'm in a Masters program
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and today was my thesis defense and i passed
 	
 	
 		wow oh i see
 	
 	
 		so we're getting ready for a big party
 		as you can imagine
 	
 	
 		so you're graduating this year
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm going to graduate this semester so actually i'm going into the uh job market
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what i really want to do is pay off my car and then
 	
 	
 		lots of
 		lots of lots of luck on the job market
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		although the computer uh science areas are booming right now but the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the thing that's holding everything back right now is the economy
 	
 	
 		yeah i i really didn't have any problem i mean i had companies knocking on my door i didn't even like interview they came looking for me
 	
 	
 		no kidding now that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they're they're always looking for a lot of uh good computer people because there's a lot of equipment out there and no one knows how to run it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i run a little uh computer business at at my home at night
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm working with uh Texas Instruments home computer
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and i do repair work sell software and hardware
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh we're supposed to be talking about houses though right  well i run the business in my home
 	
 	
 		out of your out of your house
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so what kind of a house do you expect to buy when you do buy
 	
 	
 		uh something on a lake
 	
 	
 		all right  um-hum
 	
 	
 		or on a body of water this is the ideal house right
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		big garage a big basement just like my parents house except for on the water
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well maybe some day you'll own your parents' homes
 	
 	
 		that's true because i think they're going to move to Arizona when they get old
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my dad is into hot air ballooning and that's like balloon heaven is Arizona
 	
 	
 		wow
 		so it doesn't sound like he's ready to retire yet
 	
 	
 		no well he retired from one job and then took another one you know took that early retirement deal now has two salaries
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
  
 		wow do you do ballooning too
 	
 	
 		uh i've crewed for him some
 	
 	
 		oh
