 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so who is your favorite football team
 	
 	
 		guess i bet you can't guess
 	
 	
 		well i would say the Saints after
 	
 	
 		you got it
 		and i want to tell you something
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		they're going to go somewhere pretty shortly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i think they are because they're getting better every year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh they got a lot
 	
 	
 		can't call them the New Orleans Saints any more
 	
 	
 		i don't think so
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		we went to the play-offs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i'm a i'm a Buffalo Bills fan
 	
 	
 		yeah now i like them too
 	
 	
 		from a
 		from a long time ago so it's good to it's good to see the Bills doing so well now and
 	
 	
 		they are they are doing a whole bunch better who's their quarterback
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		who's their quarterback
 	
 	
 		uh Jim Kelly
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i like to watch them too they're the i like to watch almost all the football but um of course i watch every Saints game that i can watch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i think they're going to i think they're really going to do good because it seems like they're finally all coming together
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if they would just quit blowing it
 	
 	
 		well the it the the NFL draft really seems to be doing its job because got teams like
 		like Buffalo who weren't certainly weren't a powerhouse uh ten years ago now they've been able to get some good players and come around and the New Orleans the same story and uh
 		and uh a few years ago Denver was a powerhouse and then they uh
 		they weren't getting the draft picks and now the uh other team so it seems to be uh moving around and uh to to New Orleans benefit and uh you see how look at the Cowboys now they're uh they're hurting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		really bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they got so much bad publicity too and i think that hurt a lot of you know people even wanting to play on their team
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah well well well yeah uh firing firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson what what kind of uh uh
 		doesn't give you much respect for their team at all any team any team that that where the owner would fire Tom Landry you know is like one of the greatest coaches of all time
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and just because they had had a couple of bad seasons and you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah because all the problems i mean if you think about those years that we had the losing season of how bad i mean his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs because of uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know messing with young children and i mean it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other
 	
 	
 		right and he always and uh had a lot of trouble with injuries too
 	
 	
 		with them
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know he'd uh never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy and then even like uh what is it Eric Dickerson left the team you know that you're right you know like people were jumping ship right and left
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i don't know that sounds to to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem but then the team was sold
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		but uh that Jimmy Johnson came in too though and he just you know when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided you know this is the way it's going to be and it was bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean it really was to me it was like it's going to take them quite a while to rebuild because everything everything i mean anything that Tom Landry wanted or had he was going to change it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean it's that i mean you know that's the way i felt about it but i tell you what if New Orleans ever gets a quarterback ain't nobody going to beat us
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in fact nobody going to beat us then because look how good we did without a quarterback this year
 	
 	
 		i know who was the quarterback see i can't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback is
 	
 	
 		well
 		they had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it uh Arcade was for a while
 		and then um i can't remember that guy's name the one that held out for the money and he was across the river
 		uh i can't think of the i can't think of his name now but really we didn't have a quarterback that was the whole problem we had one guy that couldn't throw and we had one guy that couldn't run
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it was it was just bedlam we really didn't have a quarterback it was uh defense winning winning winning all the games
 	
 	
 		did they were they able to draft anybody this year
 	
 	
 		i don't know because you know they gave away a lot of their drafts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for different people for you know other places
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i don't know i hadn't heard you know whether they have a new one or not
 	
 	
 		well when is the NFL draft hasn't has the NFL draft even gone yet
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		huh-uh not yet but i mean i don't know whether they have one of the first you know choices of somebody that would be real good
 	
 	
 		right
 		right well they've yeah they've
 	
 	
 		i mean yeah everybody gets in draft
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but i don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		or even making the play-offs so that doesn't doesn't help you in the draft
 	
 	
 		right but we really i mean really and truly we just don't have a quarterback
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's all there is to it but the players and stuff they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too because we had some you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that was a few years ago
 	
 	
 		yeah well he was good but we every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and of course we had a different coach then too but they'd treat him bad and then he'd leave
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or either they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it was weird it was like they were trying if you were good boy let's don't have you on our team you know but um this year they had all good players except for the quarterback
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the quarterback all of them every one that they played i think they played uh i can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks but all of them were bad i mean they were terrible they could not pitch you know they couldn't even take hand-offs it was terrible
 	
 	
 		hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um all the other places i mean our defense was unbelievable
 	
 	
 		oh that's one
 		it's one thing
 		yeah Buffalo's lucky though to have uh Jim Kelly then now he's the number one rated quarterback in the NFL i think i'm pretty sure he was this past season and uh
 	
 	
 		did you get to watch any of their games
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		then with uh
 		uh the defense with Bruce Smith Bruce Smith there at linebacker there they've got a very well rounded team and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as they problems they had in the past and now they're uh
 		really playing as a good good together as a team
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		um do you watch it every Sunday
 	
 	
 		uh
 		when i can i'm a i'm a musician and uh the band i play in uh i this is just something on the side and uh the band i play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays so i missed a lot of Sundays during
 	
 	
 		um did you ever get to watch any of the uh New Orleans games
 	
 	
 		this
 		actually i i'd have to confess i don't really scope out the New Orleans games per say
 		New Orleans just isn't isn't one of the areas i've lived in so many places i've lived in uh
 	
 	
 		i'm a
 	
 	
 		Denver but i don't like the Broncos there's
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		no love for the Broncos but i've lived in uh
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh i was born in Buffalo and i lived in uh outside of Boston for five years and then my family lives in Philadelphia now and uh so i tend to look for uh
 		uh and i lived in Detroit too so i like uh first of all first and foremost the Bills games i want to see and then i'll uh normally check out the Eagles or the Patriots and Patriots were so depressing this last year that
 	
 	
 		teams in your area
 		i know it
 	
 	
 		yeah that uh i kind of gave up on them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		first and foremost the Bills i even went i went to got to go to a Bills game this year which was fun it was the the Bills Eagles game which appropriately enough
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 	
 	
 		fortunately the Bills won
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was good weather
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		we beat Buffalo in in and
 		was it third of December
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and it was sunny and forty five degrees so we couldn't have done much better than that in Buffalo
 	
 	
 		no because usually it's snowing  ice and rain and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but i tell you what if you get to watch some of these now i don't know how it will be this year you know but i mean these games go right down to the wire
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair you know going oh no no and one uh i can't remember it was about uh it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the play-offs or not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we're watching the game all right the other team got the ball and we had like no we got the ball back that's the way it was and they had to kick
 		and uh to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we had to sit there you know and they cut the show off and showing started showing us another football game
 		we did not get to see the end of the game you talk about people calling in it was wild i mean here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair you know and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another you know one that was going on
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		sure and then they changed the game
 		right
 	
 	
 		cut us off right there the last few seconds the station finally you know how they'll put the little message down at the bottom started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had cut that off that it was the national you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		right it was the network
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and because it was funny i mean everybody was furious i was so mad i got up and went and called  you know i couldn't believe that but
 		almost every game that i watched it would come right down to the end we would be ahead you know but then at the very in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with them or you know right ahead of them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it'd come right down to the end and either we made it or we didn't oh and it was it was something else i said this is the most if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's no question about it because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks and the quarterbacks just didn't do anything
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's the that's the guy that counts
 	
 	
 		yes but maybe we maybe we'll get your guy
 	
 	
 		well i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time
