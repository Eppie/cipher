 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well good afternoon to you Mary first let me ask you what's what's the weather like up there to begin with
 	
 	
 		and good
 		well well today uh when i got up it was twenty nine degrees
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yes and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon but it's been cloudy overcast and threatening rain all day
 	
 	
 		that sounds more like our winter weather down here
 	
 	
 		and we've also had extremely strong winds fifteen to twenty miles an hour for the day
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you know i bet that's what we that storm we had last night
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh we had a frog strangler go sweeping sweeping through here uh yesterday and last night and we're expecting another one tonight
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		oh i mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street
 	
 	
 		we had one of those two days ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but not uh but uh no rain at all yesterday and uh no rain today
 	
 	
 		well it's probably on its way up there it was heading north
 	
 	
 		thanks a lot  could couldn't you send us some nice weather
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it was nice today
 	
 	
 		oh was it
 	
 	
 		uh in between the thunder showers yes
 	
 	
 		well the one thing's for sure we can always discuss the weather how some ever we can't do very much to change it
 	
 	
 		well you know what they say about the weather here in Texas
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		if you if you don't like it wait five minutes it'll change
 	
 	
 		oh yes well that's about the way our weather is here also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what
 	
 	
 		and i grew up in Saint Louis and Saint Louis was much the same
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well tell me uh is is it normally that cold up there in the in the Spring
 	
 	
 		no it's not this is uh about uh ten degrees cooler than usual but about a week ago we were up to eighty and eighty five degrees
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		no no it uh it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems
 	
 	
 		you are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open
 	
 	
 		i'm sure i didn't i was ready to turn on the air conditioning
 		it no it really was extremely warm it only got down to about sixty five in the evening
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we had about three or four days of that and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and uh temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time
 		and uh it has gone down gradually each day this morning it was twenty nine yesterday it was about thirty two uh cars were scraping ice off their cars this morning if they've been sitting out all night
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it really wasn't too wasn't too pleasant
 	
 	
 		oh mother macree
 		no i should say not
 		well i i sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had
 	
 	
 		oh i hope not
 	
 	
 		i hope it doesn't reach you up there
 	
 	
 		well they are predicting rain and thunderstorms and i wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had
 	
 	
 		well i let's hope it well it if it's the same as what we had at least it'll be warmer
 	
 	
 		uh yeah  yes warm rain well of course by the time it gets up here it may run run into a cold front coming down from Canada
 	
 	
 		yeah oh boy the the that whew that would be tear disastrous if you had that rain storm and freezing weather
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we had uh a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the uh of the city of Dayton itself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour
 		it was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning
 		it it wasn't uh it wasn't conditions to being out in it and i had just gotten home we had a lot of tornado warnings also
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and i had gotten home shortly before that uh the rain started so uh i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well uh i heard on the news this morning that um
 		one of our local schools uh lost the roof of their gymnasium
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and they suspected may have been a tornado
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh uh thank God for small favors the uh
 		uh what do they call them the the
 		marching band or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh uh had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before
 	
 	
 		oh they that was
 		very very fortunate for them
 		because that could have really been disastrous
 	
 	
 		oh and how
 	
 	
 		well of course this is tornado season uh in to uh we have many tornadoes spawned in this area and northern Indiana now we're in the southwestern part of uh Ohio
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just forty miles north due north of Cincinnati and uh but uh northern Indiana has many tornadoes come roaring across and we get the backlash off of it if not the part of the tornado itself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh we you know we get a lot of bad weather in this area
 		but of course you're supposed to be the sun belt and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well during the winter yes we do uh we've had uh
 		well past four or five years i guess at least one day
 		during the year when just everything would just close down because we'd have freezing rain
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh of course people down here they just don't know how to handle themselves and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right yes i was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed
 	
 	
 		oh not only that but we're we're either either don't have the equipment to handle it either
 	
 	
 		to uh having to drive in it
 		right right
 		and
 	
 	
 		uh they go out there and the well all you can do with with uh freezing rain of course is spread sand on the ice
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and but uh you know we don't even have vehicles that will do that they they have to get uh a truck of sand and uh uh four or five laborers up there just spreading it by hand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right well uh well here what they do and i i contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt
 		and of course the salt does melt the ice but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes uh a perpetual problem
 	
 	
 		well and then to make matters worse it destroys your vehicles too
 	
 	
 		oh it sure does do that
 	
 	
 		yeah they well we they do that down here too they mix the salt in with the sand
 	
 	
 		well sand and uh but i have learned to do is uh now that i am alone is uh to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car um
 		not only in case i need it for that for traction but for additional weight in the back of the car and then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of that but
 	
 	
 		i've no i'm a dog lover myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well the dogs don't use litter but kitty litter is excellent for uh getting under the wheels of cars and what have you and giving you traction uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i guess it would be
 	
 	
 		yeah it uh works out uh really quite well course i have i have a dog also my son brought me a little Lhasa Apso uh for my birthday last Thanksgiving he brought him from Dallas he
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh wasn't that nice of him
 	
 	
 		yes that uh he just thought i had been without a dog uh for three years that was long enough
 	
 	
 		uh i have uh a a chowperd myself
 	
 	
 		he he had
 		oh a what
 	
 	
 		a chowperd
 	
 	
 		now that one i'm not familiar with
 	
 	
 		well she's part Chow and part shepherd
 	
 	
 		uh okay okay that makes sense then  i believe
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but she's the best
 		the best of both breeds
 	
 	
 		yes right well i've always had big dogs before never had a little dog before and
 	
 	
 		well June is medium sized but she is scared to death of thunder storms
 	
 	
 		yes well
 		oh well i had a German short hair that was frightened of storms the minute it would begin to storm he would just panic
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i had to put him down when he was fourteen and two months later i had to put my yellow Lab down because he had leukemia
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh  then uh then there was no point in having all my acreage i had four and a half acres with game preserve on three sides
 	
 	
 		oh that must be nice
 	
 	
 		oh well it was great i loved it but then i didn't need all that anymore so i finally sold that and i'm in a fair size condo and i have a nice size patio
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so this little dog has plenty of room to run
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		yeah and he is a a cutie and uh but i've never had a dog i had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either and it's
 	
 	
 		no well now you know it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in Miami Beach somewhere
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or better yet down around Saint Petersburg Florida
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's what i call home
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		i lived there for ten years
 	
 	
 		oh well i was there once way way back in nineteen sixty i think for just a week's vacation
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i that's about the only time i've been to Florida except passing through on the way to someplace else
 	
 	
 		yep well i lived there in the seventies
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i i love it i have two sons still living down there
 	
 	
 		um-hum well uh uh most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in Florida but uh i have just that's just not been my thing we used to always head west or head north
 		now that i'm alone why uh i uh prefer to travel overseas if i'm going anywhere
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		course there too you never know what the weather's going to be when you start getting over to
 	
 	
 		well that's that's why i was suggesting uh that Saint Petersburg is got got to be the finest weather in the world
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		oh i i loved it down there
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		course you could tell always tell which were the the natives natives
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and which ones were the snowbirds
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah the snowbirds were the
