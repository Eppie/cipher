 
     		
 	
 		so that the topic is hobbies
 	
 	
 		in your spare time
 	
 	
 		yeah  who has spare time um i don't really don't really do any handicraft things like that i used to i used to do like salt dough ornaments and things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but that was oh good many many years ago and i have i really my spare time i usually go do aerobics and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		read and that's about it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i understand that i'm you know i work full time and i have two kids so
 		my spare time usually  involves something with the kids yeah you know hobbies we i i can't really say that we have hobbies it's more like maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		projects or something on the weekend you know we like to go out
 		go out
 	
 	
 		yeah family well well that's what i meant by salt that we we did that like as a family little ornaments and things like that and just kind of really got into it like during the Christmas season making them up for other people and things like that but
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		as far as i've just never been very skilled at far you know needle work wise and the things i've tried to do just don't look very good and
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 		i've i guess mostly as far as as crafts go i've done um some needlepoint and i've done mostly cross stitching i used to uh do like um
 		one that i did for both kids are like
 		oh they're plaques with you know different kind of animals and then you have their birth date on them and then you have a little picture of them and you frame them and stuff but nothing steady just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when i get some spare time here and there i'll work on it but you know it's nothing that i can really
 	
 	
 		it's not like you sit and knit every night yeah i don't even know how to knit and my mother used to knit you know all the time and and i don't even know how to knit and i'm like that's a lost art from this family
 	
 	
 		no not at all
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um but it's not a very good topic it feels like if you know not when you're neither neither one of us are really
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		i i have seen things i really like you know that were done
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		especially like needlepoint needlepoint cushions and things but it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it you know that and that the petty point and things like that it's like God it just just seems like it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		easier just to go out and buy it already made
 	
 	
 		i don't know what  what what is it's like there but here a lot of the country stuff is in you know lot of the woodwork a lot of uh stenciling
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know you can go to any like a flea market and stuff and there's just tons of stuff everywhere and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know people just do it in their garage and then on weekends they go out and sell it and during the week they go back and do some more
 	
 	
 		and see they do that as their job whereas you know for us it and they make it cheaper for us to buy so
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		but and i i mean i'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that because i can remember when i used to do you know those little salt dough figurines and things it was it was relaxing you know creative you felt very creative
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it just was so time time involved you know so much time involved and the different steps and things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so and
 	
 	
 		okay well i think i think we're okay i think we did done five minutes so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore okay well thank you
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 		okay i hope you have a good rest of your weekend okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		thanks bye-bye
