 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um so do you have a personal computer
 	
 	
 		uh well we do have one in in our home uh it's on the fritz right now because the monitor isn't working properly but
 		uh it has been uh used tremendously mostly by my children for uh playing games
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		however
 		um you know the bane of our existence these days uh but it does have a word processing program which all of us have used for reports reports and papers and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what when this subject was mentioned to us i said well i went gee that's all i use mine for is a word processor and i haven't used it since i got out of college and that was six years ago
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		but it it was my sister's who my sister bought it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh my father had a small business and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business and he never did he always did everything out by hand he only had three employees so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it wasn't really worth it to him to do to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah actually it would be worth it if he were able to get a program that would do something that he normally had to do by hand
 	
 	
 		yeah like pay the payroll and yeah basically payroll
 	
 	
 		exactly and there are lots of them on the market
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you do have to research that find out what works for your system what kind do you have
 	
 	
 		um it's an IBM i think it's a Professional Three Hundred no that's that's the digital one it's an uh IBM PC Junior i think
 	
 	
 		oh well that's a nice computer
 	
 	
 		yeah she she uh she uses it now uh my sister to actually she moved and my father wasn't using it she  took it with he
 	
 	
 		uh-huh so she took it with her
 		yeah don't blame her
 	
 	
 		
 
 		because she needed it to do she just finished up her Bachelor's degree so i don't know if she's going to even use it anymore it it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah oh well well encourage her to try other things because um i am uh i work in a school system and i teach writing and we use the computers a great deal for word processing
 		uh you know because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer as you probably found out yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um i also am sponsoring a literary magazine and we're doing our entire layout on the computer
 		uh because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have a publishing program
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's that's neat that's a very good use
 	
 	
 		so it is wonderful once you get into some of the programs that are out now you can do so much with them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that you don't do until you really make yourself use them
 	
 	
 		well i know there there's got to be a lot of uses but it's just you you have to have a need
 	
 	
 		you have to make yourself do it yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but you have to have a need i really have no need for it at all um i work for Digital Equipment and we have a powerful computer down at work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		oh  so you don't need a personal one
 	
 	
 		no and i i still really don't do that much as you say play games on it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		they're great for playing games my brother
 	
 	
 		right well my son is uh studying electronic technology and he's been able to do things on uh on the personal computer here that really have enhanced his um reports and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um and i guess it if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful but  um unless it is i guess it's kind of a waste
 	
 	
 		i know some people who just they just went through a course uh and took the electronic grafting course
 	
 	
 		oh that's fascinating uh-huh
 	
 	
 		drafting not grafting  but drafting course the CAD
 	
 	
 		yeah i knew what you meant yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's really neat i mean yeah you can do graphs graphs on it too but this is you know this is one step above it but it's actual um drafting and i always
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes you can do wonderful design it it's really  well especially when anyone who's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering  uh drawing drawing um you have to be so precise
 	
 	
 		yeah and the computer does it all for you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it was really neat i wanted to go to that course but my boss wouldn't pay for it i'm like i'll get a job some day and my boss will pay for it i'll be needed
 	
 	
 		oh well
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because um i i i didn't want to go do it myself because i didn't think i was really going to use it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i got this cough i've got a cold because it was eighty degrees up here and i went outside with no coat on
 	
 	
 		oh boy  what a change huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it was bad
 		yes it was a big change
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you couldn't really wear a coat because it was so hot and then again i picked up a cold
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
  
 		but i'm doing all right getting over it
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		so i don't i don't even know how much um personal computers cost nowadays
 	
 	
 		well they vary tremendously
 		um because you can get because you're they're uh the ones that were made a few years ago  uh have come down in price significantly
 		um you can get them i've seen them for five and six hundred dollars but they're much less  um have much less memory and capable of much less
 	
 	
 		yeah they can't do your um your drafting and your graphs and all of that
 	
 	
 		no you can't do very much on them
 		right right um well it's just that you have to have uh you have to be able to get your program in and and many many of the programs are so big
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh they take up so much space that you don't have any place then to work you don't have any bytes left but um if you um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if if you want to go into one that's really useful you're going to have to go over a thousand dollars and even for a personal computer it's probably smart to spend that much
 		and and we've ours is not quite that powerful and so you know we are we are limited which may be one reason why
 	
 	
 		you do run into you do run into limitations on yours oh wow
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh some things we can't do but but then we haven't needed to either you know um but we've been able to do what we can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow that's neat that you even you even reach the limits of yours i haven't even begun to reach the limits of  it i've
 	
 	
 		no but i mine is not as good as a PC uh
 	
 	
 		yeah junior yeah
 	
 	
 		uh Junior yeah yeah ours is a Commodore 128
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it it's not quite as um as useful not quite as powerful
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		they say that Commodore has made a good um PC for the price though
 	
 	
 		they did yeah that's very true that's very true they did
 	
 	
 		very competitive i don't even i don't even know much money my sister spent on hers but i i just thought i it's it's going to be a waste she's not going to do it not going to use it
 	
 	
 		sounds like he that you were right
 	
 	
 		oh well
 		yeah well she likes it she gets to write her reports but like i say she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wan ted
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and she could have bought a typewriter also
 	
 	
 		yeah a typewriter with memory would would have been fine it's all she ever uses it for
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think it might have a spelling editor on it i'm not sure
 		um
 	
 	
 		yeah it yeah it probably if she if it doesn't she could easily put it on
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's one of the one great thing about it
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		right which program did you use did you use Word Perfect
 	
 	
 		um no i i really don't it's it was six years ago she pretty much set it up she goes here this is you make your file and then you can uh edit it right
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i used the one the one at work a lot um matter of fact anything i've had to write from now on i had to  God forbid write a couple of resumes and i was just great and all you have to do is just put it in a uh
 		the spelling check mode and  i don't even have to look my my words up anymore
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah they're great you're right well i guess we've spent our time i need to go help my daughter do something so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay good
 	
 	
 		this has been fun talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay yeah well bye
 	
 	
 		good luck
 		uh bye-bye
