 
     		
 	
 		okay when is the last time i saw a movie
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i don't know it hasn't really been that long but my my uh the last movie i saw was on TV uh and i was trying to remember it was called Back Stab
 		and it was uh
 		it was really intriguing and i found i i i have a i have a problem with i just about forget them once i've seen them
 		but i guess the really the one that i really saw that i really liked was Ghost did you see that
 	
 	
 		the Ghost yes yeah i saw it on campus that's very good yep uh
 	
 	
 		Ghost
 		with um
 		um
 	
 	
 		um right Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg
 	
 	
 		Demi Moore and and uh
 		and the guy who did did the
 	
 	
 		right i don't remember his name um
 	
 	
 		the dancing the dirty uh i'll think of it in a minute yeah he was it was really good i just thought that was great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah i thought that it made you think about um
 		you know what happens when you die and everything and is are there really angels and ghost and things and so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um it almost makes you kind of think about things it gives you a different way of thinking them because you you're you're in you you know that you always wonder and when you see something like that that kind of well hey well maybe it could be that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right maybe it's really maybe i should take life more seriously and  and be a little bit more careful but uh yep um
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
 
 		i know
 	
 	
 		so let's see what else have i seen i saw
 	
 	
 		how about how about i guess we could talk about TV movies i mean i don't know that they're really really truly movies i mean
