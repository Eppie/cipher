 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		so do you fish
 	
 	
 		oh yeah my dad has a lake cabin and so we go there for the small lake uh
 		just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area it takes us about three hours to get there and we go and we fish and we catch a bunch of junk  nothing nothing to talk about for the most part but it's fun
 	
 	
 		uh from a boat or from shore
 	
 	
 		from the dock from shore
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice uh
 		mostly catfish or
 	
 	
 		oh mostly we catch carp if we're doing good we catch a catfish or two once in a while and you know we go ahead and eat those but we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry what we normally do is just uh go ahead and clean it up and then uh
 		you know put it in a bag and freeze it and and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd usually there's a pretty good crowd there so we don't ever catch enough to eat carp is usually pretty much fun
 		because i've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little you know a little pole with twenty pound test line and that that's a pretty good fight so that's a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah a real light line real light rig well that sounds like fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they fight hard
 	
 	
 		fish in Colorado so different than that mostly trout
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in the mountains
 	
 	
 		yeah and in the rivers and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah mountain streams and rivers
 	
 	
 		are they good to eat
 	
 	
 		uh yeah very yeah there isn't much there you know
 	
 	
 		oh you mean size wise they're not very big
 	
 	
 		um by and large no but but they're big fun
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've been is that mostly uh fly fishing when you're doing that or are you fly fishing or are you using a bobber
 	
 	
 		what
 		i i i'm a fly fisherman
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i cast a ways i'm not highly proficient but it's fun
 	
 	
 		i've never even tried that my if i don't have a reel with a button on it i tend to get so much backlash it's not worth the trouble
 	
 	
 		well let me explain fly fly fishing to you then you're not casting a weight on the end of the line
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you're casting the weight of the line
 	
 	
 		with the little thing on the end yeah i thought it had a weight
 	
 	
 		yeah well the fly on the end weighs nothing it weighs less than the line
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so what you do is you strip off oh four five six little rolls
 		coils of line into your hand
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you whip the line
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		as you whip it
 		over your head or side to side
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you slowly feed out more and more
 	
 	
 		hum
 		so you're fishing downstream so it will carry some
 	
 	
 		well no no you fish upstream
 	
 	
 		oh you fish upstream
 	
 	
 		right and then you let it carry it downstream
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then you reel it in and you do it again
 	
 	
 		you hope that they think it's a bug and
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly jump at it
 	
 	
 		and eat it yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		from what i'm seeing and hearing and all the the big pattern that's
 		really
 		looking forward for spring is the grub pattern
 	
 	
 		that's a fish
 	
 	
 		no no it it looks like a grub yeah okay whenever you yeah a lure a fly
 	
 	
 		oh it's a it's a lure
 		i see
 	
 	
 		whenever
 		you have a something that looks like something else
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's a fly you call it a pattern
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		all right uh you know there's bumble bee patterns
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's excuse me uh there's bumble patterns there's mosquito patterns there's wasp patterns there's grub patterns uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		did someone just come up with this design and and you're going to make one for yourself or are you going to buy it
 	
 	
 		uh you can buy them uh i've got some and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall
 	
 	
 		oh it's just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you know how that changes
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		the phase of the moon and
 	
 	
 		i guess so we tend to use just bait and a few lures but bait tends to work the best just some blood bait
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i i
 		yeah i'm from west Texas
 	
 	
 		oh are you where are you from oh i'm from Midland
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		Lubbock
 		oh another west Texan
 	
 	
 		i went to college at Tech so you've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i've been up there
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		i didn't catch anything but i've been up there
 	
 	
 		it
 		it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day
 	
 	
 		yeah it's fun it's lazy take a picnic lunch i used to do that with my dad every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day before it got too hot
 	
 	
 		yeah it's
 		well
 		there you fish mornings and evenings
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah we do most of our fishing at night
 	
 	
 		and nights
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just from the heat of it all that's one advantage you've certainly got on us
 	
 	
 		it at times gets incredibly hot here
 	
 	
 		it does i've only been up there once in the summer well no i've been up there twice in the summer but both times it was really pleasant in fact it snowed on us in in
 		gosh when was that we were in Mesa Verde Park and it was like the end of June it was just before July fourth
 	
 	
 		June
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it was twenty eight twenty nine degrees we were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags not knowing any better  and here it went and it froze and it snowed on us
 		we did not know what to do about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		fishing is not just just dragging fish out of the water it's it's a total experience you know getting out in nature and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hearing the crickets and listening to the birds and seeing the squirrels and camping out and eating out of doors and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you
 		yeah
 		do you have to do you wear waders when you fish
 	
 	
 		uh i probably ought to i just freeze
 	
 	
 		oh goodness it must be a little bit cold
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well you know ankle deep or standing on the bank and slipping it out there
 	
 	
 		that's cold water around there
 	
 	
 		slipping it out there
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know i always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it out there and
 	
 	
 		do you have any
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		you know how it is the water's kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah and you get you get a little more carried away with it and you move a little closer
 	
 	
 		and then you're in to it just a little bit and then you splash in and the next thing you know your knees are wet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you have any kids that you take fishing
 	
 	
 		uh
 		got a stepdaughter she's real sweet and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		at times she enjoys it at times not and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a fuzzy little dog
 	
 	
 		i have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old and the little one of course is could care less the uh three and a half year old has just gotten to the point we got him a little pole last year and just put uh
 	
 	
 		ah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up  that was what he considered fishing  this year he's gotten to where he can we we were at a friend's uh stock pond we were out at their farm
 		and and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we walked we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish and he started trying to cast it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so he he was kind of getting there but he's
 	
 	
 		yeah you guys sure want to be out of range
 	
 	
 		he's at a dangerous point right now he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in
 	
 	
 		it takes time yeah last year we had a oh just a wonderful trip up to Trappers Lake oh it was cold and rain the whole time and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we still had a good time out of the deal
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's good
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and Colorado is a beautiful place to live
 	
 	
 		oh yeah my husband would like to live there but i don't know all of our family is here so
 	
 	
 		well and you've got to have you've got to work for a living to
 	
 	
 		well yeah but TI is up there so  that part of it would probably work out
 	
 	
 		what division y'all in
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry what
 	
 	
 		what division are y'all in
 	
 	
 		we're both uh i was uh military but he's division three
 		it goes back and forth Division well maybe division one right now he's in computers
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so and he's in school and everything else i have some friends who work up there
 	
 	
 		well the only thing up here is division one
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		Kathy and Kevin Guy
 	
 	
 		okay yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and they like to fish they've been inviting us to come up there in the summer her dad has a cabin and they go fishing up there
 	
 	
 		oh fishing's fishing is fun up here it's not
 	
 	
 		so that would be neat to try it some time
 	
 	
 		it seems like the success ratio the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there but
 		it is fun you know it
 	
 	
 		yeah long as you have a good time that's the main point so
 	
 	
 		the the experience is is better up here i think you know it seems more relaxing there's more to look at
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		definitely more to look at
 	
 	
 		and and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if you're if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake
 	
 	
 		yeah the only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up we camped next to one one time when we were there a couple of summers ago
 		and we figured we were up a long way off and then it rained that night and we thought well wonder how far off we are and we got up the next day and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about
 		three feet away and it's like oh well maybe we ought to move just a touch so that was kind of funny
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden
 	
 	
 		yeah i just love the way it looks i could almost just watch the water we in fact we have gotten out on on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much and if you were there i mean it was
 		one time we were there and i guess it was late May so it was really your spring almost you know at even though it was it was really summer down here and and the i guess the creek the mountains were really starting to melt and the creek was just wild just running
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and all the white water and noise and the it was just beautiful
 	
 	
 		yeah it it gets foamy foamy almost and you know it's just pure and pristine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the froth and
