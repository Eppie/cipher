 		and it was bothering my knees that spring and we have lots of wind in Indiana and i thought oh shoot i'll just walk to town
 		and i guess that probably started me on a career because i walk a lot in fact it's a part of my life every day i
 		walk at least two miles uh
 		as a side effect i noticed that i was firming up so i thought well gosh maybe if i diet you know this might be
 		work out real well so i ended up losing about thirty five pounds that spring and summer and i had not thought of myself as a fat person and people would say to me gosh i didn't you know
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		you're really skinny where'd this weight go well evidently i had some weight that i could afford to lose because i'm certainly not skinny now but i guess everything just shook into place so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		walking uh is very much a part of my life and since my husband's retirement he
 		has also started walking with me
 		and i guess i'd have to say it's a part of both of our lives and we just recommend it to anyone who'll listen to us
 	
 	
 		oh i don't blame you walking is uh you know it's interesting because i think we went through a a phase there where it was jogging
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		everybody should jog you should get out you should jog and then i started hearing about well i'm not able to jog because i'm i have asthma and um
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but i did like to walk and my neighbor and i get out we'd walk and walk and uh unfortunately we haven't done it well i've been in class until it's like seven thirty at night and she having is having a flare up of arthritis and we haven't done it for in about a month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now and oh gosh do i notice a difference
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i was at the point where if i hadn't gotten my walk in i was a real grouch that day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh a friend gave me this Prevention walking magazine a year ago at Christmas time and they recommend that you only walk five times a week that you do not walk every day but for me the days that i don't i'm not much fun to be around
 	
 	
 		oh neat
 		right
 		
 
 		well you know now walking relieves a lot of tension and it's a good way to work off vent frustration and things like this i i can't i think
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh uh it depends on how far you walk how many days a week
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know if you if you're walking ten miles  you know seven days a week maybe that uh has some effect but uh i think if you're not walking how many just out of curiosity how many miles do you usually walk
 	
 	
 		at least two
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you see now that's what i do and um but that that's just about enough and uh uh i mean not that i wouldn't like to walk more but uh um i've
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i am a widow so uh and i have a handicapped son so i have to really set my priorities of what you know but this is one thing that i do enjoy very much doing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so but you know i have tried aerobics and i have trouble with that uh
 	
 	
 		ah
 		i jig when they jog
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i i can't
 	
 	
 		i just can't keep and uh the jogging was never for me because my knees are not i just don't think they could stand that so
 	
 	
 		no
 		right well i i have trouble
 		right well i have trouble with one too in fact sometimes if i even just twist wrong my kneecap will pop off so you know um walking seems to be the one and it it really seems to be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		the most beneficial all the way around it gets your circulation going good it uh uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um it seems to have so many other benefits you know besides just the exercise
 	
 	
 		um uh
 		we're golfers also uh have you done that
 	
 	
 		well uh no my when my husband was living he tried to get he loved to golf he was the avid golfer i used to go with him but only to uh uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		be caddy because um i have a very severe perceptual problem and uh i tried it a few time but uh i can't get you you have to make it down to the hole
 	
 	
 		um
 		yes
 	
 	
 		in in six or seven times you know and when it get more than that and uh so i just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it went out for the walk with him and enjoyed you know uh pushing the cart or pulling it or whatever you know  but that is that's great my stepfather is seventy four and he goes golfing every day
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 		i think that's the beauty of the game that we it's it's a sport that we can participate in as we sink into the sunset so to speak and of course here in Indiana the weather limits us
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		quite a bit our golf season will start and then stop due to weather and then start we had a
 	
 	
 		right sure
 	
 	
 		last weekend it was just absolutely beautiful and this weekend it's cold and rainy so so we're pretty limited and i guess maybe that might be the one reason that we would be forced into going
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		uh south for part of the winter
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh our children live here and our home will always be here but
 	
 	
 		right i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		for better weather we might consider that next winter i'm not
 	
 	
 		well you know it's interesting what they've been what they have what has really caught on here is mall walking
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yes yes yes yes
 	
 	
 		now that has been something i think is really neat the mall actually opens an hour and a half earlier than the stores
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it so that people can come in in the winter time and walk
 	
 	
 		and it's so interesting because we made an extended drive as far west as San Diego which i guess is as far west as you can go and down into Texas and then through Colorado on the way home
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and we went to the malls to walk a lot and that's a brotherhood out there those people are you know gosh if Sophie wasn't here today let's go find her and they're really
 		they know who's supposed to be there and what time they're supposed to come and when they're through walking they stopped for coffee and it's it's really neat it's
 	
 	
 		that is neat you know i like that
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really neat i and i even as an outsider passing through town you know after three laps around the exterior of this mall they pretty well know you so  it's it's a fun thing to do
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's right
 		yes yes i think so
 	
 	
 		well i i must get back to work nice chatting with you
 	
 	
 		okay it was nice chatting with you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
