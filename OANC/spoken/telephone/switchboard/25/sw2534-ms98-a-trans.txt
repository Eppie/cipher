 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what kind of neat hobbies do you have
 	
 	
 		well i like gardening a lot i like to be outside um
 	
 	
 		i like gardening i wish i had a green thumb though
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've got a brown thumb that's what everything turns
 	
 	
 		uh oh  is but do you try keep trying anyway
 	
 	
 		i keep trying uh you know you just can't can't give up on it uh i uh i bought some uh plants from Michigan Bulb Company  they send them to you all ready alive
 	
 	
 		no no i've never had any luck with their's
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i guess i guess these are going to croak too since i've got cats i decided to get some catnip
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		lots and lots of catnip so it's it's still green and it's been two days so i'm encouraged
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no i i haven't had had good luck with that company uh i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail probably
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've had to to get my money back from them and had better luck with with some of the the more expensive companies
 	
 	
 		yeah there's a uh i don't know do you have Lowe's up there
 	
 	
 		because they
 		uh well
 	
 	
 		its uh building uh contractor or building supplies place
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		um they they also have a garden shop and they they offer just as good a guarantee if you buy it from them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's great now our local stores don't don't offer any guarantee
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		but some of the the mail order ones that i've dealt with for roses and that they offer through through the first Summer
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which at least if they if they take off the first year they're probably going to come up unless there's uh a terrible freeze or something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah something like that uh i got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff so i'm going to wait on those
 	
 	
 		oh they're bulbs for Spring or Fall
 	
 	
 		uh probably Spring but uh i don't much care about things like that i'll i'll make a little sort of greenhouse a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		something something to keep me occupied you see
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'll uh buy some plastic and make a little house and
 	
 	
 		cute
 	
 	
 		yeah and watch the cats tear it up
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right i don't know that do cats bother bulbs i think more the mice or other rodents
 	
 	
 		they they just like to get in and dig
 	
 	
 		oh i see so if you have fresh dirt they'll
 	
 	
 		oh they love to dig i had i had some uh i don't know what kind they are i've already forgotten just regular old flower seeds
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i planted them and i was so i was so thrilled because they came up i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place and then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that
 	
 	
 		uh gee
 	
 	
 		so i have to hang these things high so they can't get to them especially the catnip
 	
 	
 		how many cats do you have oh okay

 	
 	
 		three
 		
 
 	
 	
 		actually i just put a uh little fence around my yard uh um
 		which is i suppose technically illegal but i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they'll let me get by with it and it it's got this one inch mesh and what i've noticed it's kept the cats out and i love it
 	
 	
 		um yeah yeah because they they like to get in and fertilize things too but uh why would it be illegal
 	
 	
 		well because we have these town uh i live in a townhouse and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh yeah right
 	
 	
 		and you know they want uh privacy fences
 	
 	
 		well if nobody yeah if nobody complains you're all right
 	
 	
 		right right well they do walking tours too so
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but at least because i back up to um a hillside where the uh wild animals are i think i can probably justify it
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah an and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway
 	
 	
 		right right i mean
 	
 	
 		you know you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right the first year the deer ate my garden and i was just astounded i'm going deer right here in the city
 	
 	
 		yeah right here Bambi
 	
 	
 		
 
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		uh gosh
 	
 	
 		and so
 	
 	
 		well let's see other than gardening which i fiddle at i'm not very good at what else do i mostly just computer stuff
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that uh cooking that's not really a hobby it's a necessity but but i enjoy it i like to think that i'm a very good cook
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		hobbies that's about it i don't have much time for hobbies so uh
 		between being a student and trying to run a business on the side you don't have a lot of time
 	
 	
 		right that keeps you busy
 	
 	
 		yeah and raising cats
 	
 	
 		i mean that could become a hobby
 	
 	
 		well it's it started out as a hobby actually uh it just it developed into sort of a business uh you know we breed them and all that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		but we didn't you know we didn't really start it for the money it was just they were fun to have around and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds and
 		and now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them and you know all this kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh what kind of cats are they
 	
 	
 		uh i've got a uh a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		yeah the himmy is probably the sweetest one she's she's just a little sweetheart
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we uh the the Bombay had a litter uh last October and i just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed only going to breed them once
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh she's not she's not feeling too great today
 	
 	
 		um is that typical to only breed them once
 	
 	
 		no uh most most breeders are in it for the money so they'll breed they'll breed them twice a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i i just think that it's kind of i do n't know it's kind of cruel you know they just they just breed these they breed them before they're ready uh and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you're never you're never real and and they they do a lot of inbreeding too and so you end up with you know kind of strange kittens
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i just don't like that
 	
 	
 		so will you uh breed one of the litter then next year
 	
 	
 		we're we sold all that litter
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um
 		we there's not that much call to for Bombay's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um they're they're registered but they're not they're not uh they're not show cats
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		uh so all you can do is sell them as pet quality
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh so what you've got is a registered pet and not too many people want Bombay's they want things like himmy Persians and Turkish Vans
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Turkish Vans if you've never seen one i mean you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred it's just uh medium size short hair cat it's got he's mostly white with uh brown and black patches
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but they have nice personalities and they're very inquisitive
 		um now the himmy we'll probably breed her a couple of times and we'll we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's just the stud fees are so much though it'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her we we want to breed her with a champion so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right now these are long haired
 	
 	
 		yeah the Persian is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the other two are short hairs
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah she's uh she's sweet going to have some nice kittens i hope
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she's uh she's if you if you know what a Himalayan is generally they look something like uh well they come in a lot of different colors people don't realize it but they're sort of like uh Siamese in a way they have the uh they have the uh
 		they have the gloves on the paws and they're they're usually two colored uh but this one is uh
 		is she's predominantly predominantly uh black but she has chocolate uh paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters
 		and yeah she's she's quite attractive looking
 	
 	
 		gee
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		hope hope the stud will find her attractive
 	
 	
 		and that she has kittens that look like her
 	
 	
 		and and that she has a whole bunch of kittens but we have to be careful uh you know we have to get a particular color point uh stud you can't just breed them with anything we have to get a uh we have to get a silver point himmy
 		so the silver will be predominate in the kittens
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		that's it that's the fun part trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with can't just go out there and say okay you guys breed you know
 	
 	
 		you can't just tell them that anyway but  oh dear well it really sounds like uh uh a business more than a hobby
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well actually i mean it it is a business in a way but it it's a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats we're we're about to get another breed we're going we're going to buy a Devon Rex
 		and i didn't i don't like Devon Rexes at first it's a well actually it's a mutant it it comes from England and uh from in the county of Devon
 	
 	
 		what is it
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's a mutant cat and they're they're pretty expensive we're going to we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one um they're
 		very thin they're they're they're long and lanky and skinny and they have real short hair it's curly as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um yeah it it it's a strange looking cat uh i didn't like them at first they've got great big ears
 	
 	
 		huh interesting
