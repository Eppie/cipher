 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you have three cats
 	
 	
 		three cats um i have a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian
 	
 	
 		what type
 		okay i'm trying to i don't know the first two the Himalayans
 	
 	
 		a Bombay looks uh i guess the closest thing to describe it to is you have seen the caricatures of Halloween cats
 	
 	
 		yeah of course
 	
 	
 		that's that's what a Bombay looks like
 	
 	
 		those the ones that always look like they're sort of scary okay
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's what a Bombay looks like especially when they get skinny  because they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is yours skinny or is it a tubby one
 	
 	
 		yeah she's real skinny she's matter of fact she's uh she's down at the vet today she
 		had her little operation so uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh so she's young
 	
 	
 		yeah she's fairly young we we've bred her once and and that's all we're going to breed her so uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and how the kittens come out
 	
 	
 		oh they're beautiful sold sold them all  yeah
 	
 	
 		are you keeping them sold them all
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah she was going into heat again and uh she uh she hasn't been eating and just
 		yeah you can't take you can't put up with that moaning very long oh it's awful you know
 	
 	
 		oh i guess i've never been around a cat when it was in heat
 	
 	
 		uh well you don't know what you're missing
 	
 	
 		i'll probably be happy about it
 	
 	
 		yeah uh my little prize is the little Himalayan Persian it's uh you know what a himmy a himmy is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well a friend of mine i i don't remember what types they have but they're really really fuzzy yeah because i thought she had a Himalayan but i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah they
 		yeah usually they're just called Himalayan this one goes more appropriately by Himalayan Persian because it doesn't have the coloration that a
 		what people think of himmys they're usually more white with a little black they look like they look like off color Persians
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but this one is almost all black she's black and chocolate and silver
 	
 	
 		hum she sounds really pretty
 	
 	
 		she is she she's gorgeous she is four months old
 	
 	
 		how old is she
 		well she's just a tiny little thing they're adorable at that age too
 	
 	
 		hum five and a half pounds  she's uh laying right in front of my keyboard here on the desk right now
 	
 	
 		wow
 		does she like to sit on top of whatever you're reading and things like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i was in there trying to do some studying this afternoon and laying down on the sofa and she gets up on my chest where i can't see the book and then if i am in here on the computer she has to get up on the desk
 	
 	
 		not on the keyboard my friend's cat gets on the keyboard you know
 	
 	
 		oh yes she likes yeah she likes to she likes to type too it's even fun when i'm on CompuServe and i keep getting all these odd key strokes up there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that come from her
 	
 	
 		yes but she's a sweetheart  i'm sorry i didn't mean to wake you up go back to sleep put more put more yeah put more cat hair in my disc drive
 	
 	
 		right more peaceful
 		my uh one set of friends have four cats
 		and let's see these four cats two of them are sort of strays i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then the other two one of which i thought was a Himalayan and the other one i'm not sure but they're both so cute and they are like big fuzz balls and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they're almost more like dogs one's name is Malcolm and he sort of follows you from room to room wherever you go and things like that so it's really really cute
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh i love cats i don't know most people a lot of people don't like cats but
 	
 	
 		i didn't until i watched my friend's cats i watched a different friends two cats one of them is really old the other one um also had been like a stray but he's huge and we think part
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Angora he's he's black
 	
 	
 		Angora
 	
 	
 		could that be i don't
 	
 	
 		yeah long hair
 	
 	
 		long haired yeah and
 	
 	
 		yeah probably Angora there they're large cat
 	
 	
 		yeah he was a real wild one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh but he was fun one time i was cooking chicken and i
 		make taken all the chicken breasts off the bones and i had this whole stack of nice chicken breasts up there and he jumped from the floor probably about four and a half feet high and grabbed one of them off and devoured it before i could get near him
 	
 	
 		yeah that sounds that sounds like Kitty Cat our our Bombay she's very athletic um being
 		tall and skinny she can do all kinds of she's very versatile with her paws she's almost like a monkey she even eats with her paws
 	
 	
 		really wow
 	
 	
 		yeah she'll she'll dip her food or her paw down into the food and scoop up some and eat it from her paw
 	
 	
 		have you ever taken videos of her or something that must be fun
 	
 	
 		no we're going to uh we're going to catch her doing some some of the funnier things and she's also a retriever
 		the only thing she likes to play with is crumpled cigarette packs so i crumble up a cigarette pack and i throw it and she'll go get it and bring it back to me it's just like having a dog
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		she loves to play fetch and it doesn't matter where i throw it she can get it i've i've thrown it under under the refrigerator and she'll get down there and stick that long skinny paw in there she's very versatile
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		maybe she likes the smell of it
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i think she just likes the noise because if i want if i want to find her anywhere in the house all i have to do is crumble a package and she will come running
 	
 	
 		that's amazing that's really cute
 	
 	
 		yeah she yeah she's she's a sort of a weird one
 		why don't you go back to sleep  uh she's up playing now
 	
 	
 		now she can maybe she'll type something that you need for you and then you'll be in good shape like a paper
 	
 	
 		no now she's now she's just she's just rearranging all my papers for me she's playing with the pen uh-huh  why don't you play with the keyboard
 	
 	
 		oh
 		when i had the uh cats at my place as soon as i took out the newspaper to read it they would plop right down on top of it and just not move and just stay there forever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh yeah well Sheba Sheba the himmy loves to play with the paper she uh she gets she likes to crawl inside of it
 		and she thinks she's hiding and nobody can see her
 		and uh she'll jump all over it and tear it to shreds
 		she's something she she's a stubby little thing she's big for her age
 		she got little short legs and great big paws  and she's not she's not athletic like Kitty Cat i mean the two of them these two are the favorite playmates
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the Turkish Van sort of sits off by itself but they love to play and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Sheba has the weight advantage because she's heavier
 	
 	
 		she would just sit on the other one
 	
 	
 		oh when i first got her i mean Sheba was just a little tiny thing got her at ten weeks
 		and and Kitty Cat took it upon herself to train her and she and Kitty Cat would jump all over her and beat her up and all you'll hear is Sheba you know  all the time
 		well now she's bigger than Kitty Cat and she's giving Kitty Cat some payback
 	
 	
 		she be she gets back at kitty cat for all the hassle
 	
 	
 		that's right Kitty Cat they'll be playing and Kitty Cat will jump on her and Sheba will just turn around and throw her to the floor get on top of her and  you can't do that this week she'll have stitches leave her alone
 	
 	
 		oh
 		have you always had cats did yo u have them when you were a kid
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah ever since i was a kid
 	
 	
 		my brother was asthmatic and so we never had pets in the house we had a dog for a little bit of the time and then but that time i never really liked cats you know i always thought cats were loose and sort of the typical
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		thing you say about cats you know they don't they don't they're not people animals and things like that and i favored dogs a lot but dogs are just too impractical to have at all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah well especially where you are
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's impossible people have them and they're out walking them on the street but i don't think it's fair to the animals
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no not not for dogs especially some of the breeds they've got and some of those you know need to be outside and have places where they can run and all that that's why i like cats so much better they're easy to take care of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you let your cats outside
 	
 	
 		no no not these these are these are all purebred
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		are you afraid they'd get stolen or run away or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh stolen run away no i doubt it but i don't want them breeding with any
 	
 	
 		well that's for sure but
 	
 	
 		yeah with any any weird strange cat around here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we're going to be looking for a stud for this one pretty soon
 	
 	
 		how old is she again
 	
 	
 		she's uh four months right now
 	
 	
 		you breed them that young i mean like in a year or
 	
 	
 		well no well no we have but you have to line up a stud several months in advance she'll be going into heat probably around uh July or August
 	
 	
 		i see
 		but you breed them the first time they go into heat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		yeah you get your best litter is usually your first one
 	
 	
 		really wow that's amazing because i would have thought that it would be better to wait a little bit
 	
 	
 		nah so it's sort of an old wife or common folk tales about you know if you're going to have a cat spayed let it go through heat first not true because when they go into heat their uh
 		genetic parts swell up and expand and everything and then once you do take them into surgery it's a little more difficult easier to have them spayed before they even go into heat
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but but when they first go into heat uh that's the time when you want to breed them especially the purebreds
 		we'll find you a nice handsome stud
 	
 	
 		are you going to try and breed her several times or you'll see how the first breeding goes or
 	
 	
 		uh probably just twice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just twice for her and we're going to end up probably keeping one out of each litter
 	
 	
 		how expensive are you know thoroughbred cats to get
 	
 	
 		um not too awfully uh uh Sheba Sheba cost us uh two hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		you
 		that's not that bad but you certainly want to protect them after that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i mean the the stud fee is worse i mean we're going to be paying probably three to four hundred dollars for a stud
 	
 	
 		wow and how much can you sell the litter for you know the same type of price if they're good or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh we're going to breed her with a champion so we'll be able to get uh probably around two fifty for the kittens
 	
 	
 		um-hum and how much uh how many kittens do they normally have in the litter
 	
 	
 		her first one will probably be about four
 	
 	
 		um-hum
