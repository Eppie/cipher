 		hello  i was i was thinking about our topic for the night  um  immigration problems  we have immigration problems and what do do you think about it
 	
 	
 		well i think it's a very very complicated and i sort of i see perspectives on all sides uh and i've really
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have no hope for solutions but um i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue i have worked with uh uh
 		a little bit with refugees from Southeast Asia uh who've come over um
 		you know to escape the genocide programs that are over there and seen you know heard about some of the problems that they've had and i'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be because i
 		in general like a smaller rather than a larger population to the land area and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		where are you
 	
 	
 		i'm in California which has a lot of immigration probably more than any where else in the country though i'm not sure if that's the case
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we've got a lot too i'm in Texas in Garland right outside of Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we're getting a large  oh gosh i don't know i think there's like twenty six different languages now that are spoken in i the DISD Dallas Inner City School District
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		Cambodians uh
 		Asians Vietnamese we we're getting a lot of um Mexican Americans you know we've had those for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah sure well Texas used to be part of Mexico or most of it
 	
 	
 		yes oh yes  no i'm busy right now Steven  Steven wants me to do popcorn right now  okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i don't know what the solution is
 	
 	
 		i i don't either it's a really delicate uh moral issue because if if you have
 		well i guess the one thing i do see that is is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation
 	
 	
 		to get them on their
 	
 	
 		to to get them on their feet because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in and you're you're dooming them to being underclass people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever and i know that that the Southeast Asians the Hmong people that i've done some work with uh
 		feel really quite hurt and and unsure of themselves when here because they're coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know they're coming from the middle ages basically and they're being plunked down in plunked down into America
 		many of them had been promised by the CIA during the war over there that because they cooperated with the CIA and they helped the CIA out that when they came here the CIA would help establish them in America and the CIA of course isn't doing that and uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so they come here and they don't know what what the heck they're doing and they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities and of course there are people in the big cities who would do like nothing better than to take advantage of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they're they're incredible victims of crime and part of it is this lack of lack of basic information being dissimilated and i'm not saying it's easy to do and i know there are a few people who are trying but but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on
 	
 	
 		and there's a lot of graft like people trying to tell them oh giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it
 	
 	
 		uh yeah exactly yeah have i mean these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what America's like um and it's very it's i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		i couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until i until i met with them and i realized that they some of the information that i just you know don't even realize and know is information
 		they don't have and i never thought well i guess that is something you need to know you know people getting into trouble because they come here and so they start farming on uh available land you know like the median strips on freeways
 		because no one's using it but then someone comes along and says you can't do that you know why can't they they have no idea why not some some of them you know the ones that have been here longer and have been in you know understand now but when they initially come over
 	
 	
 		you mean really trying to plant something that's what you're saying farming
 	
 	
 		yeah because they're farmers these are all farmers coming over and they're being put in the middle of the city
 	
 	
 		ah
 		oh oh that's terrible
 	
 	
 		i mean they're nomadic farmers you know they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		these are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before you know these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war
 		and uh they have you know so i i i do have a lot of sympathy for them and i feel that America could try a little bit harder to to help people adjusting to the American way because if they don't you're just going to produce
 		you know you're going to produce an underclass you know you're going to get a situation that i think a lot like what happened to the blacks being sort of led out of slavery and then
 		then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then and there was no real up upward movement and not being yeah um
 	
 	
 		and not being cared for yeah that's true well what did you do when you helped these people how did you what did you do through
 	
 	
 		well i i wasn't helping them i worked with them not to help them but actually for my own purposes i'm i'm a linguist and i was uh doing a language trying to learn their language a little bit
 		and i actually um i mean helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me but i didn't i didn't i wasn't a social worker or anything like that
 	
 	
 		oh i uh-huh  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i do have friends who have tried to do more social work
 		you know by explaining to people how the language and what the problems learning English might be and such
 		because all the models of teaching English are based on teaching English to Spanish speakers or to other European language speakers and people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are
 	
 	
 		well i'm an ESL teacher yes  i got my certification but actually they did not teach us very many things
 	
 	
 		oh you are uh-huh well you
 	
 	
 		about how really to go about helping people to learn another language i mean it's like people don't know what to say it's not step to step
 	
 	
 		that's that's been my impression
 		yeah it's it's not they're not withholding information they just don't have that information they they haven't the foggiest idea
 	
 	
 		yeah  but anyway i enjoy it they the kids i've worked with so far have been Spanish speaking
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and  but i'm applying for what yeah it is a lot of the words are the same or you know they just change the pronunciation a little bit but i love it i love the culture the that they  way they respect education
 	
 	
 		and Spanish is pretty close to English really and Spanish is a lot like English
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and their teachers and
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		their parents so much more than than my children do you know and
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i like it and what i've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this uh Asian center that a Doctor Falk has started that works with the school district and doing what
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		trying to get them set and inculturated
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		into the system i thought that would be good experience for me and i've applied at another district where many of the children are Asian
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure it would
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think that would be wonderful too
 	
 	
 		yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people i'm sure very much and and i i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble i mean and part of the problem is that
 		a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from you know decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth they became a very successful immigrant group
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but and but a lot of people coming over from Vietnam right now coming from war torn countries are
 		are not not having the same success i think some people have just assumed well why why can't you be successful the Japanese were or the Chinese were or something And it's really much more complicated
 	
 	
 		well and times were different too
 	
 	
 		yeah the times are different yeah
 	
 	
 		my neighbor let's see is Jewish and he's going through the i don't know Jewish League or something and helping a family that's come over from Russia
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he spends well right now he's down to like once a week but he was going over there several times a week to meet with the family and help them with the language and he thoroughly enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah i i think it's a wonderful thing to do and there's a lot there's a lot more i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh more of the volunteer network service because everyone gains from it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		would be would might be really useful
 		um and if it's you know uh just people helping people i think makes  makes the community so much happier
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what's so sad about this is both  of the the man and the woman had a degree
 		having to do with computers but their training isn't what we need in this country and because they're so deficient in English they haven't been able to get jobs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so they'll have to go back and get a degree here you know almost start all over
 	
 	
 		yes yes i've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country i mean and they're highly educated people but of course if you're educated and you don't speak English no one thinks anything of you
 	
 	
 		no no and this woman was um stocking the shelves in a drugstore
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		feel sorry for her
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too
 		well it's been good talking with you
 	
 	
 		well same here have a good night okay yes i do  okay bye
 	
 	
 		uh okay okay it does sound like you have some children to take care of  uh okay bye-bye
