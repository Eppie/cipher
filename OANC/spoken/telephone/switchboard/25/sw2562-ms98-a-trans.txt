 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right
 		do you do garden work
 	
 	
 		as little as possible  i'm a college student
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		if i do any garden work it's only when i go home in the Summer
 	
 	
 		oh where do you go to college
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		where's that
 	
 	
 		it's about two hours north of Pittsburgh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yes well do you do you know do you do gardening at home
 	
 	
 		yeah we go home well we have a large family there's twelve kids in my family
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		so like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so we have a pretty good size garden
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but we have like a lot like my mom likes flowers so we have a lot of flowers too
 	
 	
 		yeah i had a whole bunch of flowers and things well i don't have as many now we lived in the country for a long time and i had a whole bunch but
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now i work and i live in the city so
 		that sort a kind of hung it up i have a few flowers but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and this year i decided that well my husband made a little garden
 		out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it but i decided that i don't like grass i don't like to have to have to pull grass
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i decided that i would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to go see how it worked
 		and mine looks real good
 	
 	
 		you you know i've seen a lot of people that do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've seen you know like elderly people that really can't get out too much and sometimes like we i have a great aunt that lives in a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's it's just like uh a high rise for elderly people and you know she does her own thing and everything but she has it's like a little apartment building and she has a tomato plant year round
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because she you know they keep it warm with for all the older people and she keeps it year round
 	
 	
 		i had never thought about that i could probably plant one and bring it in and just like i bring my plants in every year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that'd be neat well i got a patio and
 		i tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots  and planting them all in it you know because that's favorite thing is tomatoes to grow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so um but he said no he was going to plant in the earth you know like he always has because he's always had a garden out in the country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think he kind of misses it a little bit you know since we moved to the city but um
 		i went ahead and planted one and mine looks better than his
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it does and then i like um you know what daylilies are
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		daylilies
 	
 	
 		are are they well do they just come out in the morning then go so but we call them morning glories up here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that bite you
 		no no hum-um these look like a lily they look like a a well they really look like an orchid
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		when they come out uh-huh that what the look like but they only bloom for one day
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they'll um you'll have a bud the evening before and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it it opens it starts opening up and then when it gets dark it closes and that's it it only blooms for one day
 	
 	
 		and then it's done completely done
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah but um
 		they look like orchids is what they look like but they look like different color ones like i have uh yellow ones and i have red ones and i have purple ones and then they have like you know the velvety real velvety looking stuff inside
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it looks just like orchids in different colors that's what they look like
 	
 	
 		oh that'd really pretty
 	
 	
 		they are they're beautiful uh i have a friend when i lived out in the country and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year you know or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i mean they were real expensive they were like well the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty two fifty for one bulb
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		so what she would do is she would plant them and they multiplied
 		so the next year when she you know weeded them out so they wouldn't be as thick then she'd give me some of the bulbs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i mean i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen
 		so when we decided to move it was really funny because like i said i had a whole bunch of
 		different kinds of things and i kept saying well i want to take a few of these and i want to take these and i want to take these
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my husband finally said look are we going to take the grass  can we leave the grass  i said yes we may leave that and we had a tree
 	
 	
 		
 
 		take the whole grass the whole yard
 	
 	
 		yeah and we had a tree that was um like seventeen foot tall or something like that and he said
 		no no i am not taking the tree you know i mean every time we went outside he'd look at something that was humongous you know no we're not taking that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but the last day he said can't we leave the grass and i said yeah i think we will leave that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um i brought um my kids when they were little they had given me uh some azaleas so i brought all my azalea bushes  and you know i brought i brought as much as i could bring
 	
 	
 		that'd be funny
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		without you know really tearing up their place but just like um you know the people that bought ours
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they bought the place but um i knew that they would you know if i left like one bulb of each one of them by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something you know it would cover it right up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i just couldn't see it you know going off and leaving everything like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because this house i really liked it and everything but the yard was a lot to be desired oh there was nothing these people we have one ugly pine tree
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean and it is ugly
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i even tried making it look nicer you know i tied the yellow ribbon around it and it was so ugly oh it did not help let me tell you i took it off and put it on my door i did not want to call attention
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it was terrible so really the plants that i brought over and put out here the are just about all i don't do any of the mowing or you know edging and all that my husband does all that stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but that's because i'm allergic to the grass
 	
 	
 		oh that'd be awful i love going out in the Summer in the grass
 	
 	
 		really now i like to go to the beach where the sand is because then it doesn't make me ill
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah but um well even up here at school you know you it gets hot and we have the windows open well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning and just to smell the grass it's just i just love the smell of freshly cut grass
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i used to until it i got so allergic to it i don't know if it's all well i went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds i was allergic to but it's not as bad here
 		um like Saint Augustine i think is what we have and it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but out in the country i mean if i went outside while he was mowing the grass i was going to have a gigantic attack
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		so um i get shots for it now too that helps a whole bunch but one good thing about it see i don't have to mow the grass or  i mean that's really nice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well you said that you had a garden what what all things do you plant in it or do you like to plant in it
 	
 	
 		um well the first thing we always plant is tomatoes i mean every year i don't care if we don't have anything else we're going to have tomatoes and then we plant cucumbers and uh we
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		do your cucumbers come good
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh
 	
 	
 		really sometimes when my dad has like that's the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my dad he takes care of all the cucumbers
 		because he said the vines are just so at our house as soon as you touch a vine it's like it completely dies
 	
 	
 		really it must be the um at
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sometimes we have really good luck with them but then there'll be like maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything
 	
 	
 		now that's i mean that's something that grows like a weed here
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		i mean it grows like a weed we have to allow extra room for those because you know i mean extra space between the rows and all
 	
 	
 		yeah because they take up a lot
 	
 	
 		yes but i mean we usually get if we plant for every one plant we probably get fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		holy smoke
 	
 	
 		i mean just pulling them as fast as you can we usually give them to everybody anybody that wants a cucumber can have it but we tried it too where you run it up a fence
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um yeah we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence i mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		i mean it was but we they're so heavy you know they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean cucumbers here grow like crazy
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	

 		of course it's real hot here too you know
 	
 	
 		well see tomatoes grow like crazy at our house Like we have a section of tomatoes and we put the tomatoes there every year in the same section And i swear we get tomatoes six rows up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah now if we have any like the birds will pick or something you know and some of the seeds drop have you ever had them just come up in different places from that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i know we do that too you know and at the first year because i was from the city when we got married and the first year that we planted i couldn't figure out i mean the well the first year after
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean we planted them but the first year you know after we'd had a crop
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		all these little things like we had cucumbers coming up you know in the middle of our okra and i thought how did this get here i know i didn't put that seed there and it was weird but the birds had you know evidently just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		deposited them for us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well sometimes too when we take out our garbage and we usually you know we just dump it in the middle of the garden you know after your garden's basically done
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we're now finding out like we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now because we took peach seeds and dump them there whenever the garden like in the fall
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now we have peach trees coming up
