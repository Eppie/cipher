 
     		
 	
 		go ahead
 	
 	
 		oh um uh i usually don't get to hear hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh you know being uh
 		i mean by the time you get off work go by and pick up the uh baby from the baby sitter it's you know after six and by the time everything is settled in it's ten o'clock before i can catch up on anything
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess that's the way i am too i sometimes i hear some things on on the radio
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i only get the newspaper on the weekends so
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh oh i don't even have get time to read the newspaper except in passing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know i'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i
 		i guess occasionally i'll hear someone at work say something though
 	
 	
 		yeah we have uh
 		a news thing on the computer that uh
 		i'll i'll try to look at every day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it it's pretty much headline news
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which isn't you know pretty much what we look look for anyway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i do you think that the quality of the uh the you know the news events that you get are what do you think about it
 	
 	
 		well i i guess it's pretty good and and like the Dallas area and i get i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this or
 		i guess a lot of pressure in that business to
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know there's a lot of competition in the media
 	
 	
 		borderline at that
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and sometimes i think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines and that they'll run a topic into the ground
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you know they try to play public's opinion which i think is awful because it usually works
 	
 	
 		uh-huh true i'll bet that was the case of the the war in the Middle East
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh that uh lots lots of new uh newsmen were created during that so it will be interesting to see what happens
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it's true
 		trying to think what else is  is current
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well um i don't know what to say
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh that's a bad one they uh looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah i hate to see that but it's uh that that you know if what it's going to take well you know we can deduct that from our income tax our federal income tax
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh you know but we need good schools
 		uh
 		we're more involved in that now and i i
 		i i think it's better for everybody if we had better schools
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i would think they could find a better way to fund it though but they haven't for
 	
 	
 		no you know i wish they could have gotten a lottery
 	
 	
 		well they're struggling with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think you know the lottery could have helped
 		so i mean it wouldn't have been as painful
 		as what we would've paid in state income tax i mean  probably would have paid the same amount but you know it's not the idea of your paying uh income tax
 	
 	
 		uh-huh true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i i'm not sure there's a positive solution for that
 	
 	
 		no
 		it'll be interesting to see what happens
 	
 	
 		trying to think what else is current
 	
 	
 		i you know i haven't seen the news  in a couple of days so it uh i'm a little behind on things
 	
 	
 		well the other thing i can think of is uh what is still going on in Iraq
 	
 	
 		yes that's that's sad
 	
 	
 		and the Kurd refugees
 	
 	
 		yeah they uh
 		yeah they had to choose between the better of the two two bad situations and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know what i've would have done in the situation
 	
 	
 		yeah it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		finish the job while we were in there
 	
 	
 		right but i understand why Bush you know doesn't want to go in and and uh take sides i mean because that would definitely look like another Korea
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he'd have all these people jumping down his back even though i'd agree with it i think he ought to should've gone in there and blew them away
 	
 	
 		seems to have helped him though popularity wise
 	
 	
 		yeah it it
 		it did a lot he did a real good job i believe
 		i have uh in-laws that live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it uh
 		you know we so we kept very much abreast of what was going on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		were were they in any of the areas where they some of the Scuds
 	
 	
 		yeah they were on the the
 		near near uh Dahran on the
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		on the west east coast
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they were just north of it
 		probably about a hundred fifty miles hundred miles from uh the Kuwaiti border
 		uh
 		and they stayed active was the
 		uh the military there
 		taking supplies out to them in the desert
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was
 		it was a new situation
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll bet
 	
 	
 		i don't really have much more to say
 	
 	
 		i don't know anything else that's current other than the weather
 	
 	
 		you're right and that's that's awful in Texas
 	
 	
 		and have have you all been getting rain storms down there
 	
 	
 		we got some awful rain uh the other morning and today's just been real drizzly
 	
 	
 		we did we did last night uh some real massive thunderstorms
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		apparently i i don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		caused some damage
 	
 	
 		it did
 	
 	
 		we may get some more tonight
 	
 	
 		oh well we we've just got slight chances of rain
 		but uh
 		oh well we we've just got slight chances of rain but uh we had the we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning course while everybody was getting ready to go to work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		making nice traffic jams
 	
 	
 		well the
 		the ground here is so flat and it's
 		all saturated now we're getting some flooding
 	
 	
 		right uh when was it last week we had all the rain but uh
 		we i think we had about eight inches
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it was between six and eight inches here where we are
 	
 	
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		it you walk out on the ground i mean you i mean it's awful it's just so soggy
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a lot more humid down that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact miserable
 	
 	
 		well today it was i mean the air was just so sticky so damp
 	
 	
 		yeah i think there were places around downtown Fort Worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time like an hour or so just
 	
 	
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		a bunch
 		well i guess that's it  that's about as much as we can do with current events
