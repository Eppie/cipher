 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay do you go camping very much
 	
 	
 		no i've haven't gone camping in years but it's something that i've done in the past how about you
 	
 	
 		uh we try to go once maybe twice a summer uh
 	
 	
 		well that that's pretty avid to me
 	
 	
 		we uh just you know for like a short weekend or something we don't go for the long you know week long thing
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh we usually go to uh a lake area you know where the campsites are and do that uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		do you tent camp or do you have a camper
 	
 	
 		oh no no no a tent
 	
 	
 		that's what i i you know that's how i camp too that's how i define camping  the rest of the rest of that is really really not the same as a matter of fact my my my
 	
 	
 		me me too  you're really roughing it
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know the majority of the amount of camping i've done has been really roughing it um as a little girl i'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother and we went to the Boundary Waters area in Minnesota so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that's that's really wild
 	
 	
 		yeah are you here in local Texas i mean
 	
 	
 		yes i'm in Austin where are you
 	
 	
 		i'm in Garland
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		right outside of Dallas so we um we have a five year old and we started taking her she was pretty young when we started uh camping with her
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh the kids love they they just love it it's wonderful for them to be outside
 	
 	
 		i know i know
 		i know and then they and they you know there's no TV and they don't have all these modern toys and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like that to play with
 	
 	
 		exactly yes
 	
 	
 		and i like that it's pretty fun
 	
 	
 		well how it really is a good a good family thing to do yeah  and
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah we we try to uh go with another couple that have
 		children also and uh that makes it a lot more enjoyable plus you know we don't have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff you know we kind of split it up uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		good planning
 	
 	
 		yeah  because it gets it really does get expensive if you if if you don't want to rough it all the way
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		you know even with sleeping bags those are running you know good thirty dollars a pop and so we've built that up but no want one bad do you
 	
 	
 		you're right you're right do you have a boat no
 		oh i well actually i would you know what i would love i would absolutely love a sail boat that doesn't go along with camping but now that that that's what i would like to have
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		yes i would too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		would too we usually uh like i said we try to go to a lake my husband and this uh other couple that we go with her husband um they like to um
 		is it scuba dive and so we'll go to a lake and uh  where they can go do that we're close enough so they can do that and the girls can play on the beach area  okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and i wanna play on the beach area too that's what i would do you know  i'm just sitting here listening listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer's going to have with that
 	
 	
 		yes yes that's fun
 		really  am i pretty Texan
 	
 	
 		you're pretty Texan yes but you know you know what's really funny um i've had people tell me that i have a Texas accent and i mean there just is no way i've not picked one up
 	
 	
 		no you don't you don't sound like it to me
 	
 	
 		i've only lived here about six years so if if if i have one it must be very very slight but  the Yankees can hear it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes yes oh well that's true that's true i see i don't think i do but um
 		but a lot of people do say i sound like i guess i have i guess more of a twang to my voice but sure am i've lived here all my life but anyway uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum are you a a native Texan oh well good for you
 		have you ever been to Austin
 	
 	
 		yes yes we went last summer actually
 	
 	
 		there how was i'm wondering i'm really not that familiar i know there're some good places to go camping along the uh the lakes
 	
 	
 		oh is there okay well we didn't go camping we just uh we did like um
 		we drove down to Houston to visit friends and went went to Galveston and uh to San Antonio and then up to Austin and and kind of uh you know doing the sight seeing type
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		stuff so we didn't go camping that would be fun though to go that's one thing my husband wanted to do was on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i said well i'd love that but
 	
 	
 		it takes a lot more planning
 	
 	
 		it does and and ever once you know on my summer vacation you know my week long vacation i want to be a little bit pampered you know by a hotel or whatever
 	
 	
 		um-hum right exactly exactly yeah
 	
 	
 		so we're hoping to do like a three day weekend
 		there's um a thing called Pfeiffer Rim i don't know if you've ever heard of it
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		it's uh there's a town called Glenrose i think it's around two hours from here and uh it's got it has like dinosaur tracks
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds
 	
 	
 		and stuff like that and it's got one of those wildlife parks
 	
 	
 		that sounds great
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that'll be fun so we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend go there and
 	
 	
 		have you ever camped out of state
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		you know where you should try sometime is Colorado it is beautiful absolutely beautiful
 	
 	
 		where
 		is it
 		i've just been up there skiing and well we've driven through you know but but not you know camping or anything but i would love to camp in the mountains
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah Estes State Park is fantastic
 	
 	
 		that's what my girlfriend says yes she loves that place she loves that she says that's where we need to go sometime
 	
 	
 		well see you need to go there
 		it is it's you know it's it's high canyon and uh and there's this little mountain lakes and it's very peaceful and um in in the early fall time um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i can't remember what type of trees they are but they all the leaves turn yellow and it's just brilliant and yes you would you'd like it very much i know you would
 	
 	
 		oh i love that
 		that's neat that's neat
 		well i used to go camping all the time as a a Girl Scout
 	
 	
 		i was too
 	
 	
 		all the time i got real used to it then i felt like we roughed it then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh well we did well we did you know we really did i mean i just don't understand these people that think taking an RV and parking it and sitting inside and watching TV and having your microwave it's not camping
 	
 	
 		right
 		yes
 		exactly i mean we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything
 	
 	
 		exactly right right i mean that is it
 	
 	
 		you have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff to really be camping  yeah well do you you haven't say you haven't been in years
 	
 	
 		right  oh
 		no i haven't i'm um i'm a struggling single mom and um yeah thank you um it's you know time is precious money's precious um and
