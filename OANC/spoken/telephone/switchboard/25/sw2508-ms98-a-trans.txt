 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how do you uh manage your budget
 	
 	
 		well let's see we or i sit down at the
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh in a on a monthly or a biweekly i get paid every two weeks so i make out a budget for every two weeks and
 		i sit down and see how much money i have to have for my bills going out
 		and then i compare that to uh how much money we need to make and
 		then just set it up that way and allot this much money for everything and if we have any left over we'll
 		uh you know buy clothes or have fun go out to eat or something
 		and we're going to try to start saving
 		as soon as we can
 		we generally don't have a lot left over but as far as the long term our long-term goal is to to get out of debt
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		most most of our debts are from before we were married and we're trying to get rid of you know student loans those kinds of things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i in my younger years i'd always heard the adage you should uh buy as much of a house as you can afford
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh because of the uh improvement in real estate prices
 		and on the last move we bought ourselves a fairly large house
 		and i've got some pretty stiff mortgage payments now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the uh
 		improvement in uh income and uh investments and so forth has not uh come at the rate i've expected so we're still kind of hurting by the uh high mortgage payments and we haven't gotten out from under them yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		so far we've managed to hold our own by uh
 		trying to set up a a monthly budget
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i try to take out just so much cash for me and my uh give so much cash to my wife
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to spend on groceries and clothing and fuel for the car
 		and then the rest of it's uh pretty much fixed expenses uh mortgage electricity
 		uh water and uh
 		and garbage collection and telephone bills and cable television bills
 		and those are pretty much fixed
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's basically the kinds of bills we have are on our budget are you know the needs the have to haves and
 		you know those kinds of things uh we don't have a lot of uh
 		you know like JC Penny's in our  in our budget and uh maybe twice a year we're to where i can let my wife go clothes shopping like that and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		let's see my mother-in-law lives uh not too far from here so she helps with our son's clothes when she can
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		that's real good and uh
 		well at TI i have a real good benefits package for uh
 		uh
 		you know like for going to the doctor and that kind of thing so that's not something i really have to put in the budget that seriously
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah no my wife's pretty good about uh grocery shopping and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she pitches in and uh makes clothes for the kids
 	
 	
 		really well that's neat
 	
 	
 		uh which is a big help uh one of our big problems though is handling unexpected uh uh budget items
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like this month the uh heat pump went out and uh
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace that
 	
 	
 		wow
 		so what do you do
 	
 	
 		well uh we have to cut into the savings uh at this point to uh to buffer that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		well that's good that you have the savings to get into
 	
 	
 		
  
 		then maybe we'll go for a week or two and or a month or two and then the car breaks down
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it's the unexpected things that make it awful hard to control the budget
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah that's
 		that's the way we are we've had a lot of unexpected things just in the last uh couple months
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that uh really hit us hard but i've been able to work enough overtime to you know really help with the with covering the expenses
 		so but we've never been we've been married for uh nearly four years and we've never been able to save any money and i think it's just
 		hit both of us uh just in the past few months that we need to start saving some money no matter what we do we need to put that in our budget and just start doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		even if it's you know ten dollars a week
 		and so we're going to start doing that or actually we started two paychecks ago
 		and that was uh i think that was a really wise decision
 	
 	
 		well do you have some uh savings plans at work
 	
 	
 		no actually i'm i'm not involved in anything like that at work or
 		uh anywhere uh i don't have anything to fall back on at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i i know that's not wise but
 		that's just uh where we're at right now my wife just went back to work part-time uh she can substitute teach at schools
 		and uh there's so many school districts and schools here in the metroplex that uh by turning her name in if she wanted to she could work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know everyday but
 		we're we're just going to let her work one maybe two days a week and we're just going to apply all the money that she makes to uh
 		uh our debts and try to get as much out of debt as fast we can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there's and we're we're Christians and that's uh we've only been Christians for about five years but that's a a real a biblical truth in the Bible is to
 		to not be in debt and we're really starting to see the the the reasoning behind that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh because we're you know we're always well i can't be sick this week but one day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or you know this month but one day because you know our bills will catch up with us if i am
 		or you know i can't we can't go on a two week vacation because
 		uh i wouldn't make any overtime in two weeks so that would really hurt us financially and you know just things like that all time and you know we we really see how we're
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know indebted or nearly underneath uh the debt that we have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and that's that's really hard but
 		so far we've never really uh been behind on any bills uh
 		i had to put our student loans on hold once for about i think three months
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we had a a cutback at work
 		and uh this is this was a couple of years back
 		but anyway but we're doing really good we're not saving but we're staying right even
 	
 	
 		well we've been looking around at uh
 		uh trying to develop some side activities that that might help out such as uh creating some craft objects that we can market in the uh local stores
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		or uh
 		uh making uh some dresses for children or things l ike that or even writing children's books
 	
 	
 		yeah that's neat
 		oh that's neat yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i tried uh this past year writing uh journal articles but uh i found out it cost me more than the the honorariums i got for writing them
 	
 	
 		wow
 		oh wow because of the time
 	
 	
 		uh well especially the first one because i wound up buying a lot of reprints for handouts and i ate up all my profits with uh
 	
 	
 		wow
 		right
 	
 	
 		buying reprints
 	
 	
 		right
 		wow
 		yeah my my wife made uh a whole lot of crafts last year for Christmas presents
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we didn't uh
 		you know have to allot any well hardly very very much money anyway for Christmas just for our uh personal family just me and her and our son and
 		i think her mom and that was really you know about it we we made everything else that uh we gave for Christmas last year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and she did really good with that
 	
 	
 		oh we thought we were going to be pretty tight with Christmas this past year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh we have a family dog that uh ate all of the children's toys
 		so coming up to Christmas time  the girls didn't have any toys so we had to go out and
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		wow
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and get them a whole new set of playthings
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		
  
 		now i don't know how the dog has fared eating all that plastic and uh and stuffed animal stuffing but  he's still here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow wow that's pretty pretty bizarre  the dog ate the Christmas presents
 		that's funny well anyway what uh is the economy doing pretty good there where you're at
 	
 	
 		so far it's uh doing fairly well uh we're in the metropolitan Washington area
 		and uh i guess most of the area is still living off the federal government with uh
 		beltway bandit type contracts
 		uh our company is uh done fairly well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah what company is it
 	
 	
 		i'm with the Melpar division of E-Systems
 	
 	
 		oh of E-Systems okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i see what do you all make
 	
 	
 		uh we're primarily in the uh uh systems integrations business
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		selling to the government
