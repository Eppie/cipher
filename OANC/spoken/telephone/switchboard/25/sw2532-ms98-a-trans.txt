 
     		
 	
 		i like everything but jazz
 	
 	
 		you like everything but jazz what don't you like about jazz
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i just don't the the beat the tempo the whatever it is that makes it jazz just grates on my nerves i just
 	
 	
 		so do you like do you like rhythm and blues
 	
 	
 		yes i like rhythm and blues and i like country western and i like yeah Waylon
 	
 	
 		okay
 		i like country western it's my favorite
 		yeah Willie Willie Waylon and the boys
 	
 	
 		in fact we bought uh The Eagle uh on a cassette tape i think The Eagle's even the name of the tape  before it became the the song of the war
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so yes
 	
 	
 		do you like um any rock and roll at all
 	
 	
 		i like some uh art course we have a twenty five year old son who loves hard rock and i'm not
 	
 	
 		right i can't stand that
 	
 	
 		no i'm not that much on hard rock but he does have a lot of cassettes of uh CDs that i like the i guess you'd have to call it soft rock i like Rod Stewart and and some of the things he does
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact uh when our car was stolen of a little over a year ago in Baltimore i had a Rod Stewart tape in there that i was thinking the other day that i ought to replace because i really kind of miss that music but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah some of my favorite groups are like Chicago and uh
 		oh some of the i guess what what you could call softer rock groups they were the bigger groups in the seventies and  till all the heavy metal and all that came in and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's too much isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't care for that at all
 	
 	
 		it's it's so loud and the so many of the lyrics are so offensive and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		gosh we don't need that
 	
 	
 		no i got away from all that rock and roll stuff probably ten years ago and just started listening to the country
 	
 	
 		when you matured  i like some classical to and
 	
 	
 		yeah  i guess so
 		i like some classical some of that stuff grates on my nerves too like you were saying earlier about the other i just stir up but there are some pieces that are really pretty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i think we hear more crap classical music than we think we do because of how much of it's used in commercials
 	
 	
 		right commercials and cartoons and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum they slipped that in on us when we're not looking
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  try to give it to us subliminally
 	
 	
 		that's cheating isn't it  well i think we like the same kind of music  nice chatting with you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 		i think so
 		same here
