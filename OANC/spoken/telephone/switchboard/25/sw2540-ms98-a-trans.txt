 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well Stephanie what's your position on gun control
 	
 	
 		well on a scale of one to ten uh being ten no kind of legislation and zero being uh total ban i probably would lean more towards six or seven
 		um i feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i lived in Massachusetts for two years and they have a total ban on guns and i saw that it didn't stop crime in that state
 	
 	
 		now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles
 	
 	
 		any any kind of firearms
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah uh it's there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught um with a firearm and also i think there was a fine
 	
 	
 		and that didn't help at all
 	
 	
 		no i don't the the crime is not any better or any worse i mean it's
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i i shouldn't say i don't know if it was any worse but it certainly didn't get any better
 	
 	
 		um-hum i usually just i'm trying to think of i guess i would tend myself to be more towards the the like three
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where i don't think you should should necessarily ban guns any by any means but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature
 		uh you know you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one and you know right off the shelf
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i agree with that i i think that the law the law is on who can buy a gun are are way too lax i think that i think that the
 	
 	
 		and but
 		uh-huh exactly
 		and so i think that kind of control is would be good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the uh i you know i'm trying to think of how many times you you make the statement and and just to kind of exam it a little bit and i i know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true uh
 		only the guns were in the hands of the criminals but how many times i guess i have never heard of a a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun
 	
 	
 		um i
 	
 	
 		and maybe they just don't report those or i'm not sure or you know i can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed but good thing they had their gun on them and they
 		they thwarted the robbery attempt
 	
 	
 		yeah i i'm i'm not really sure i don't personally i don't own a gun um and i don't think i probably ever would
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um although i would like to know how to handle one and i think it's good that everybody and i think everybody should learn how to handle one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um you just never know when you might come into contact with one
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		did did you were you brought up in a family that hunted or
 	
 	
 		no no uh nobody in my family hunted uh
 		my father had had guns when i was in high school because
 		he got them from a friend who lived in Massachusetts
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we lived in New Hampshire at the time
 	
 	
 		how about that
 	
 	
 		and he moved to Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns so we ended up uh with these guns and my really my only experience experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right
 	
 	
 		huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		and so that was really the only experience that i've had with guns and it it kind of scared me
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i think that if i learn how to use one
 		i would i would feel better
 	
 	
 		right i've also always thought about the idea you know most sports
 		you know which are the N R A and people have their thing you know if you ban guns you're just banning the the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature most of that's done with rifles and such
 		uh though there's you know probably i'm sure some sector that does it with handguns but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns
 		would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous you couldn't be inconspicuous when you walked into a store stuff like that you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know  if they had to have a rifle or was you know made it more difficult to get a a uh a handgun
 		now of course you know in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		but i guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and you know temporarily a little bit uh offset or off keel
 		i don't know if that's a large percentage percentage of uh crime or not but i guess it would be some
 		but i i think definitely like today they just introduced the what's called the Brady bill the seven day mandatory waiting period on getting any guns and i think that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i would definitely support that
 	
 	
 		shoot that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i agree i the thing that scares me uh though about where i would i would want definitely want some sort of legislation and
 		coming from the north east i'm just not used to seeing um these and i i know this may sound kind of stereo typical but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		that's kind of scary to me that kind of
 		to me it is more like  vigilantism
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in L A on the freeways and then you come here in in the Dallas area um
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah that's crazy
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles
 	
 	
 		yeah that's kind of kind of wild
 	
 	
 		um especially not
 		in the back window
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for everybody to see
 	
 	
 		that is kind of wild
 		well that's all very interesting
 		
 
 		well thanks for talking
 	
 	
 		sure you're welcome okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		
  
 		good-bye
