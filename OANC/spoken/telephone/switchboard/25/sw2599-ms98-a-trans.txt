 
     		
 	
 		uh i don't know i'm not a real uh great football follower i guess there are two basic teams that i seem to follow every year one is the Dallas Cowboys and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh being a a native Okie i uh i like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing uh
 	
 	
 		i see so you make it uh to that Longhorns Sooners game every year
 	
 	
 		no no it's funny uh i got out and got my bachelor's degree in uh seventy three and uh never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since
 	
 	
 		how about that
 	
 	
 		but i always enjoyed watching them i just growing up in Oklahoma there it was always the home team kind of like Dallas is around here
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and there's always been an interest there
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of same for me i i grew up in southern New Jersey and the local team was Philadelphia and they were like thirty miles right up the river
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm still pretty much an Eagle fan i guess
 	
 	
 		i guess you keep those things you grew up with i worked in uh Missouri for a while and uh i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on TV when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals and i was rooting for the Cowboys
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but they were kind of closer to home when when i struck up with them i really don't know what's going to take place with the Cowboys this year uh everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they're going through
 		and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year
 		in a way that happened this past season and i think there's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's a chance that maybe uh
 		these guys are right maybe they will come through and and do something this year i look for it to be a pretty good year
 	
 	
 		boy they uh they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago
 	
 	
 		they did uh they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't weren't familiar with
 		some of them turned out to be pretty good players uh some of them didn't and you know maybe the stuff that uh Jerry Jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off at least we hope it will
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i keep waiting for the Eagles to get over the hump they make it to the play-offs it seems for the last few years but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there
 		and you know they've got a lot of the tools to do it but doggone if they can't just put it together uh you know they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham who's just you know phenomenal but he he's too streaky it seems
 	
 	
 		yeah but they have always been a really strong team
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and with without a whole lot of big name players they have got a few anchors on offense and defense and you know they they've managed with those guys and
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		once the pressure gets turned on they they seem to loose it see that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys and and the Oklahoma Sooners it's funny over the years
 	
 	
 		i guess yeah
 		yeah
 		i guess since Staubach left they haven't been able to keep it going yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's been a rough tow a rough road to hoe ever since he left i don't know why it's so hard to find uh a good quarterback these days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that that says a lot for the for his ability though i think for Staubach's i mean you know
 	
 	
 		well yeah you know he was one of the few who've come through in history that can really perform uh
 		we hope every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through in a way Aikman has done some of that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh the guy winds up getting hurt every other game
 	
 	
 		yeah i i tell you it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because there he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things you know
 	
 	
 		yeah they did they put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside uh it's funny watching them them play he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks uh
 		when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i haven't quite figured that out if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters
 		or uh if uh if something happens that that adrenaline starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now and then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't know i'm looking for for a good year i guess we're always looking for a good year
 	
 	
 		so obviously though do you think they're going to do anything in the play-offs to make it to the Super Bowl this year or who do you who do you like to do that this year
 	
 	
 		uh no i don't think the Cowboys have got a chance i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year and they'll get close to it they'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end
 	
 	
 		so who's going to beat them who are they going to blow it to
 	
 	
 		uh that's a good question uh i'm figuring either one either the Eagles or possibly San Francisco i'm not real sure
 	
 	
 		boy they'd some big changes speaking of them
 	
 	
 		they did so i don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team sometimes it brings in new motivation and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm sure you know my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia but i i sure am scared of them Giants
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		those guys are tough
 	
 	
 		they are tough and they're big they're mean and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something
 	
 	
 		yeah now that that sure was a fun Super Bowl to watch this year i mean i wasn't pulling for either team but that was just a good football game
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 		no no
 		and it's funny you know You like to pull for the underdog and for a long time i was pulling for Denver
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does but he's a good quarterback he's got a good arm sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard
 	
 	
 		LA you mean
 	
 	
 		i mean LA sorry
 	
 	
 		yeah boy speaking of Denver on another subject i've been up there like five times in the last three four weeks
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah we've trying get this new DNB two thousand printer up and running
 	
 	
 		had been uh
 		snowing up there
 	
 	
 		oh boy i was just up there i just got back last night around eleven thirty or so and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground and it snowed all day
 	
 	
 		wow
 		well that will make the skiers happy
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah if if it snowed that much in Denver you know they got that much up in the mountains you know just west of there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh you bet oh yeah up around the Keystone and Copper Mountain those guys will love that
 		well good to talk to you
 	
 	
 		yeah enjoyed it Bob
 	
 	
 		you guys have a good time keep those printers coming
 	
 	
 		hey we'll do it
