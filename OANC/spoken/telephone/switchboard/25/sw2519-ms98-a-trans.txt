 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well how about you are you an exercise fanatic
 	
 	
 		no i'm definitely  now i do like to walk
 	
 	
 		no me either
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yes since TI has uh uh instituted that um
 		uh walkabout i have gone out and started walking even more bought me the you know the proper proper shoes and everything to get started and uh park out there you know way out there in the boondocks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wonderful
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it was so funny the other day i took some guys to to lunch
 		and when we came back they said oh there's a parking space real close and i parked way out in the boonies and i said you can walk off your lunch
 	
 	
 		way
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's the way to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm kind of like you i've never really gotten into it it's just a it's just a chore you know and i finally decided one semester i'm in college and i'm taking night classes and
 	
 	
 		um um
 	
 	
 		i still don't have any of my PE classes and so one semester i thought okay that's what i'm going to do and that will get me where i'll have to do it you know
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they were offering a a walking class where you you know you have to walk you know that like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes you get you get points you know and then you have to go in once a week and log your points so it's not like you can do the class like anytime you want you know
 	
 	
 		um um
 		um um
 	
 	
 		and at the end of the semester you go back in and your like your final exam is a three mile walk and if you walk it in this many minutes you get an A this many minutes you get a B
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i thought oh this will be an easy class and you know and i did it and i did it for a long time like about the middle of the semester i ended up having to have surgery on my foot and this has been a couple of years ago
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well
 		oh no uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know i had i did that and i just ended up having to drop the class you know by the time the final came around i wasn't even where i could wear a shoe yet let alone walk three miles you know
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh no yeah
 	
 	
 		but that was the only time i have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it
 	
 	
 		um um
 	
 	
 		because then i had to i had to go every week and log in what i had walked and my teacher looked at it every week and it was you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but other than that i just you know i kind of get in the mood every once in awhile say okay i'm going to start going to aerobics now you know and and i'll go for like two weeks and go this is for the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		there you go
 		
 
 	
 	
 		birds you know this is too much work
 	
 	
 		well you know i have noticed too that uh uh when i started the exercise uh not the exercise but the walking program uh that i did tone up you know like all over but it didn't get the upper part of my body and uh so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what i do is i bowl i am a fanatic when it comes to bowling and i used to bowl five times a week so i really loved it and i still bowl at least once a week now on a league on on a and i'm bowling on the TI league
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um but i've noticed that what i do is that i have my towel that sits on the floor so that every time i get up to bowl i have to bend over to pick up my towel and that way i get the little extra exercise
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm always explaining to people i do little things like that like you know take the stairs instead of the um the elevator and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i do silly things like that versus a a regular program that you would have
 	
 	
 		but that's you're amazed at how much that adds up i was on uh Nutri Systems for a while and that is one of the things that they really stressed doing you know
 	
 	
 		it sure does
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when you come to your Nutri System meeting don't park in the parking place outside the front door park at the other end you know i mean and they stretched stressed things like that too you know during when you're sitting in sitting watching TV at night
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		during every commercial get up off the couch
 	
 	
 		there you go
 	
 	
 		go to the living room and get a glass of water go to the bedroom and make the bed go do something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but get up during every commercial and things like that and you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up you know just gives you a little more activity so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's true
 		that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway you know
 	
 	
 		hum-um no i used to i really did uh years ago and uh i was thinking about that not too long ago that
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i used to walk and not only did i walk but i used to watch all those exercise programs on TV and i would tape them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then i would do them like two times a day but i don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore i think having children everything just kind of everything goes by the wayside
 	
 	
 		well i can't use that as an excuse because i didn't do it before i had mine either so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've never been i just i'm more into you know sitting than i am
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah me too
 	
 	
 		so but you know i have found that with i have a two year old and i have found really though i'm kind of the opposite i'm more active now with him than i was before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because now you know he'll i want to go outside and i'll go outside with him and we'll walk up and down the street and we'll go to the park and i'll run around with him and stuff like that that
 		so i'm getting more you know more exercise that way than i ever did before i had him you know so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think i think that has helped a little bit i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah running
 	
 	
 		just chasing him around the house you know  will be plenty for you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's that's enough
 		
 
 		well mine are older now doing uh their own things so
 	
 	
 		right right you've kind of gotten out of that little stage there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yes yes i have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old so yeah yes
 	
 	
 		oh lucky you you're getting into even more interesting stages hm
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah see we're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah  same thing huh it repeats repeats
 	
 	
 		yeah you watch it'll be exactly the same
 	
 	
 		the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it does it does it it absolutely does so
 	
 	
 		how interesting i can hardly wait
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i know i just know you can't but no i don't get as much exercise as i used to but i at least since TI has implemented that program i do i'm more aware of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know that i'm need to do this that and the other and uh so i try to do combinations of things but not like go down to the President's Health Club like i see all these people do
 	
 	
 		right that that walkabout's a good program it really is you know when they first started it i i got all the information of course
 	
 	
 		it is it is
 	
 	
 		but just like everything else i was real gung ho with a friend of mine oh we're going to do this we're going to do this and we did do it for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then i started school you know and like two nights a week i was going to school and then the other two nights a week my husband worked so i had to pick Ryan up you know there's always an excuse you know to to not do it so
 	
 	
 		um um
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 		and it gets worse it doesn't get any better
 	
 	
 		yeah oh and i'm sure i'm sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah because i'm constantly running my children around someplace and that's where i actually get my exercise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is running them from here to there in the car
 	
 	
 		here to there and here to yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		to the mall to the movies to the friends to the
 	
 	
 		there you go that's it that's it
 	
 	
 		sounds like fun well it was really good to talk to you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it was nice talking to you yeah well okay we'll talk to you later um um bye-bye
 	
 	
 		take care okay bye bye
