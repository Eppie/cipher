 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay we're talking about uh car repair the last car repair i had done on mine was last February
 		it was uh uh  my car was inspected and then they said that the brakes weren't adjusted properly and i had to go have it uh adjusted and it turned out that they needed repair and it cost like three hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		the brakes
 	
 	
 		to have that yeah for the brakes
 	
 	
 		what uh what did you have to have done to the with the brakes
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know they had they had a whole list of things you know you need to have this turned and that
 		you know refinished i don't know i don't understand the whole process my personally which is one reason why i don't trust the auto repairmen i guess uh these car repair places but uh
 		i hate to take it anytime because i know they're going you know say oh you need this you need that and everything else in the book uh
 		so i don't know  i haven't had a terribly good experience a lot of times with car repair places uh years ago when i was living in California i went to my my my clutch cable had popped on my car
 		the clutch had broken or something i don't know what was wrong so i took it to uh a transmission shop uh nationally recognized name and uh
 		they had said uh
 		well they he called me back that afternoon and they said oh yeah you need this you need that your transmission's faulty and all this and it was like you know six hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and i said wait the car's not worth that much it's it's uh an eight year old car and it's not worth that much uh i'll just have to do later i said i don't don't do anything with it because i'm i'm not worth that much money on it
 		and i went there after work my wife and i went there after work and uh they had the whole thing down and taken apart
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i told the guy i said you know i didn't authorize this i said you put it back together i'm taking it home and the guy said well it will have to be another day before we get it put back together  i started to go get a lawyer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know because i didn't authorize anything and so he went and got his manager and the manager came out and says i'll give you the parts at cost i'll give you the labor for a hundred dollars and so for two hundred fifty dollars we'll do it all for you
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah so i thought well he'll meet me halfway i'll meet him halfway so it all this work done for like two hundred and fifty dollars but still you know the the element of trust was gone at that point
 	
 	
 		yeah that's their way of capturing your
 		pocketbook i guess for those who are least suspecting
 		in a lot of regards i mean uh
 		actually
 		you probably had a better deal that way
 	
 	
 		yeah it was i'm sure it was
 		so i got my
 		uh transmission fixed with all my clutch
 		um
 		just the other day my clutch cable had had popped again and uh last year i i took it my car to a friend of mine to have the oil changed he worked at a at a car lube place
 		and uh i asked him if he could adjust the clutch any because it was kind of loose and he looked at it and said sure he pulled the clutch cable out from inside the engine area and
 		pulled the clip out that was attached attached to it and put it back further on on the cable well it was fine
 		so i watched real carefully and and then  my clutch cable broke uh i went and uh i got a new uh
 		clip that i had with me i bought an extra one and i just went there and and replaced it and was back moving again within three minutes and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there i was stuck on the road right in the middle of traffic but i managed to get it going again relatively quickly because i knew i watched what he did and was able to do it really fast
 		and you know i just figured that if i'd taken it someplace they would have said oh you need a new clutch cable and this and that and you know two hundred fifty dollars later there it is you know
 	
 	
 		gee
 	
 	
 		i don't know i don't have much trust in those people but how about your experiences
 	
 	
 		well i generally try to find my own personal car mechanics
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh rather than taking it to a shop i'm kind of like you it's
 		uh
 		i kind of equate them with some bad dentists
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		who try to find problems in your teeth which i have had that experience
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and  that's a different subject so i better stay on cars
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but the last problem i had with my vehicle was a  uh fuel pump that needed replacing
 		and that's all the major problems i've had for a vehicle that's got eighty nine thousand miles
 	
 	
 		what kind of car you got
 	
 	
 		it's a Nissan
 	
 	
 		okay that that explains it yeah i've got an American made car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's it's been very good to me i
 		i'm going to uh
 		i i would
 		eventually like to get into an American car but
 		right now this one's doing fine for me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but then the other problem too is just a fuel filter and the fuel pump and i've had to replace a set of tires a couple times
 		but that was due to quirks
 		uh if you ever have a flat tire
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		don't ever have it plugged have a patch put on it
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		because those plugs wear eventually will wear out all four of your tires
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah because it causes an unevenness in the rubber
 		and uh that happened to me twice before i caught on well enough to what what happened
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		i had uh one tire uh plugged after a flat
 		and somehow the unevenness of the plug just caused all all the other three tires to wear out
 	
 	
 		huh that's odd
 	
 	
 		so always have a patch put on
 	
 	
 		that's good to know though
 	
 	
 		it's
 		it's happened to me twice and
 		that's enough
 	
 	
 		yeah it is  that's more than enough
 		well
 	
 	
 		other than that that's the major problems i've had i used to change my own oil and filter but i got tired of that so i let somebody else do it
 	
 	
 		yeah i do that myself i mean i i take it for places so because i figure for for eighteen dollars they'll mess with the oil and they'll mess with getting the things off and all that you know and
 		it's just it probably costs me at least six seven eight dollars to do it myself i figure for an extra ten dollars let them take care of it
 	
 	
 		yeah you're you're saving about uh ten bucks by doing it yourself but
 		what the heck if you can afford it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i'd rather change it myself myself but
 		i don't have the facilities well enough all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		so that's the only major problems you've had then
 	
 	
 		who me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh my clutch has gotten out a couple times and uh
 	
 	
 		what kind of vehicle
 	
 	
 		a Chevette
 	
 	
 		Chevette yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		let's see what else have i had done uh one day i was driving with my dad and the uh he was driving in fact and the uh uh stick shift came out in his hand  he driving down the road
 	
 	
 		um
 		gee whiz
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it just totally disengaged itself and you know of course then we had no way of of doing anything at that point
 		we had to tow it home and uh and all that and it was like good grief and the car was new at that point it was only like a year or so old
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and uh other things were going out on it you know and these repair people say oh you need need your your your your this and your that's gone out and it's like good grief i don't even know what they do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so how am i supposed to trust them i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah the only thing you can do is
 		somehow through your own network and the friends find a mechanic through them
 	
 	
 		yeah that's all you can do
 	
 	
 		that they trust and
 		and then i'm sure that that mechanic's not going to do you in
 		through their recommendation
 	
 	
 		yeah i was uh i had my car taken in uh
 		to have the oil changed at the the place across from the the TI plant in Lewisville
 		and uh they told me he says oh your your belts are all worn out and they need to be redone uh
 		it'd be like sixty dollars
 		so i thought is that right i don't remember that having seen that they're that bad so i took it to a friend of mine's house and he looked at them he took the belts off and looked at them and he says no they're not cracked or anything they're they're they're in pretty good condition all i had to do is tighten them a little bit they need little bit of tightening
 	
 	
 		now what was it
 	
 	
 		there's was some belts that needed to be tightened
 	
 	
 		the belts um-hum
 	
 	
 		they you know they were kind of loose and so but these people were telling me that they needed to be replaced
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah i i know this guy that's a car mechanic and he told me i told him my belts are slipping a little bit and he said they'll last forever all you got to do is just tighten them
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh every time my dad had taken his car in to be worked on and they did something with the belts and they when they took the old belt off they cut it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and looks like it's a standard deal easiest way to get it off and uh
 		they just let it hang where it was basically instead of just taking it off and throwing it away and when he got home he noticed some strange sounds  so he opened it up and looked in there and there was the old belt wrapped around one of the uh axle things in there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		totally took him a half-hour to cut it off and  it totally engaged itself around the thing and boy was he he boy was he irate
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		which i don't blame him you know he'll i think he went back and showed it to them and really chewed them out for it  there's no excuse for that you know if your going to cut it off just grab it take it throw it away it's simple
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh well that's all i got to say
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't have that much problems so  with my vehicle knock on wood
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 		i just remember a seventy nine Chevy Nova that i once had never again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that was a definite lemon
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's what year mine is so that's the problems problem i guess
 	
 	
 		well i got rid of that one after it cost me megabucks
 	
 	
 		
 
 		mine mine's still running it's twelve years old and it's got uh seventy two thousand miles on it now so
 	
 	
 		that's not bad
 	
 	
 		no not that much
