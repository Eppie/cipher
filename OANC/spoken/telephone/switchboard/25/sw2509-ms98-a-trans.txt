 
     		
 	
 		what movies have uh have you seen lately
 	
 	
 		well the last movie i saw was Ghost i there's a lot out that i'd like to see i just don't have much opportunity i have a small child and it's gets so expensive
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's true that's true if you have to get a babysitter and everything else yeah
 	
 	
 		but you have to either
 		yeah so but uh what have you seen
 	
 	
 		uh  i've seen Ghost we really enjoyed that i thought that was a good movie
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i thought that was pretty good
 	
 	
 		i thought that was a good movie and uh about a week ago we went out and saw uh Silence of the Lambs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i guess i'm just not smart enough to figure that movie out that was just uh uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i don't know i really i didn't really enjoy it that much
 	
 	
 		i have a friend who saw that and told he me said i don't want said don't go see it it because you won't be able to sleep but i don't know from all i've read about it i i i really think i'd i i'd like to see it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		i think it you know it probably was a good movie i just uh really didn't get into it that much but uh everybody i've talked to has just loved it and they want to go back and see it you know two or three times
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 		um
 	
 	
 		but uh there's a lot of little things that go on in the movie that you have to uh really pay attention to uh to get the total gist of it
 	
 	
 		really yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well i do i enjoy going to the movies and i tell you i've try to there we have a dollar theater i don't know where do are you in Dallas or
 	
 	
 		uh yeah in Dallas
 	
 	
 		okay well i live in Carrollton
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and there's a new dollar theater that's real nice and so uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		see i took him and a friend to to see uh Kindergarten Cop a couple of weeks ago
 	
 	
 		was that a pretty good movie
 	
 	
 		you know it it was so uninteresting that i don't even remember what it was about
 	
 	
 		oh really is that really
 	
 	
 		the the kids seemed to enjoy it and then uh let's see uh before the week before that i took them to see Look Who's Talking Too which was just awful
 	
 	
 		it was that bad huh
 		oh was it
 	
 	
 		i mean even the dollar it wasn't even worth a dollar
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh the first one was much much better i in fact i enjoyed enjoyed the first one Look Who's Talking
 	
 	
 		oh Lord
 		right
 		yeah i i saw the first one and i i thought that was you know pretty humorous
 	
 	
 		but the second one's just it's more it really hardly has anything to do with the kids it's more about their relationship and they're just always fighting and they break up and they you know get back typical you know
 	
 	
 		i see i see
 	
 	
 		typical plot
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so but i was real disappointed in that and then Kindergarten Cop like i said i you know i just i don't even remember it  my mind must have just been somewhere else so
 	
 	
 		don't even remember it
 		right
 		another movie that i've seen that was pretty good was uh Sleeping with the Enemy
 	
 	
 		oh i'd like yeah i want to see that one too
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that was a good movie that that was one movie that uh i wasn't ready for it to be over with
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		it was
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		pretty predictable towards the end but uh i still thought it was a good movie
 	
 	
 		yeah i definitely want to see that have you seen uh The Doors
 	
 	
 		no i haven't no i haven't
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i haven't seen that either i uh when it first came out it was like hey you know i've really got to go see this movie and now that it's been out awhile it's kind of like well maybe i don't really have to go see it
 	
 	
 		right right and i haven't uh talked to anybody that's seen that i don't know uh what anybody's views are on
 	
 	
 		yeah don't think i i haven't either and it's had terrible reviews
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i see have you seen the movie Flatliners it's out on video now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i rented the video i thought that was pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah that was uh pretty suspenseful
 	
 	
 		so my same friend that told me not to go see Silence of the Lambs also told me not to see Flatliners so i don't think i trust his judgment
 	
 	
 		oh okay so they've got a they've got a weak stomach then huh
 	
 	
 		i don't think i uh i think if uh i enjoyed Flatliners i rented that not to uh just about a week or so ago and i i like Julia Roberts
 	
 	
 		right
 		right she is a a good actress did you see uh oh that movie with her and Dolly Parton and Steel Magnolias
 	
 	
 		seems like
 		uh Steel Magnolias yeah i just watched that yesterday or Sunday i just watched that
 	
 	
 		really
 		i enjoyed that movie i thought that was a good movie
 	
 	
 		yeah that was pretty good i heard it was a real tearjerker so i was pretty much prepared  and i knew that she i knew that she died so i was prepared for that just i still cried but i was i was prepared for it
 	
 	
 		prepared
 		i see
 		
 
 		oh Lord
 	
 	
 		and uh it seemed like every time i turn on the movie channel Pretty Woman is on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		have you seen that that that's a good i think that's just a cute real cute movie
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that really is and i didn't think that i was going to enjoy that uh just from what people had told me about it and and i thought well it's not going to be that good but i i really did enjoy that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i did too
 	
 	
 		and anymore uh my wife and i are getting bad we we wait until videos come out instead of going to the movie theater
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh for the very reason you know it's just so expensive
 	
 	
 		well uh yeah with the dollar theater though i it's sometimes it's cheaper to pay a dollar to see it than to you know to pay it depends on where you rent your videos but
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true
 		plus a lot of movies you need to sort of see them in a theater you know it just makes them that much better
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm glad that
 		i'm glad that i saw Ghost before it went
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because it's out on video now but it's still playing at the dollar theater i'm glad i got to s ee it there rather it's TV just doesn't have the same impact
 	
 	
 		right right because you can always you'll either get interrupted with a telephone call or want to get up and leave and that just doesn't make the movie you know you need to just sit through it and and enjoy it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh yeah for ones that you want to see again or you know ones that you really weren't sure if you wanted to see or not you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		right that you didn't want to waste the time or the the expensive movie ticket then the videos are worth it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's another one i want to see is uh uh Dances with Wolves
 	
 	
 		i haven't seen that and i and i you know it of course won a lot of Academy Awards
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i've heard that it's real it's a long movie
 	
 	
 		that's what i've heard that uh
 	
 	
 		like three hours
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		but uh i've heard the scenery is real good in it yeah
 	
 	
 		really i've heard a lot of good things about it but i've also heard that it can it becomes slow
 	
 	
 		oh there's parts in it that don't move yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i don't know you know speaking speaking about making a three hour time commitment  i don't know
 	
 	
 		i bet that's true
 		
 
 		that's right that's all afternoon i'll tell you what but uh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah there are a ton of movies out seems like a lot just uh you know the first three months of this year seemed like there's been a lot of movies come out
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i thought i wanted to see the The Marrying Man with uh Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger but then we saw a uh like a preview of it and it looks pretty formula you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so oh i don't know now if i want to see it now it's like now i'll probably wait until it's either at the dollar movie or on video
 	
 	
 		or on the video
 		that's right but
 	
 	
 		and what else what else is out right now that i want to see
 	
 	
 		uh
 		let's see there was another movie that i saw a preview to that i wanted to see
 		uh
 		something about cowboys uh
 		uh All My Heroes Are Cowboys or
 	
 	
 		is that new
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's pretty new uh i'm trying to think who it's got in it
 	
 	
 		i guess uh uh there's a song by that name i guess but it's not new
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah it's uh that song that Willie Nelson song is in it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um but it's about this this guy that's a rodeo big rodeo guy and he comes home to his dad
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah
 	
 	
 		and he's i don't know in a rest home or something and then they go off and do something i don't really know what all it was but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i've seen you know commercials yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they sound like that'd be a pretty good Western movie
 		but i i don't know yet uh i'll just have to save my money i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and splurge a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but well hey i appreciate the conversation
 	
 	
 		yeah it was nice talking to you you have a good day bye
 	
 	
 		okay you have a good day
 		bye-bye
