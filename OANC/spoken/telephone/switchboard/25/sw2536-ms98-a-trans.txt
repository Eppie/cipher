 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well how do you use your credit cards
 	
 	
 		um
 		i use them carefully i guess um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i uh i usually don't i usually use them to consolidate billing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh for convenience sakes
 		but i usually just pay them off at the end of the month
 	
 	
 		yeah especially what i do
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't avoid the finance charges uh as high as they are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't uh
 	
 	
 		ridiculously high
 	
 	
 		don't
 		you know i don't
 		let them carry over you know i uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've been lucky i guess i haven't had a bill big enough where i couldn't pay them off at the end of the month
 		but i i try to try to live within a budget you know and so
 	
 	
 		well so
 	
 	
 		i keep that in mind i just don't you know
 		i guess it takes self-restraint when you have a credit card to know that
 		that there's really you really have to pay these things off
 	
 	
 		yeah plus a lot more
 	
 	
 		plus a lot more you know and you got to realize that there's only this much money in the bank and if you're going to live
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		if you're not going to try to you know say well i'll pay it off sometime in the future
 	
 	
 		yeah for so many years i was so deep in debt on credit cards and i finally dug my way out of them and that was enough to teach me you know you just  i can do without them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right  some people have a
 		rip theirs up just because they can't you know they can't resist them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i got rid of a lot of them especially the ones where i paid fees
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i kept the ones that were free
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and basically the same thing i use them if i'm running short of cash and there's something i want or sale a sale or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when i travel i use them
 	
 	
 		right
 		i use them to float sometimes if it's near the end of the month and you know and you know i don't have a check coming in a few days
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah it's about
 	
 	
 		i'll go ahead and and charge it knowing that the money will be there
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i do
 	
 	
 		by the time the bill comes
 	
 	
 		yeah if there's running into a cash short or something there's some things some purchases i make that i will do always on credit card just so i have a record of them just like when i take all my cats down to the vet i always pay that on credit card
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right you know we go out to eat a lot of times
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't like to carry a lot of cash with me
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		i have
 		so i just carry my credit card and and for things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as long as i know you know that i'm i'm not over doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a
 		and yeah i have i have what i have two credit cards that's all i use i'm always getting stuff in the mail all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i
 	
 	
 		you are a preferred such and such and you are
 	
 	
 		yeah you're you're already approved then it's back
 	
 	
 		you're already approved to get
 		i
 	
 	
 		i uh for the longest time i i'd gotten rid of my gas credit cards and then all of a sudden i started getting a flurry of these things so i i did i have picked up three gas credit cards in the last couple months
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		sometimes they just send them to you and say here have a credit card
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have that one
 	
 	
 		oh do you yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i just ripped i just cut it up and threw it away but you know
 	
 	
 		oh you should have used it you wouldn't have been liable for the payment
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		huh i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		they yeah they send you card that
 	
 	
 		that you didn't want
 	
 	
 		that you didn't apply for it's yours
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		of course they could always stick something in the credit bureau
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right they could they can make your life miserable if they want to
 	
 	
 		sure yeah i had a i had a tough battle with Exxon several years ago
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		uh and i i tore up their card and sent it to them and now i've got another one
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we don't have too many Exxon stations out this way
 	
 	
 		oh really what do you got out there
 	
 	
 		uh we've got lots of Mobil
 	
 	
 		Mobils yeah
 	
 	
 		Mobils are big and
 		we have a few Exxon we've got some other ones like Citgo
 	
 	
 		yeah

 		got some Shell stations
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		a few Texaco stations
 	
 	
 		we have several convenience stores that sell Citgo gas but they're not Citgo stations i guess
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		the biggies around here are Exxon Texaco and um
 		well gosh that's about it BP i guess
 	
 	
 		and there's another local one i can't i can't remember what there's some few Sinclair stations
 	
 	
 		gosh i haven't seen a Sinclair station in years
 	
 	
 		yeah the few they're the green dinosaurs are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		their their
 	
 	
 		gosh there used to when i was a when i was a kid there was a Sinclair station about three blocks away that's where i used to go to pump up my tires and get my flats fixed and all of that
 	
 	
 		logo
 		
 
 		yeah there's not that many down here that you know once
 		once in a while you'll see one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess they're still in business
 	
 	
 		just barely i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well just
 	
 	
 		you ever you ever gotten in trouble with your credit card where they they've charged charged you for something you didn't didn't
 	
 	
 		no uh i i've nope i've never had that
 	
 	
 		didn't purchase
 	
 	
 		i i did have a problem with American Express one time about ten years ago when i first got started in a business um
 	
 	
 		yeah i have
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they got my name of course
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i said yeah this will be handy because i can use this for all my business expenses so i used it went on a went on a trip and used it got the bill and paid it
 		about three weeks later i get this nasty letter from them saying you haven't paid you're overdue pay it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i ignored it assuming that the things had crossed in the mail about two weeks after that i get a phone call
 	
 	
 		right
 		from someone saying
 	
 	
 		say you are really overdue you need to pay this thing
 		and i said what are you talking about i've already paid you and by that time the bank statement had come in and i had the canceled check
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so they said okay we'll take care of it
 		two weeks later i get another nasty letter threatening legal action
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i sent them a letter with a copy of the canceled check and their card cut up into about a hundred pieces i said here is your card here is the copy of my canceled check never send me anything else
 		and never heard from them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh somebody blew it
 	
 	
 		but i just
 		yeah i just you know i ain't got time to mess mess around with them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		too many people want my money out there i don't have to pay somebody to take it
 	
 	
 		right
 		do you have the Discover card
 	
 	
 		no i don't i i kept wanting i kept thinking about getting it but i just don't use the things enough to justify getting it
 	
 	
 		either either do i
 		they they i don't know i don't know how anybody can fall into this you get cash back and buy into that because
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		all they're giving you back is a little bit of the interest you paid in
 	
 	
 		that's right that's that's right you're paying you're paying a higher interest rate so they can rebate you two percent of it
 	
 	
 		yeah their interest
 		right their interest rate's twenty two percent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		higher than any other ones and then they said that we'll give you back some of your money
 	
 	
 		hum that's right
 		yeah right and in the meantime for that entire year they've got the use of that money
 	
 	
 		uh like
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh yeah it's
 	
 	
 		it it's a rip-off
 	
 	
 		oh it is i there's so
 	
 	
 		but a lot of people think it's wonderful i guess said they're they're doing well everything i've read they've been getting a more market share i guess they're they're advertising and promotions and
 	
 	
 		well
 		uh America's Americans are suckers
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		they don't know how to sit there and look at the interest rate and say well this one is only sixteen percent and this one's twenty two hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah i have a on my credit cards i have a grace period if i pay it off within when the bill comes i i don't have to owe any interest
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		yeah right that's
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i've only got i've only got two uh two cards now i've got a Bank of Scotland Visa and a Citibank MasterCard
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and that's it i mean i i don't need anything else now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah once in a while uh
 		my i have an American Express they have this  a buyer protection thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where you they extend the warranty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh they both can be nice around Christmas time and stuff if you're going to buy a TV or uh or uh  electronic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah something something like that
 	
 	
 		then
 	
 	
 		my roommate really believes in American Express he's got the green card or the gold card and the the Optima card and
 	
 	
 		and everything huh
 	
 	
 		he just he just thinks they're terrific
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i sit there and say yeah look what you pay for that every year
 	
 	
 		he pays for that yeah a couple hundred bucks probably for that like high end card
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		well if you have the money i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm i'm thinking myself
 	
 	
 		get what you pay for huh
 	
 	
 		really yeah you know he's he's impressed because they send you this nice statement every i guess it's every year
 		they itemize all your purchases and they break it down in little categories for you and all that uh yeah it's a nice report but is it worth you know is it worth sixty bucks a year
 	
 	
 		for that little
 	
 	
 		for that report
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		don't be crazy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh when i was over in England i picked i picked up that uh Bank of Scotland Visa card and i i don't know hardly i don't ever use it except when i want to play the currency market
 		um that's that's when it becomes handy because if i know that you know if the if the uh if the pound is high i can buy more dollar things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for what i'm getting and then if if i think the rate's going to drop then i pay them back in less dollars
 	
 	
 		right
 		
  
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it it's worked out most of the times i'm i'm usually pretty good on calling the the currency market
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah a lot of people do that for a living i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		trade trade money
 	
 	
 		yeah i i did it
 		when i lived over there i did it quite often
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and i really i really had a racket going because uh my paycheck was being uh electronically deposited here in the states
 		and the bank that i banked with i could write them a check on an American bank and they would give me instant credit for it
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and i and over and over the course of a year i i figured out how long it took them to clear that check and the and the shortest period of time was eight days
 		so generally about eight days before payday depending on what the currency markets were doing i would go up and start buying i'd i'd start cashing in my checks for pounds
 	
 	
 		hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then by the time
 	
 	
 		the other check went through
 	
 	
 		it the it the rate was either down or up depending on what i was doing and it it was great i mean i i could
 	
 	
 		made a little extra money there huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and i mean one day you know i might be able to get
