 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so tell me about your home
 	
 	
 		my home all right my home is about fifteen years old
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		it's a two story house it it's a first home and it looks like it's going to be the last i think we're going to demolish it
 		we've got two children and it's
 		they have scraped the uh plaster off the walls you know with riding their little toys through it and stuff
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		put dents in the tiles just multitude of them i mean even places it's it's past the dent stage we're talking some of it's been peeled away you know i don't know what they
 	
 	
 		we're talking from from dents into holes
 	
 	
 		yeah dents into holes right
 	
 	
 		i understand we've got i've got a daughter
 	
 	
 		we've got two one of them 's eleven and one of them 's seven and then the carpet you know we need to replace the carpet
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i mean it sounds like it's just the pits but it's not all that bad i guess but you know they're just real hard on it
 	
 	
 		kids are hard on houses
 	
 	
 		definitely i can see why people wait until they get like in high school or maybe junior high and then they get another one
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh we live in a mobile home and that's probably not typical America but
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know there's a lot of them
 	
 	
 		it's what we have it's what we can afford
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh
 		seems like we're always working on it
 		as i'm sure it is with your house
 	
 	
 		because they're always
 		because they're always ruining something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how old is your child
 	
 	
 		ten girl
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		so so you know just like yours
 		ours is always
 		you know we're something else goes wrong always you know it's
 	
 	
 		some appliances breaking or something
 	
 	
 		no appliances we had a couple plumbing problems we've
 		
 
 		oh  who knows you know it's always something with homes
 	
 	
 		and you said you were in Colorado Springs
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		are there a lot of trailers around there
 	
 	
 		yeah there are there's uh big military constituency
 	
 	
 		and is that what you're in
 	
 	
 		oh no no i'm i work for TI
 	
 	
 		well then that's why you're doing this then isn't it
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		what division are you in
 	
 	
 		i'm not in TI
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i had a friend that had a roommate that worked for TI and she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and passed it on to people that were interested
 	
 	
 		it's not a hobby you know it's something to do
 		i get to hear about Texas again a bit
 		get to talk to people all over the country the other night i talked to someone in Maryland i believe it was
 	
 	
 		i know i've been talking to people in Ohio and uh Virginia
 		and i think California
 	
 	
 		it's interesting isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		you know the gal i talked to in Maryland
 		didn't own a car she's never traveled anywhere she's never been anywhere she
 		you know i talked about one of the biggest problems in the United States being
 		our roads
 		and she didn't understand
 		
 
 		she doesn't drive
 	
 	
 		how does she get to work
 	
 	
 		uh she uh lives on campus a college student
 		buses and and uh
 		public transportation
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i had a room
 	
 	
 		her her parents live by the public transportation
 	
 	
 		and i wish we could down here
 	
 	
 		well it would be nice but i kind of like the freedom too don't you
 	
 	
 		well sometimes but i tell you i'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work but if i did it it'd take me about an hour and fifteen minutes
 		i would have to get on one and drive or walk to a bus you know there's one terminal close to us and then they'd drive me to the main terminal here then i'd have to go to downtown Dallas and then walk over a couple of blocks and get on another bus to go to my school
 	
 	
 		right
 		if it's anything like uh
 	
 	
 		so that's too much
 	
 	
 		Dallas always has been no one wants to be at downtown Dallas much
 	
 	
 		yeah but there sure are a lot of people that work down there
 	
 	
 		is the crime rate still bad
 	
 	
 		definitely and i went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial
 		
 
 		and i mean all these people were standing up that was you know during the workday all along the curve streets you know just
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		all around these vacant buildings there's a lot of vacant buildings
 		and they're just being demolished
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and and they stink and beer and wine bottles all over the place huh-uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh that's terrible
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so Garland how nice is it now it's been a while since i've been there
 	
 	
 		you know i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand
 		it's gotten big
 	
 	
 		yes it has
 	
 	
 		i think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty something like that
 		and i didn't realize when i moved here that it was a separate town from Dallas
 	
 	
 		well yeah it is
 	
 	
 		you know i know now
 	
 	
 		where you from
 	
 	
 		but i didn't i'm from Kilgore Texas it's in east
 	
 	
 		Kilgore i know where Kilgore is
 	
 	
 		oh where are you from
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm originally from Lubbock
 	
 	
 		are you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so why'd you move up to Colorado
 	
 	
 		seemed like the thing to do at the time
 	
 	
 		well it's real pretty up there i have a friend in Denver
 	
 	
 		oh i love it the mountains
 		i love the mountains
 	
 	
 		what do you going
 	
 	
 		uh back to the topic
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		it seems that uh
 		more and more people are not owning owning traditional homes these days
 	
 	
 		they're not owning homes period
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah uh everyone says
 		you know when i bought this several years ago w hen our local economy was good everyone said no no you're crazy to buy a mobile home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but now it seems that uh with the local economy bad and TI and straits it seems that uh
 	
 	
 		it wasn't such a bad idea
 	
 	
 		oh they're doing some backpedaling
 	
 	
 		so have you got uh land
 	
 	
 		no i'm renting at the time so
 	
 	
 		i did that one year i lived with two other girls and we all taught
 		it was a two bedroom so we took turns
 		you know
 	
 	
 		turns
 	
 	
 		having sharing the bedroom
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i got to where i decided i wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom
 		and then we had two baths it was just one the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in
 	
 	
 		well mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one
 		ours is wood sided ours is wood sided
 	
 	
 		that was in the seventies
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it has uh a traditional V top roof
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		and uh it's nine hundred and eighty square foot
 		one two bedroom one bath
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		rooms are nice sized
 		well you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into
 		two bedrooms one bath it's it's comfy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so have
 		have you got it underpinned
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		are you required to by law
 	
 	
 		i don't know whether it is or not
 	
 	
 		we were down here
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it was already setup when we bought it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		well i bet it's not bad
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere and uh
 		you know so it's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be
 	
 	
 		okay
 		but how much is yours when we bought ours we were paying two uh three hundred and twenty nine dollars
 	
 	
 		oh our payments are like two
 		twenty
 	
 	
 		for how many years
 	
 	
 		fifteen
 	
 	
 		oh so it was still a lot cheaper
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so it was still a lot cheaper than what we did because ours is thirty years
 		
 
 		and we bought one of the cheapest houses you know a tract house
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yes a mobile home's a heck of a lot cheaper and
 		well actually whenever we got ours we picked it up used you know
 		three or four years used and uh
 	
 	
 		which probably didn't make much difference
 	
 	
 		well yeah did
 	
 	
 		have a  on it
 	
 	
 		no no no what i meant not in quality what i meant was
 		four years equity costs five hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		in the price
 		gee nice huh   that sounds good
 	
 	
 		so you know there's not that much time left on the loan and
 	
 	
 		so if the economy gets better are you going to get another one
 		another house
 	
 	
 		i
 		don't know
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for
 		you know i need to pickup and move somewhere else
 		somewhere else is easy
 	
 	
 		but you wouldn't take that mobile home right
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you would
 	
 	
 		sure absolutely
 	
 	
 		it'd be cheaper to move that than buy another one
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 		when i you know when you talk about the deal like i got yeah
 		yeah it would be cheaper
 		uh especially if it were a paid move or something
 		you know there's some paid moves occasionally
 	
 	
 		TI would pay move you
 	
 	
 		i don't know but
 		they did when i when i moved up here so they might want to move away
 	
 	
 		so how many years you been up there
 	
 	
 		uh six or seven
 	
 	
 		do you snow ski
 	
 	
 		uh a little bit little bit mostly i just love walking the mountains driving in the mountains
 	
 	
 		it's real pretty i went rock climbing one time
 	
 	
 		oh that's exciting
 	
 	
 		my friend talked me in that  i'm a real um scaredy when it comes to heights but once we got on top of the rocks it was quite
