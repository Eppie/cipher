 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well what do you think about it
 	
 	
 		well um most of the stuff up until now in the recent months i i i don't have any problem with
 	
 	
 		no i don't either
 	
 	
 		uh i mean it's you know it
 	
 	
 		i don't think it's going to change very much but
 	
 	
 		no i agree with that as as far as the as far as the mess that's developing as a result um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know uh as a country the United States uh i think our hands are tied as far as as as any further involvement until the UN sanctions it in fact it really was to begin with
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i just i heard a comment on the radio this morning that uh you know it it gets to a point where uh
 		if enough people are are going to be slaughtered over there over the
 		the the internal problems um somebody may step in again but uh i really think it's it's a UN issue
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		at that point because it is internal
 	
 	
 		well you know the funny thing i find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the American public goes crazy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in in Iraq they're going crazy you know i mean you can't please them one way or the other
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		that's absolutely right
 	
 	
 		you know and i and i think that i i agree with you this is exactly the right course i mean that's an internal problem to Iraq it has nothing to do with us
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
  
 		and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the UN gets involved then it's nobody's business
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i mean these these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time some of them have been going on for for tens of years if if i understand it right in places like the Sudan and
 	
 	
 		all the time i mean yeah i mean
 		yeah
 		yeah and it's certainly and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years and it's going to continue as long as you have so many diverse groups that are that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 		yeah that's absolutely right
 	
 	
 		i mean the Kurds have tried it before they've gotten their butts kicked and this is just another time that it's happening
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's that's absolutely right
 	
 	
 		you know and they'll regroup out in the mountains and they'll try it again in a couple of years
 	
 	
 		yeah it was just you know it was it's a very opportune moment for them to try you know you
 	
 	
 		sure and and and i don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 		you know
 		but i i'm not real sure that we promised them anything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i that would have been stupid and i don't and i don't think we did it everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right i don't think they would have done that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		but
 		it just it it really doesn't make any difference this is just a chapter a another chapter in Middle Eastern history
 	
 	
 		yeah and you know and it there are many of them there's no doubt about it
 	
 	
 		oh sure i mean the the British occupied the place the French occupied it we've done it ah it it's happened so many times this is this is really nothing special uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well and and and so many of the so many of the conflicts um
 		really don't have a basis in in uh politics or or human rights or anything like that it
 	
 	
 		that's right it's all it's mostly religious anyway
 	
 	
 		it's it's religious based and uh you know by by self-proclamation this is a holy war and it is right and then uh we we go on from there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's it's a mess it it's there's no doubt about it and uh
 	
 	
 		well i i i think one of the big problems i mean looking at it from the American the American public's standpoints they don't understand the Middle Easterners
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		they don't understand what i mean their politics really isn't politics it's religion couched as politics
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there's a big difference
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		you know uh we sit there and and we think that they think the way we think
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's a big mistake because they don't
 	
 	
 		you bet
 		you bet well yeah because there's no uh
 		you know there there's there's a complete different set of values um there's there's different value placed on human life and uh right down the list you know possessions and and everything else and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases and it's
 	
 	
 		that's that's that's it a lot of the time i i was stationed in in Turkey for for a year and a half
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and it it was tough understanding understanding those folks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know uh they uh they're uh they're so completely different culturally and socially and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and religiously it's just it was very strange it was very interesting
 	
 	
 		i believe it
 		yeah yeah i can i can i can believe that yeah i i don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means but uh
 	
 	
 		now i shoot i i think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't don't have a clue sometimes
 	
 	
 		that's probably true
 	
 	
 		you know they they sit there and and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert well i'm not real sure that's that's appropriate
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no no that's that's uh a a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well i sort that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we make experts by reading books you know
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh absolutely
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i uh
 		i i guess you work for TI yeah
 	
 	
 		that's right yes
 	
 	
 		so you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else
 	
 	
 		right right that's an everyday occurrence
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's it's like our car industry the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese
 		you know came into it and helped us out
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i agree yeah it's it's uh
 		there there is there is it's an overall problem in in in this country understanding uh foreign cultures or even accepting them
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it it it bites us over and over again the the
 	
 	
 		yeah and until we until we start changing our educational system i mean
 		we're we're going to be we're we've already been overtaken but it's going to get even worse later i mean looks who's looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything it's not us
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know we we've got folks running around here who get who get degrees in basket weaving and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know underwater psychology or some some ridiculous stuff like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		and and where are the engineers coming from
 	
 	
 		uh well they're they're coming from various places and a lot of them are going back there
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		my uh my roommate is a uh he's getting his doctorate in industrial well it's not industrial engineering it's human factors his degree was in uh you know industrial engineering
 	
 	
 		okay
 		i see
 	
 	
 		um
 		and he's from the Philippines
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the only reason he came here was because the education is much so much better for those who will go after it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		he has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs
 	
 	
 		sure okay
 	
 	
 		you know uh but i i see it all too often i mean we've got loads of foreign students
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're coming here going after the hard degrees and then they're going back to Korea and Japan and Hong Kong and everywhere else and they're applying it there
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and
 		
 
 		i don't know it's to me it's amazing i don't know what we're going to do as a country we're we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later
 	
 	
 		yeah because you know every every the the country's got a problem with uh with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that and the long long range views are are just kind of become a thing of the past
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah you
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't think there can be anymore long range planning i think it it's it's sticking your finger in the holes and the dike
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know uh oh here's a crisis well let's plug it up
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i don't know what the answer is it's far beyond me
 	
 	
 		yeah that's for sure that's  that's the way things have gotten
 	
 	
 		yeah all we can do is keep plugging
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i i wonder i i
 		read in the paper just last week IBM's unveiling their new laptop computer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well at a price tag of six thousand bucks i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers
 	
 	
 		no absolutely
 	
 	
 		because uh now i have the i i have the IBM PS two
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but i'm sorry i got it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's slow it's uh there are many better machines on the market right now for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan through the school and i saved forty eight percent so i said yeah if i can have an IBM for forty eight percent discount i'll take it
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
  
 		okay
 		um-hum
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		but up to that point i had never i had always said i would never have one because i wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		that's absolutely right yeah
 	
 	
 		now you watch just sure as anything the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh yeah the the unfortunately the way the
 		the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get get something in your hands um it it's it's obsolete and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum it's already outdated
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we're we we fight that that battle every day here at work uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i i can imagine
 		i uh  years ago i remember when i had a TI ninety nine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		put all the money into the expansion box and
 		all this that and the other and
 		uh things just kept changing so much and i kept getting rid of them and i finally said well you can't do this  you've got to buy something and stick with it so i
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so i just at an opportune time i got one that that suited my needs and i've just stuck with it the only thing i've done to it is just add a uh add a mouse and a hard drive
 	
 	
 		okay yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's all i plan to do of course i'm limited on memory now because i've got the low line i got the model twenty five
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so i'm stuck with six forty but i'm not a power user so it doesn't matter
 	
 	
 		yeah well that that's that's the key you know whatever whatever works for you and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if it does the job then that's that's what you need
 	
 	
 		yeah now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		he's he's looking now to get rid of his he's got a three eighty six and wants to get a four eighty six you know this kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
