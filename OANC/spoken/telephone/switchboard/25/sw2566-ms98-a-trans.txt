 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay do you have any children
 	
 	
 		no i don't
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you don't
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yes i have a one a five year old daughter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh did you ever have her in child care
 	
 	
 		yes i do she was um
 		at a private well i stayed off work with her for little over for of a year when she was born and then i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		had her at a private sitter for
 		i guess two two and a half years after that
 	
 	
 		and how did you choose that sitter
 	
 	
 		um she was referred to me by a couple of people and she turned out to be wonderful i couldn't have asked for anything
 		better i don't think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i didn't want to send send her straight to a day care
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and even though she was that old i still didn't want her to go to a day care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and this lady you would think it was her own
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah she's real good
 	
 	
 		it's hard to find people like that
 	
 	
 		yes it is and um
 		now i have got her in a Montessori school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she's really really doing good and learning a lot
 		and actually i've started working up there in the afternoons too so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that's neat
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah i guess i'm going to quit as soon as school the school season's over
 		but uh i really enjoyed being with her up there i hate it for her she has to stay that much longer but um
 	
 	
 		yeah do they have classes for them during the summer too
 	
 	
 		yeah they they go full uh year-round uh teach them now in the summer they have like a lot of field trips
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one and stuff like that it's a lot more lax but but they still go through all their uh curriculum as usual
 	
 	
 		what kind of questions did you ask about that private sitter before you took her over there
 	
 	
 		um gosh  i can my husband and i both went we kind of give her the third degree
 	
 	
 		uh good  i'm glad to hear that
 	
 	
 		yeah well we went over to her house so we told her you know prior well we didn't tell her we just told here we'd be over that day we didn't tell her when so
 		that way i didn't think you you know the house would be you you know cleaned or anything for me specifically
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um she had a daughter and i want to say her daughter was like six or seven right around first second grade and um
 		at the time
 		she kept another one other child um
 		about a four four year old i believe but it was only like a part-time basis so we went over there and
 		we questioned her about what she fed them and um what she did with them during the day and um
 		you know just how she treated them how how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we really seem to be pleased with her and um
 	
 	
 		did you did you introduce your daughter to her before you made your decision
 	
 	
 		yes oh yes and she still loves her to death i mean when they see each other you know they just love each other to death and she literally spent
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		almost the entire amount that i paid her on my daughter either making her clothes or buying her things
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah oh my
 	
 	
 		so we're real real lucky but after uh
 		so she stayed with her about roughly two years and she um she had to go back to work they had some other expenses that came up so she had to go i guess get a real job
 	
 	
 		yeah get a real job full time
 	
 	
 		yeah so uh
 	
 	
 		so what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school
 	
 	
 		well i checked a lot of places out you know the kinder cares and the stuff like that and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i live in Garland and there's this Montessori school that's nearby
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um it had been recommended by some friends of ours but uh
 		it it's an older place and so i uh checked out all the new places that were near us
 		and then i checked that place out and uh even though it was older
 		it was it was real comfortable and i guess kind of homey
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they didn't just play all day long you know like i noticed a lot of these other schools
 		that i went  may I have some JELL-O  yeah
 		and interviewed on or interviewed at um
 		they did a lot of play work and stuff and then they almost all of them had a Montessori section and i thought well gosh that must be pretty good
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you know if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into into their school and they made sure they pointed it out you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but after i looked at this place and i took Randi with me uh
 		i think just about to every place one place i think i didn't take her and i just kind of let her go see see what she felt like doing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that place boy if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them and it's hard to drag her away
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i felt more comfortable at that place
 	
 	
 		that's the true test
 	
 	
 		yeah and she was real comfortable and she has really really done good i i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but she seems to me to be you know pretty quick and smart and she's already reading and writing and stuff like that and she just turned five last month
 	
 	
 		that's good
 		huh that is good then
 	
 	
 		so yeah i think so i mean i didn't want to rush school at her
 		the whole time but
 	
 	
 		no especially when going to spend the next eighteen years in school
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly i wanted to quit my job so i could stay home with her the next five months because i know she's going to have to face that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah really really
 	
 	
 		and oh my God here we go you know i just hate that but
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		anyway so you don't have any children do you have any little nieces or nep hews  then
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i have a nephew he's a little brat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he goes to a really crummy day school uh my sister's not real bright so
 		but he he's always sick i mean he has always got some kind of cold or something and i don't know i don't think this place is a very good place for him
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's just kind of convenient and she's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else
 	
 	
 		oh really just easy to get them there and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		well that's a shame
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think she checks things out very well
 	
 	
 		oh really that's scary
 	
 	
 		which really surprises me it is scary yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i was i was petrified
 	
 	
 		because
 		i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i would be too
 	
 	
 		i mean that's a
 		i don't know that's just it and that's why
 		i don't mind paying more
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i don't know i just feel more
 		
 
 	
 	
 		too many horror stories out there that you know
 	
 	
 		yes
 		and that's one reason i like working up there a little bit is because i know what's really going on
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		that's right i think that's an ideal situation
 	
 	
 		because you don't know uh because like at her school um as soon as you drive up it's got like a circular type drive
 		they sit and they have car callers and and some kid goes out and gets the kid and it's time to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		well at first that always kind of bothered me i mean not bothered me but i thought well you know i'd like to see what she's doing you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but now that i'm there i mean it's it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that dawdle
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know when their parents come and it's hard to get them out and a lot of parents have places to go and and things like that and it's late at night so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know now it doesn't bother me at all but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		is that on where the over there off of like i'm not sure what the street is is it off of near Country Club and um yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah sixty six that one that's set back in the woods yeah that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay i i've seen the signs but i've never actually seen the place itself you know it's pretty set far back off the road
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right it won't and that's something i like too because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		definitely
 	
 	
 		a lot of those places are like you know the one over here on seventy eight Skaggs that little Kinder Care whatever it is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it's right there on which this is on a highway too but it's set back enough to
 	
 	
 		right yeah there's a difference
 	
 	
 		i'm scared i would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out or or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could you know go in and get one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yep that's right or you know in a a car accident
 	
 	
 		yeah and that was one of the places i had checked out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was it it was brand new when i checked it out and of course it was beautiful and clean and smelled wonderful in there but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i that i didn't base everything on that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	

 		no because that all wears off
 	
 	
 		that's right that's exactly right you get some kids in there and it's over quick
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yep
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've been real pleased knock on wood i'm scared to death her going to public school
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i don't know i well i do know why because
 	
 	
 		i would be too yeah yep yeah
 	
 	
 		you know drugs drugs and everything else and
 		they talk about how soon they start that and that scares me
 	
 	
 		i know it is scary
 	
 	
 		i mean you're just with them
 	
 	
 		do they teach them in school right now where she's at about drugs
 	
 	
 		yeah they've um they've had police officers come in
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		and talk to them about it but of course they still have no concept of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		what in the world drugs are you know but
 	
 	
 		yeah and what to do when they're faced with it
 	
 	
 		right but i just think of her you know next year she's going to be five six years old in kindergarten
 		in same school with you know uh i guess ten year olds isn't that six sixth sixth grade you know and that's a big gap
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it is
 	
 	
 		and that's uh that i can honestly see the peer pressure there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that just
 	
 	
 		oh i can see it too
 	
 	
 		terrifies me to death and
 		stuff those kids getting snatched and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm probably a little too over protective  but
 	
 	
 		nothing wrong with that
 	
 	
 		well nowadays you have to be
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes you do i don't i don't think there's anything wrong with that
 	
 	
 		if
 		so i at first thought you know when i didn't have kids i was going God how can you be so protective you know  but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's easy now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh now you understand
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		that's what i'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say when you have kids of your own you'll understand
 	
 	
 		that's exactly right and i do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but anyway well are you ever are you  are you are you married
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		are y'all planning on having kids or
 	
 	
 		yeah we'd like to
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's good they're really neat
 		it's just
