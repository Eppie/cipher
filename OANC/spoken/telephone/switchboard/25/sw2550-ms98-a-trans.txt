 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		it's okay you can get started there
 	
 	
 		okay i think LA Law
 	
 	
 		oh that's probably what i was going to say
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		Dallas
 		i i'm a
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i'm a veteran of all of Dallas shows
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's very embarrassing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah where where are you calling from
 	
 	
 		Dallas
 	
 	
 		Dallas yeah i'm from Rowlett
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh okay i just moved here last April
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh i got my husband i got i got married to a TIer and
 		uh well the first thing my mom and i did when we moved out here was go to Southfork it was very embarrassing
 	
 	
 		really i was going to ask you if you've been out to Southfork
 	
 	
 		they have a museum there of all the Dallas uh
 		uh people and they have they even have a a genealogy chart of all of the people who married who and whose children are whose and they even went so far as to put dotted lines on there as to who had an affair with who
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it was pretty bad bad because i understood all of it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		i i can't say i'm that much of a faithful Dallas follower maybe it's because because i live here and i know how hokey it is i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		one of my uh
 		uh i went to school out in Plano and one of my my classmates married one of the uh
 		uh one of the Duncans that actually owned Southfork when it started
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		and i think she was in some of the shows for a while as extra and stuff so
 	
 	
 		yeah that wasn't a very good thing that happened to that family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they kind of went in there and took over
 	
 	
 		well what are you going to do they're they're coming to the end of their season uh
 	
 	
 		well that's what i'm doing May third i'm going to sit right here watch it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i was going to say there's going to be no more Dallas reruns
 	
 	
 		
 
 		actually i haven't watched it much this season in the last couple of years i've been on that uh downward trend
 	
 	
 		yeah of course they're uh they're probably going to set it up for some kind of sequel or something in the future and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah those TV movies or something
 	
 	
 		yeah it's got to come back
 	
 	
 		it was funny i i spent a a year overseas a few years ago and all the TV was i was in Japan and all the TV shows were in Japanese
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they showed reruns of Dallas and it was great because i could turn it on and all of the people were very familiar to me and i'd seen all of the shows so i knew what was going on
 	
 	
 		so you didn't need to know the language
 	
 	
 		huh-uh but it it was it was really nice when you move to such a foreign culture to see all these familiar faces
 	
 	
 		how about that
 		true and hear hear the weird voices
 	
 	
 		yeah all those dubs it's terrible
 	
 	
 		it like
 		yeah somebody one time was talking about John Wayne movies with these weird Japanese voices and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's hard to imagine
 		well what do you think about what's going on on LA Law this year it's
 	
 	
 		well i
 	
 	
 		have you seen it the past couple of weeks
 	
 	
 		i can't remember the last time i saw it
 		i know that um Susan Dey is with Jimmy Smits
 	
 	
 		yeah and she's pregnant did you know that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and that just
 		she doesn't belong with him
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that they kicked Michael Kuzak out
 		did you know that
 	
 	
 		no he's not with the firm anymore
 	
 	
 		no he uh the the i'm trying to remember Leland decided to extend Brackman's uh
 		reign as a senior partner
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the rest of the partners all got up in arms about it
 		and Michael met with them and said and said you know we got to do something about this we need to make a proposal let somebody else be the leader and he kind of elected himself
 		and everybody else went along with it and they they uh gave it to Leland and he hit the roof
 		and um
 		he and Brackman talked about it and and Brackman decided to try and do away with him so he fired him
 		because he he violated one of their policies of going behind a senior partner's back or something
 		so they fired him they chased him off with the security guards
 		they're fighting out that battle now he's firm formed his own firm
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		he uh
 		what else did he do he did a lot of nasty nasty stuff behind their back
 		yeah he stole Grace and Victor they've gone with him um
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and um
 		who are the other two he stole two associates
 	
 	
 		um the
 		the tax attorney
 	
 	
 		Abby and Jonathan he he took Abby and Jonathan with him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and he he went to uh he went to the bank
 		and he took um i can't remember the guy the guy he defended for murder
 		Earl you know they had a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills
 		do you remember that
 	
 	
 		the the black guy that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he was a teacher
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they they they put a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills because it was like three or four hundred thousand dollars or something
 	
 	
 		whoa
 	
 	
 		well Michael reduced his legal fees to twenty thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that they cut that out so they they couldn't have a lien on his house anymore
 		so he did away with that and then he went to the bank because the bank gave him apparently some extra credit because they had that lien
 		well s ince they didn't have the lien anymore they couldn't have the credit from the bank so that that got the firm in hot water
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then then Michael went to court and and uh petitioned that they needed to go into solvency
 		because they were so financially in bad shape
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh they all showed up in court um Leland was going to try a motion make a motion before that so they ended up both being in court in front of the judge pleading their case and um
 		i think i think Michael was doing it on the one hand and the guy that do you remember the guy that that uh Grace had an affair with the other lawyer that she had an affair with for a while kind of an older guy she
 	
 	
 		at the firm
 	
 	
 		no he wasn't at the firm he was like Rosalyn Chase's lawyer before
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it was earlier in the season she had an affair with this other lawyer
 	
 	
 		no i guess i didn't see those
 	
 	
 		and and anyway Leland Leland apparently has hired him on now and he's and he's defending this case
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and what happened at the end is the judge um
 		um uh Michael wanted wanted the firm put in receivership
 		and the judge wouldn't do it but he said he he's going to give a like a ten day uh evaluation
 		and he was going to put it in the hands of a businessman to to run it and see if the firm was salvageable or not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and both parties had to come up with with lists of people that were suitable to to run it
 		and he rejected both of the lists and came up with his own person
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you'll you'll never guess who this person is
 	
 	
 		who
 	
 	
 		think of the worst well now it might be hard but think of the the worst person that's been on the show
 		uh-huh
 		in in the past two years
 		besides Rosalyn she's dead and gone
 	
 	
 		yeah she's that was weird  that was very weird
 		um the worst person
 	
 	
 		goofy
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		you'll never get it it's it's uh
 		was it Roxanne
 	
 	
 		Roxanne the the secretary
 	
 	
 		Roxanne's ex-husband
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		David Meyer
 	
 	
 		well he's got a lot of business smarts though
 	
 	
 		yeah i know that's who he put in charge of the firm you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think what she did to him was a travesty
 	
 	
 		yeah but he's going to be  he's going to be running the firm for the next i don't know ten days or whatever to evaluate
 	
 	
 		that's funny
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		boy they've really got their uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		talk about a genealogy chart
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty pretty strange well they they've already said that um
 		who is it i guess it's Susan Dey and and uh
 		whoever plays Kuzak isn't coming back next year so some of this some of this has to do with why they're not coming back i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well is um
 		the tax attorney and his wife still married married
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they're going to stay there in fact um
 		Susan Dey and and uh
 		the the wife had had a confrontation about it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		why why they didn't invite them
 		and and the the firm that Kuzak founded is just a litigation firm
 		and they said well we wanted we wanted you but we didn't really want Stuart
 		
 
 		because he's not a litigationist and we didn't figure you you would come without him and and we're going to be fighting against each other so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so it's just kind of weird
 	
 	
 		that that's a weird marriage
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they're married in real life
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		they've had i was surprised when they started having big problems and then i only caught part of the episode where he went on that uh nature deal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and he got real into it i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah
 		that was kind of bizarre
 		yeah it's interesting to talk about their marriage their marriage in real life because she had breast cancer and that
 	
 	
 		oh she did
 	
 	
 		yeah and that was real tough for him and there were some times on the show where there were some real emotional things going on with the
