 		varies i guess with where you are geographically if you're in an area where you got a lot to select from then i guess there are a lot of criterias to choose from but if you're in an area where there's two or three then uh you get what you can take
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i guess it'd depend on the the age of the child the needs of the child how long the child has to be there if it's a five day a week deal i would certainly look a lot harder than if it was just a couple of days a month
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we're in a situation where it's just one maybe two days a month uh at best so we're
 	
 	
 		well that's lucky
 	
 	
 		in only a couple of hours usually what we use them for now is to transport between school and and uh the day care center and have them wait there just long enough for me to get off work and go pick them up
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good
 	
 	
 		so it's nice to uh to just have them there for the limited time frame but the uh
 		the drawback is the pay structures there's so many different situations that these day care centers have to get into they have a lot of the ones have just decided that
 		they will simplify their work load by saying if you get on the bus to ride between school and day care you'll pay ten dollars regardless of whether you road one way or both ways and regardless of whether you stayed there just half an hour or three hours
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they just averaged it all out but most kids stay until about six so it will be about ten dollars which will cover the ride and cover the hours you stay
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i've got uh one kid getting out at two forty five and one getting out at three thirty so the one gets picked up at two forty five gets there by about three
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm there a little before four o'clock to pick them up
 		so he doesn't stay there even an hour and the other child is not even there when i get there and doesn't get there until about four it's about thirty minutes to do a ten minute ride in there little bus and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so the you know just for the doesn't really work out for us too economical to pay twenty dollars for a one way bus ride for these two kids but some days we have to do it some days it just works out to where i don't get into work early enough to get off
 	
 	
 		yeah i can see that
 	
 	
 		early enough to get them but uh fortunately the other end of the deal is some days my wife uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		being a dental hygienist works by appointments so she if she has a day scheduled where she has to get the kids into the day care to of them take them to school and she has uh a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		an appointment say at eight thirty and she has to be all the way across town at her office at eight thirty then she needs to have them ride the bus one way and i'll get off in time to hopefully pick both of them up and not have the day care center in the other direction
 		but uh just a myriad of of possibilities that these people have to serve so they have a myriad of pay structures but uh it it can get expensive most of them run uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		four some as many as five dollars an hour per child for uh what we call drop in care which is the situation we're in we're not a regular so the days we do use them we pay through the nose and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		oh i bet
 	
 	
 		and make their kids stay there we found on in the area that that is letting us pay as little as two fifty an hour that's still five dollars an hour for two of our kids and it it's uh fun we try to keep it to a minimum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i bet yeah i you'd have to
 	
 	
 		yeah it's
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i when when i uh i i i was i was a commercial artist for almost six years before um we started our family and i looked into uh into child care and
 		and we were living in we were living in Dallas my husband was working at the North building at the time and we just didn't like anything we saw we really i didn't want to leave an infant
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with the child care that was in it the immediate area
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that we were we were located in so we uh we  tightened some belt
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		belt loops and uh i just i decided to stay home with with her and we're we're expecting our second child any day now in fact i'm past due  well so so i just
 		so we've been real pleased that our that that i that i haven't to to use the  we haven't had to use day care but because what we found we just didn't like at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well even if you work out the economics if you get over all the other hurdles of the ratio of of workers to uh kids and uh the uh infant worker
 		uh worker areas how well that's closed off or how not well that's closed off from the other noise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh once you get over all the other hurdles just the economics of it uh it's not
 		as much of an impact to stay home as it were if you figure in what it would cost you to go back to work and you know the
 	
 	
 		right oh right that's exactly what it was with us it was just it was uh we all we had to do was we pay off a vehicle early
 		and then i would have just been paying for for that and and child care was my uh salary and it wasn't worth it
 	
 	
 		yep
 		that
 		that's it
 	
 	
 		so it was
 	
 	
 		of course you couldn't have known two to three years ago when you were making this decision what the taxes were going to do now the child care what you do pay doesn't not even worth a hill of beans on your tax return can't deduct it so what's it good for
 	
 	
 		no it's not
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it's it's gotten it's changed a little bit over the years but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh it is so expensive down here for a child care because we're originally from Missouri Missouri and most and of our family's still there and uh my husband's sisters have their kids in child care and it's a lot less expensive then it is down here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's um it's it's amazingly less expensive than it is
 	
 	
 		well what the market can bear and
 	
 	
 		yeah oh it oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and boy there are kids in this this little section of Plano that we're in we're surrounded
 		less than a mile we have six different centers to our at our disposal so
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		we can go north to two of them or south to three of them or just over west a little bit further and there's two more over there there's just all around us but and we've been to everyone of them over the time
 	
 	
 		well that's lucky
 	
 	
 		but the kids uh the kids just well we used to use them a little more than we do now that they're in school and the kids just kind of get tired of them
 	
 	
 		that's lucky
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they get tired of the uh you know what's available to play on and uh and what's outside and and plus they they tend to just shift around in in who runs them for a while and the uh pay structure changes and
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		so we've just moved with wherever's it happens to be cheapest and they happen to want to survive at  and they want to live at this one for a while
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we found it cheaper even during the summer for me to uh take off for half a day since we work a four and a half day work week and come home on these Thursdays that she goes to work at uh eleven and get's off at seven thirty at night
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that she does that on Thursdays and then occasional Saturday's and i can take off on those Thursday's and be home in time to for her to go off to work and it's cheaper for me to do that and take my vacation even if i uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		take all thirteen weeks of summer that's less than uh right at a weeks full full uh full week's worth of vacation and i have you know three weeks a year i been long enough to do that
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now i always end up in a must take situation anyway so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we decided to eat it up that way and still take a week off and still have a few days to for whatever week long weekends or the like and
 		i think we're going to do that again this summer like we did last summer because we paid close to seven or eight hundred dollars just to have someone come into the home
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		at a couple a dollars an hour
 		to take care of them on those Thursdays throughout the summer so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it it's hard to to find the prices i guess that does seem to be one of the major driving factors
 	
 	
 		i know oh it is it it it plus plus um when we were in in the section of uh North Dallas over by Addison there's just not hardly any day care over there at all it's surprising
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because of the when i was searching for it the best the best place i could find in the was down in Farmers Branch and i worked in Carrollton it just and i was i was going to have to drive and drive and drive and and it was just it was just really
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there were just so many strikes against it but
 		uh like up here in McKinney there's there's a few places there's like i think there's i've seen two up here
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and there's just really not very much
 	
 	
 		well i guess they haven't had the i don't know what the incentive would be but
 		um
 		i guess with all the ones around the Plano area and figuring that most of them drive south for their jobs maybe they maybe they've done it that way and going with that logic
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		oh yeah a lot of people drive into Dallas from here a lots of them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it must be on what they're counting on
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah yeah i i i assume so
 	
 	
 		hum well uh speaking of kids i've got one hollering at me so i better head on we'll
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay well nice talking to you bye bye
 	
 	
 		cross paths later um bye
