 
     		
 	
 		okay we're energized um painting interesting uh the guy called me when she called me the computer called me i thought that they were reading my mind i'm in the middle of um going out for bids to have my house painted
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh painting is not hard to do uh as long as it's not in not to the point of where it's uh needs to be scraped and bleeding and peeling
 	
 	
 		no
 		right
 	
 	
 		and our house is not but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap and it's just a hassle to go do it so i'm looking for the easy way out and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i know did is it easy to find painters uh painters to do this for you
 	
 	
 		it's easier to find painters but you have to be you have to be aware of what of how messy they can get and are they gonna put on a good a good two coats and are they gonna caulk exterior
 	
 	
 		right are you talking about outside or inside exterior yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah uh interior's not so bad it's because it's more fun it's more convenient but you get outside where you have high peaks and those kind of things it can be a real issue
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 		well when we've painted um
 		right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there  it's more trim because it has  some of the old asbestos shingles
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted um
 		but it it the problem is that it hits the sun hits it so preparing it is a real problem you've got to prepare it well or else it'll flake
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum  here the
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		some of the home builders are they they don't put brick on the side of your houses to save money so they put up a lot uh little quarter inch Masonite basically and they're painted kind of like a spun of some sort and so it's real cheap and uh
 		uh i've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and i've as low as five hundred and forty dollars so it's just a matter of it's
 	
 	
 		wow that's quite a range
 	
 	
 		oh yeah one guy brags about his his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap and i'm not so much worried about that as what
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't want it all over the brick and windows and and the
 	
 	
 		yeah which might be a bigger problem than it would be uh yeah absolutely
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		so y'all you haven't had any any jobs painted in your house or recently then
 	
 	
 		no we have uh done a little painting ourselves
 		um we painted a bedroom uh well within the last couple of months um and we have we have some more that need to be done but the
 	
 	
 		just fun
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the problem that we we've owned this house almost five years now and  um when we bought it
 		the um it had been vacant for a while because the family had retired to Arizona but the daughter was a real estate agent and she was selling it and it'd been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house  so she told us that the house had been
 		uh professionally painted recently and it looked pretty good you know the interior walls all basically white but they obviously had been done
 		without to much uh wear afterward  the only problem was when we started having the movers move the uh furniture in we identified the various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood uh
 		the door frames when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh that's not very
 	
 	
 		big long strips so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly and some of that still has to be redone
 	
 	
 		oh man just painted over varnished wood oh my
 	
 	
 		yeah well no actually it had been uh it would had been a repaint job
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but they had not um either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they would because it was woodwork so it looked as if it had been painted
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		correctly with you know uh an enamel or something but um it had not either that or it had had not been prepared underneath and it was greasy or something
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		it comes off in strips i mean not even little bit so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time we know what a job it's gonna be because you almost have to strip the whole thing in order do it again
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		hm
 		i wish you good luck
 	
 	
 		okay  thank you bye
 	
 	
 		thank you very much bye-bye
