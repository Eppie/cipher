 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay exercise is something that i don't do enough of and i have an incredible uh
 		setup at home that i that i have available to me that i should use and um in fact i'm trying to get back into it this week i have a treadmill a treadmill and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a a exercise bicycle plus a dog i could go walk and  a whole lot of things like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it sounds like you're you have the stuff there
 	
 	
 		i have the stuff there i don't have the motivation all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah well well i uh go to aerobics twice a week which i started a little over a year ago
 	
 	
 		so how about you
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		and i i think that's probably pretty good for me um i part of my incentive when i started was to try to lose a few pounds because i had a special reason you know i wanted to and had a lot of motivation which
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i did but then you know i just gradually come back up a few pounds anyway which is no big deal i'm not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		over weight or anything but you know how you always want to lose a few and
 	
 	
 		yeah uh never happy
 	
 	
 		i've found that now i i think if i didn't do the aerobics then i'd probably have to do something else because i'd probably gain weight you know because i
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the one thing about if you exercise enough or or even a a a moderate amount you don't really have to be that concerned about your diet if you just eat normally and then don't over eat but you can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because if you don't exercise then it seems like um what you you just have to be really really careful about what you eat you can you can eat like a normal person if you get a moderate amount of exercise and not really have to worry about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i've never paid a whole lot of attention to my diet but
 	
 	
 		but
 		really
 	
 	
 		you know i feel guilty all the time because oh i shouldn't be eating that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you must you must not have a weight problem at all
 	
 	
 		not really uh i mean i would just like to be you know five or six pounds thinner but i don't consider that to be that big a deal
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 		no no but how often do you go to aerobics
 	
 	
 		twice a week
 	
 	
 		you do and you've been pretty faithful about that
 	
 	
 		yes uh in fact i probably haven't missed more than five or six times in as i say about a year and three months
 	
 	
 		and that's for an hour each time you go well that's that's good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i i think it's you know at first it it was kind of a drag because i was not used to doing that much of anything and um
 	
 	
 		that's really good
 	
 	
 		i had been going to school and doing a lot of just you know sitting and studying and and really not working out at all but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		now as long as i keep going it's it's not that difficult to do and i can see where you know different muscles and things are in better shape
 	
 	
 		oh my muscles are horrible that's the main reason i really ought to be doing something like that because mine's not so so much uh weight i mean i have
 		i i if i had lost if i lost ten pounds i'd think of myself as nice and thin but uh most of it is just you know it's just in bad shape
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but i it was i i know how i felt so tired last week and yesterday was for the first time in in a quite a while i took my dog for a walk and it was incredible how much more energy and how much better i felt last night
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so uh you know if if uh if if you can just remember even though you don't i don't particularly enjoy it at the time the benefits are just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh just in you know far far out weigh the
 	
 	
 		yeah there's sometimes sometimes sometimes when i go to aerobics and i get all hot you know it's too warm in this place where we go and everything and i'm thinking why am i doing this
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but like i say it just kind of becomes a habit and it's if if you don't break that cycle very often then you keep doing it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well it sounds like you're you're uh you know got it got it well in hand i i just i go great guns for a few weeks and then i something something something happens that disrupts my schedule and then i just find excuses and the next thing you know you're not doing anything
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think one thing too that makes this easier for me is that i uh do this at a recreation center and it takes me about three minutes to drive up there
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		if i had to go you know several miles if it took me ten or fifteen or twenty minutes each way i probably would quit doing it
 	
 	
 		do you go right after work
 	
 	
 		no uh in fact that's kind of uh one of the things that's uh funny about it is i go at eight o'clock at night
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and you'd think well who wants to get up and go then but um it's really not been that much of a problem
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so it's during the week
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you go during the week
 	
 	
 		yeah well my husband and i were also doing quite a bit of walking but we got off of that a little bit
 		uh mostly you know with the winter months and all it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		seems like there are too many reasons that you can't go because of the weather and things and
 	
 	
 		does he go to have an exercise program too
 	
 	
 		not really and he needs to but uh he's a CPA so at the moment he's snowed under until after tax season but i'm definitely going to get him back on something because he has a few
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		kind of nagging health things that i think you know some more exercise would help
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so yours is a class an aerobics class that you go to
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but some men i guess are not too comfortable doing that but
 	
 	
 		yeah we've had a couple of them in the class and oh uh they've kind of stuck with it one of them though has been coming with his girlfriend and they're about to get married in a couple of weeks so it might be interesting to see if they stick with it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um i also swim quite a bit in the summer time
 	
 	
 		gosh you work you sound like my sister i have a sister in Nevada who who is really into i mean she's very athletic anyway she always has been she was the athletic person in the family and she swims and she
 		you know cross country skis and does all this stuff it sounds like you sound like the same type
 	
 	
 		well i'm not gung ho you know i but i'm not opposed to any of of you know kinds of things i just don't do a lot of them
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it's tough to to work everything in that you want to accomplish and i have a lot of other interests
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh it's too bad we can't talk about your other interests but we just have to talk about exercise
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so well keep up the good work and i'm going to i'm going to
 	
 	
 		well
 		well you'll have to  start working on your machines because that's nice that you have those things
 	
 	
 		well i told a friend of mine whose got a real she really does have a weight problem i said well i have an exercise bike that's sitting over here that's collecting dust and i i have my treadmill and i have a rowing machine
 		and a trampoline i said i'll come over this afternoon and you can borrow the the exercise the exercise bicycle at least maybe it'll get some use so um you know we're going to try to she's got
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		about fifty pounds that she needs to lose so uh you know even though that sounds that's bad it it may be easier for her to lose that for me to lose ten then for me to lose ten
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm i'm going to you know try to help her and that will kind of help to get me you know make me want to do things too so yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that might be good i have a a friend who uh needed to lose a lot of weight and she and uh another
 		friend of hers decided to start walking and they were doing i don't know several miles each night and boy she really got the weight off yeah really
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah kind of kind of having a a a buddy or somebody to kind of stir you on and and
 		you know keep your motivation level up too i think sometimes might help so i was thinking maybe your husband would you know maybe the two of y'all i mean if he had come on let's go or you you know and y'all kind of did it together in a way that helps
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 		yeah it it helps a lot with the walking because otherwise it's just plain boring
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh to me at least i don't like to go out by myself but that's when we do the most talking and you know about things that have taken place during the day and
 	
 	
 		that's yeah
 	
 	
 		all sorts of things that i don't think you know we typically do  we don't take that much time to talk
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		well maybe if the with the weather getting so nice and
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		after you come home from aerobics make him go for a walk with you  while you cool down
 	
 	
 		well i enjoyed talking to you all right bye-bye
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you too bye-bye
