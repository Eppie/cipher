 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how are you tonight
 	
 	
 		i'm fine
 	
 	
 		are you a Native American
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so you are real  so all the rest of us are um immigrants
 	
 	
 		i guess  why
 	
 	
 		it's kind of interesting that they would do how do you feel about the idea of letting all these foreigners in
 	
 	
 		it doesn't well to a point it's okay
 		you know i don't mind
 		i've never had a problem with them letting people in i just don't think that they they are right in some of the things they do
 	
 	
 		well do you think there should be restrictions on uh who you should let in the states
 	
 	
 		no because then you get to the problem of then then you're not a free country anymore okay
 	
 	
 		well what about if somebody was um is sick say they have AIDS or something
 	
 	
 		uh it doesn't matter everybody over here has got it anyway they're you know AIDS is AIDS as long as if they tell you before they come here that's fine you know that they got AIDS but then all you have to do is make sure they're not passing it around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but then they don't know how it really you know to me they don't know nothing about AIDS anyway so
 	
 	
 		yeah that it it's really sad that uh but apparently they're they're i think there are some rules that won't let people in who have
 	
 	
 		that's just a different you know
 		my my problem with immigration is when you take people that has been here on welfare or trying to make it
 		and you know the united States gives people that come into the country more money to start their life than the people that's already here that's trying
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this is that's the only fallback i see because i've seen like when the Vietnamese come over they get they have stores
 		and you know Uncle Sam done bought uh uh you know Uncle Sam had to pay for it they gave them that loan but people over here can't even get a small business loan like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's harder for somebody from America to get a loan from their own country when a foreigner can get more and i don't think that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah that that can really be a problem i know in in in New York there's a problem with the Koreans that uh that that the uh black community is complaining that the Koreans are taking over
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		what is the yeah that and then you have well then you have the well no Mexicans they they don't take over too much they just they just make more money
 	
 	
 		well i have a friend that's married to a in fact he went went to Korea and married a Korean and brought her home and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's a lot
 	
 	
 		the problem was that that she is a real hard worker and has started a a couple of businesses and now she's started a Korean health food store and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she's really a go-getter that uh and she started off uh cleaning uh houses
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh then she found out that these automobile dealerships needed and so she got some people to help her and she had one and then she was doing a good job and she wound up having uh eight or ten automobile dealerships
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that she was cleaning and and
 		apparently uh her her husband is sort of watching the money for her but apparently she's a really a hard worker and willing to do the hard work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and has been able and now she's made enough money to start this health food store i don't know how she's doing but it i guess you have to admire the people who have come in and work and don't you know don't take money from the government
 	
 	
 		yeah now that's all right i don't mind people that work for what they do i give them a and if and if they work so hard and then get give them a small that's fine i just don't think that the handouts are equal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no it it it's also kind of
 	
 	
 		okay that's what i'm saying there there's so much problem with the handouts and then now by the economy being like it is this is the worst time they could have for everybody coming into the United States
 	
 	
 		well and the problem is that the jobs it's it's like the minimum wage everybody saying well i made the minimum wage but my son i have a seventeen year old son and he's saying well he'll go out and work at minimum wage
 		well the problem is uh minimum wage is not enough to live on
 	
 	
 		no it's not and if it's uh it's just like my husband well we was talking about it before he sold his truck he was a truck driver now for him to actually make money
 		he would have to make almost nine dollars a hour that's just to live
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay but you can't find no jobs like that
 	
 	
 		no you don't and and and that's what i think is so sad about the whole uh proposition and if you've got all these people who come and work for for nothing and uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 		for nothing that's where you problem comes in is because some people will work for nothing when other people won't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then that's why you have your i think that's where the the the line is even in Japan in Japan though it's the same way
 		they have their their economy is booming because of the United States
 		if you don't understand that and i i i sit and i think about it but the the car the car market over the the automobile industry you know it's been the United States for so long and the last
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		fifteen twenty years the Japanese have just taken over
 	
 	
 		yeah why do you do you do you think that has any anything to do though with uh
 	
 	
 		i think it has a lot to do with the price of a car and how much see to me they people don't look at it but if you take a Japanese car and bring it over here they sell it for the same amount of American car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay if you take an American car and take it to Japan you can't even hardly you couldn't afford it
 	
 	
 		what what about cars that are that
 	
 	
 		so our our import tax on them is no big deal but their their tax on us and you can't you can't do that plus they can make it cheaper because they don't pay that much
 	
 	
 		well what about the what about the fact that it is right across the border in Mexico
 	
 	
 		the what is
 	
 	
 		well you know i don't know if you know
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't like the idea of the illegal aliens
 	
 	
 		well but no i'm talking about the idea of the that the company set up uh factories right across the border Right across the Texas border in Mexico
 	
 	
 		i don't
 		oh that's just that's just so that the uh now see they made more money down there and they got real cheap labor in Mexico
 	
 	
 		well you you you think you think that's worse than than having the Mexicans come across the border and work in the factory of the United States and take jobs away from Americans
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i no i think it would be better if they would stay down there and get right papers to come across the border
 	
 	
 		well but but what you think of the of of the big uh the big companies that uh that that set up factories in Mexico and basically move jobs out of the United States down to Mexico
 	
 	
 		well there's a lot of companies TI do that TI got companies in Mexico i don't if it's in Mexico Mexico but they got them in in foreign countries
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's in
 	
 	
 		you know so but but
 	
 	
 		anyway but but do you think but the thing is down if they put a factory down there that means that there's more jobs for those people so they're not crossing the border you
 	
 	
 		as much
 		but some of them are still crossing not because of i know a lot of times i don't think it's just because of the money i think it's because they don't they the the the country themselves
 		you know like the government should i say
 		because everybody's not free to do what they want to do in every country
 	
 	
 		but but do you think do you think that's why there's so many people that want to come to the United States because of freedom or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you think that's the main reason do you think the
 	
 	
 		i think it's freedom and the and and to and the right to do what you want to do
 	
 	
 		as opposed to well
 	
 	
 		doing what the government wants you to do or been doing the government thinks you're able to do so it's the same thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the government forcing you or taking more of your money than you want to give them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i can make a million dollars and i know exactly Uncle Sam can't take half my money they can take  whatever the percentage is for that amount you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah but do you but the what about the do do you think that's fair for for people that come in here from say like the Koreans i know i know a lot of Koreans that's why um and and you think it's fair
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		the only thing about a Korean or the or the Vietnamese that like i said i don't like is
 		the idea like i said is i don't mind them because they can do anything they want to do and as long as they don't take jobs but see a lot of the jobs they're taking people don't realize nobody else wants
 	
 	
 		well yeah we were yeah well we had uh we knew some Laotians and and uh the job they took uh you know basically are cleaning jobs
 	
 	
 		you see what i'm saying
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um of course there's a lot of money in cleaning you know if you get a good business going
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know there's there's a lot of money to be made for cleaning but they um
 	
 	
 		but see just like her Korean food store okay that's mostly for Koreans
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and that's just like over here on on on Walnut and uh Plano Road or is it Jupiter one of them streets anyway
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that whole section is nothing but but like Chinese or or Korean foreign i don't what it is
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah
 		yeah it is and i find that uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 		and that's because they cater to their own people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which people don't realize it but there is a lot of them here and that way they can make money because they make money and then they put it right back into to somebody elses business
 	
 	
 		and that that's interesting they would i was reading something that said that they way
 	
 	
 		and and there that is wrong with America people don't put they money back into the same thing that's why Americans buy foreign if Americans would buy American cars we wouldn't have to worry about none of this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah what they were saying is that these uh people come in and they will uh they will uh live on say twenty percent of what they make and and they'll put four or five families in in one apartment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and
 	
 	
 		but see some people you can't do that to some apartments won't let you do that and then a lot of people you can't like i don't think i could live with my sister
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's another thing
 	
 	
 		okay families American families don't get along that good enough to stick together
 	
 	
 		no but the idea though is well is if if you could put two or three families in a in a together they'd be a lot easier and apparently they all just save their money and and uh and buy a bunch of things
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's why now that works if you can find somebody to do it with but it's very rare that you can find somebody to do it with
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well most of us like our freedom you know we like to be left alone and we like uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know we like to have our own room and you know you
