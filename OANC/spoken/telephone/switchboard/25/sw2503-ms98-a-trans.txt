 
     		
 	
 		hi Wanet how are you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ah doing fine where you from
 	
 	
 		i'm from New England Massachusetts
 	
 	
 		okay i'm from Berkeley California
 	
 	
 		wow this is quite a quite a long distance
 	
 	
 		ah certainly is
 	
 	
 		do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		no used to used to but  none none right now
 	
 	
 		how come uh you don't have any now you get tired of them
 	
 	
 		well i i live in an apartment building and and uh and and
 		it it's just just not feasible you know i'd love to have a dog you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've got a little doggy uh that i've had quite uh quite a long time in fact she just turned sixteen years old New Year's Eve
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		is she
 	
 	
 		i beg your pardon
 	
 	
 		what is she
 	
 	
 		she's uh uh uh a poodle of a toy poodle a toy poodle  and she's
 	
 	
 		ah
 		ah my got my mom a teacup poodle not too long ago
 	
 	
 		
 
 		this is a little bigger than a teacup
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it's funny how uh how i i uh i got acquired this animal uh when i was uh married my uh ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she needed uh the woman needed someone to babysit
 		and uh this is what she had told the kids and she even told me that
 		and after the two week period was up
 		uh she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it well after you had an animal for a couple of weeks it's uh you become attached you become attached to it
 	
 	
 		oh for sure
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so i've had this dog now for for sixteen years and she's been a lot of company
 		uh she's uh
 		however getting a little old and things are starting to fail
 		um i i live alone now and she stays in the house all day while i go to work  and uh she's been holding herself pretty well
 		the uh up until uh you know recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is  and uh i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but she's she's usually pretty good
 	
 	
 		yes well my my mother has one it's uh it's uh teacup and uh it's made such a difference for her but you know just
 		i i i you know the way my mom's presence countenance it it's just just for having a puppy but you know having this dog she's had it for i guess three years now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh possibly four but uh it was it it's it's really made such a difference from her i really would like to i'm a disabled person so i'm unable to to really take care of a pet and if if that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		weren't so i would certainly certainly have one i just i just it frustrates me sometime not being able to have a dog
 	
 	
 		um well you might wanna get yourself uh an animal that doesn't require much attention like a cat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah well yeah uh i i i typically am not a cat person
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have a friend that uh has on occasion um brought her cat over for me to keep for you know time to time and
 		and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen and uh uh it would sleep on my chest
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know it's just it is just a great cat but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well my my personal preference is is a dog uh i don't know that uh that i'd ever want a cat oh i like cats i just wouldn't wanna  own one uh they're not uh they're they're affectionate but they yeah i don't know i can't seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog
 	
 	
 		yeah well you don't own cats
 		yeah you they they own you
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		or or you know grant you with their presence you know
 	
 	
 		yeah right that your supposed to appreciate them well my my dog when i came home uh when i come home in evenings she my dog greets me at the door i don't know that a cat would do that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to have a  that that could read me better than any human being in my life
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i could just walk in the door and she knew whether to to to quietly come up to me or to just run and and knock me over
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean she really could pick up on my mood  the way i walked in the door it was uncanny
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		hm
 		i i think um you know we're able to read each other pretty well because uh  she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too
 		so i know like when she has an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when she when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh and and you know some people might not believe that but uh but i do
 	
 	
 		oh hey sure
 		oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out
 		she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did yeah
 	
 	
 		really yes well i had that that cat that i mentioned
 		i'll be one morning and you know the first thing you do is you get up and you you you you you you feed this cat something something and and you make sure that it can get to its litterbox well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		some reason during the night the the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
 		and uh the next morning uh when my roommate got up and
 		and uh did not feed it right away
 		it decided that it was going to protest and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket for me looking looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right have i got your attention now
 	
 	
 		oh yes animals have a way of talking
 	
 	
 		well it did i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day
 	
 	
 		i i don't know that i'd uh that i'd trade my dog in for the world uh it was about two years ago she got sick on me and i took her to the uh to the vet's because she wasn't eating
 		and and uh she wasn't able to jump she you know lost all her activity  and uh she stayed there for one day and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that
 		uh she wasn't she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working hospital dog hospital animal hospital
 		so i took his suggestion and i  uh took the the dog to a hospital a dog hospital and they said that they'd keep her there for three days
 		well she ended up staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care i mean it cost me over five hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		ouch
 	
 	
 		plus the the uh  the vet sent me a bill for what he did
 		and uh and then she recouped she was okay for a couple of years and then she got sick on me again and i brought her to a different vet this time and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything and uh he
 		gave me the medication the same medication that i gave her the last time and she was okay and she's been okay ever since it's been about two years now
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well that's great it really is i  i'm glad you she was able to pull out of it uh  and so cheaply the second time
 	
 	
 		yeah well the see the problem is if if the if someone wouldn't have came up
 		to me and said it's gonna cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive what do you wanna do i probably would've had second thoughts but what they well what they do is is they say well it's gonna cost
 	
 	
 		yeah of course you would
 	
 	
 		you know twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this and and you know and it creeps up on you you don't know that
 		you know  you really you you don't know what it's gonna cost until it's all over
 	
 	
 		i
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh to give you an example my mom uh had an elderly cat who uh who evidently evidently got old uh and uh the cat got sick so she took the cat to the vet
 		and she had the cat there for two days and then the cat died so the doctor had called her up and said uh your cat died and you owe me this bill
 		and oh by the way do you want me to to bury the cat  so it cost her three hundred dollars um and she didn't get the cat back so you know they had to pay for all the the medical uh bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh you know she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good   so that that was a kind of a surprise  at least at
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really
 		jeez yeah you kind of wonder what really happened
 	
 	
 		yeah well even the you know they they claimed they did the best that they could and then the cat uh died so
 		now i'm looking for another cat for them um i i've i've got a little kitten uh that's still uh oh it just being born right now so another five or six weeks i'll be bringing the little kitten over to uh to my folks
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 		
   
 		well that that that that will make their day
 	
 	
 		yeah it i think it will because they're both in their in their seventies and uh the cat uh although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes turned out it turns out to be a a pleasant experience for them uh i think that they enjoy that
 	
 	
 		only work initially
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for cats anyway you know well listen it's been a pleasure talking to you
 	
 	
 		yep
 		well same here
 	
 	
 		and you take care
 	
 	
 		okay  bye now
 	
 	
 		yeah maybe  maybe we'll talk again sometime
 	
 	
 		okay what is that sound
 	
 	
 		that's my buzzer at the door
 	
 	
 		oh okay i'll let you go
 	
 	
 		okay thank you
 	
 	
 		right
