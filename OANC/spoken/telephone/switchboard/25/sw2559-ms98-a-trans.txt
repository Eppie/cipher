 
     		
 	
 		well on this subject of invasion of privacy yes it's very easy for anybody to find out about you
 		your
 	
 	
 		well i don't really like that very much
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah uh the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast i think last week or so ago it detailed how this one person went about
 		finding out this particular person from this particular person his home mortgage how much he pays for it what his payments are
 		uh his uh social security number driver's license any kind of records he may have uh their credit card and the status of their credit
 	
 	
 		what was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff
 	
 	
 		it was just as a demonstration to show
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person
 		and it was mostly it dealt with uh marketing companies these uh direct marketing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		associations that was the primary subject that's how they obtain information about segments of society
 		and group them into age brackets uh their habits their hobbies their income
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and they're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer
 	
 	
 		that's not really good i don't know i guess that's an invasion of privacy i'm not sure that that's an everyday thing though at least not for you know an individual
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		something that i feel is a is a pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now is the open the open office concept
 	
 	
 		the open office
 	
 	
 		uh-huh where they have the you know the little partition dividers throughout a a large room and and people have little cubicles well that's all fine and good but you don't really have any privacy at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody i suppose suppose because it you can easily be overheard overheard
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they get i suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah there's there is
 	
 	
 		and and it's not it's not just that it's uh the whole thing about you know if if you're trying to concentrate well it's rather hard sometimes it's almost impossible to do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because um
 		you know you're uh you're time
 		and you're space is is not your own space
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i've work in a situation like that and i
 		well kind of have a problem with that
 	
 	
 		do you work with uh mixed company male and female or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah is there anybody who doesn't
 	
 	
 		well there there are a few out there
 		it's i suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 		my own environment is open totally there are no cubicles
 		there's nothing to block anything
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so yeah but um i guess we're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of
 		communications that anything can be obtained from anybody's record or
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		the computer is the
 		the big advent of that i believe because it they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button and it appears
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in front of them and you don't have to i i know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's no secret and it shouldn't be that way i don't think
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i don't think that's that's quite right either
 	
 	
 		i mean it's not really government for the people and by the people i'll tell you that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		what do you think could be done about it
 	
 	
 		uh the only way it can change is um
 		if if everybody bands together it's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office
 		the only thing really that can be changed is for us to everybody to say we've had enough of you out you go but
 		uh i don't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that it has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done um
 		i don't know it's it's still a a free i suppose country insofar as we're we're able to
 		obtain information and i wouldn't be for total banning of
 		uh all information or it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned about but it's it's hard to define
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh a lot of those boundaries
 	
 	
 		it really is it's something that something that i've just had a
 		a dealing with is like a credit bureau
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well they take they take my name which is a very common name and my last name is even more common
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they they check that name against uh their list and they find several
 		and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name
 	
 	
 		so you've received a lot of uh flack
 	
 	
 		they don't they don't even check my social security number
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and companies are paying them good money to report accurately and they're not they're so lazy they're just not doing it i mean they just find your name and they match it up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and  that just drives me crazy because they're and then they want then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this
 		write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them you know and then it takes three weeks and all and i'm like baloney
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you messed it up you fix it
 	
 	
 		is that usually what you tell them in the letter
 	
 	
 		no what i've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		like uh uh recently i was reported as having JC Penney accounts and i don't
 		so i called JC Penney and i said uh i just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you're providing to them
 		and they say uh-huh because they really don't want to pay for services that's not being done properly either so then they can call
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the credit bureau and say hey you know we're paying you good money to report this properly and you're not doing your job
 	
 	
 		good idea
 	
 	
 		so that's what i've taken to doing lately and it seems to work pretty well so far
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's good
 		any other problems
 	
 	
 		not that i can think of
 	
 	
 		yeah  i
 		i guess i've just about run out of
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i can probably go on but
 		it's it's uh i'm clouding up right now
 	
 	
 		oh yeah probably better let you get back to work
 	
 	
 		well it's nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		maybe again
 	
 	
 		alrighty bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
