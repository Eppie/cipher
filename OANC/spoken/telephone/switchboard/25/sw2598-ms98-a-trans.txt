 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		do you want to start
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm trying to think what i've seen lately i mean well well we just finished watching uh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on tape you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		did you watch Dances With Wolves did you see the movie
 	
 	
 		yeah we we've seen that yeah
 	
 	
 		did you like it
 	
 	
 		yeah it was great have you seen it
 	
 	
 		i thought it was very well done
 	
 	
 		yeah i um
 	
 	
 		how about Ghost
 	
 	
 		we we saw an we liked it but you know i didn't think it was as good as all the uh hype was about it
 	
 	
 		right i feel the same way about that too it was okay
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i i couldn't see it
 		worth getting a nomination for uh best picture
 	
 	
 		no no and uh what let's see uh the
 		most recent ones that i've seen are those two Ghost and uh Dances With Wolves but i rent uh uh videos do you
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and so we just uh it depends um you know it depends on what
 	
 	
 		you you watch many
 		do you like the classics like uh Gone With the Wind and uh you know the older movies
 	
 	
 		i'd like to see those i keep you know um you know there's like three movies that i i keep telling myself that i should see one of these you know some day that i haven't seen you know that that are classics you know because i've never seen Citizen Kane and never seen
 	
 	
 		yeah that was good
 	
 	
 		i've never seen Casablanca and never seen Gone With The Wind
 	
 	
 		i think i've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies but in in you know a long time ago and uh like the Maltese Falcon and all those uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i i definitely we saw part of The African Queen on on TV a couple of years ago and i've i've always i've been wanting to see all of it but we just you know we walk into the video store and we're like well why don't we go see this now  so
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah that was good yeah
 		yeah yeah it's true
 	
 	
 		but um i think one of the movies we saw recently we saw uh Misery
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't see that one
 	
 	
 		that was good um oh it was great and it you think you know for a Stephen you know it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory but there's only one well there's a couple scenes
 	
 	
 		really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		at at the end there's there is you know some blood and everything and there's one really bad scene where it's i mean there's not blood but it's pretty graphic  but it's um it's a really good movie um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		really is that the one where uh the guy gets captured by that woman okay yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah he's a writer and um she's his biggest fan and she's also
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		a little a little on the nutso side
 	
 	
 		uh-huh did you see Pacific Heights
 	
 	
 		no we haven't um
 	
 	
 		i saw that one that one wasn't that great either well i didn't think so no
 	
 	
 		oh it wasn't
 		okay i i got i heard like mixed reviews um of that we saw
 	
 	
 		how about Silence of the Lambs
 	
 	
 		that's that's on our list of things to see
 	
 	
 		i know i i wanted to see i i was curious if you had seen it and that uh
 	
 	
 		no our big thing is um you know movie movie prices up here i think it's like six bucks now in the theaters and you know so it's like you know a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's us too yeah yeah true i know it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was uh Edward Scissorhands
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah have you seen that oh it was great  yeah it was
 	
 	
 		no
 		really
 		i thought it was kind of maybe for kids more than adults
 	
 	
 		no no it's um
 		it's an odd film and it's really interesting that i like the director a lot um a guy named Tim Burton
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		did you ever see the movie Beetlejuice
 	
 	
 		uh part of it i
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i never really watched the whole thing
 	
 	
 		oh see yeah well if you if you liked Beetlejuice you'll probably like Edward Scissorhands if you didn't like Beetlejuice you'll probably won't like Edward Scissorhands
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah it's um Burton's kind of uh
 		he he he's a very odd odd man but he's i think he's very interesting and uh i liked those two movies of his a lot he did Batman also which you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that was pretty good though really
 	
 	
 		it was good but i mean he was
 		um
 	
 	
 		when you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you see it for uh you know a couple of hours or an hour and it really there's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh
 	
 	
 		and all the different stuff like that you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whose your favorite actress or actor
 	
 	
 		um don't really know i like Costner a lot but uh i'm a big i'm a big baseball fan so you know after Bull Durham and Field of Dreams you know um although you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that was good i saw that movie too that was very good
 	
 	
 		which one
 	
 	
 		Field of Dreams
 	
 	
 		yeah Field of Dreams was good um and i i think i liked the other movies he's done No Way Out was really good and did you ever see Silverado
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 		Silverado uh
 		who who was that with
 	
 	
 		um let's see Danny Glover Scott Glen Kevin Kline um Brian Dennehe Jeff Goldblum's in uh John Clease is in it if you don't blink
 	
 	
 		that the name the the title sounds familiar i'm trying to think
 	
 	
 		it was it was a big western i mean i think Roseanne Arquett was in it too another one that if you blink you'd miss her uh it was and i think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours and and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		um but it was it was really good  um
 	
 	
 		i i might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar
 		although i would i would remember i think in with him in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how about Revenge did you see that with him
 	
 	
 		no i didn't is that any good
 	
 	
 		with uh Anthony Quinn i thought it was i like everything he's done so far
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		you know it's uh one of those movies that it's not a great movie but it was okay
 	
 	
 		yeah we were in the video store today and somebody was recommending it to somebody you know the the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it was not a bad movie
 	
 	
 		huh well i'll have to catch it one of these days you say you you said you seen No Way Out
 	
 	
 		yeah that was excellent
 	
 	
 		yeah that was very good um he was in The Untouchables too
 	
 	
 		now that's another one i wanted to see that in fact that was advertised not too long ago
 	
 	
 		he
 		yeah it was on um it
 	
 	
 		cable
 	
 	
 		no it was on one of the networks i think last weekend
 	
 	
 		okay i know i saw yeah something about it
 	
 	
 		uh or two weeks ago
 		yeah i um i wish i i mean i'd seen it when when you know it was originally in the theaters and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i saw it you know i saw part of it again i mean i like you know i like Costner i like Sean Connery and uh there's this one there's this one actor it's really silly that i enjoy him a lot but i i've really enjoyed him in everything i've seen him in a guy named Charles Martin Smith
 	
 	
 		i don't know him
 	
 	
 		um you've probably seen him and just an you know oh that's who the guy is do you remember did you ever see American Graffiti
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i i don't think so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		did you ever see the movie Star Man
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		okay in Star Man he was the guy chasing after
 		um Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen or Nancy Allen you know with short nerdy guy with glasses he's
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		he's just i i don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in he was in the Untouchables he was the accountant
 	
 	
 		oh oh i know who you mean he was in uh uh Honey Don't Shrink the Kids wasn't he
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no no you're thinking of Rick Moranis
 		he looks like Rick Moranis but he's not
 	
 	
 		oh okay  see all right yeah that's the one i was thinking of
 		but i have i've seen quite a few movies i i enjoy them i think that uh it's it's kind of like uh good entertainment an uh an escape type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how about some of the ads do you go by the ads when you look at them or the reviews do they influence you a lot
 	
 	
 		uh a little of
 		a review usually won't make me go see a movie i hadn't already wanted to see
 	
 	
 		yeah did you see Goodfellas
 	
 	
 		no it's oh uh i want to see it
 	
 	
 		that was that was pretty good um and
 	
 	
 		um we want to see Godfather Part Three also but my my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago but i've never seen either of the first you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of the of the Godfather movies so we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see Godfather Part Three somewhere
 	
 	
 		i was just going to say that you should see those first uh first if you can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if you if you read the book it's uh even better the book was excellent
 	
 	
 		oh okay i haven't
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh i was a little disappointed in the third one it's Godfather Three it was not bad but i expected more i think
 	
 	
 		never read it
 		uh-huh
 		we just rented um a couple weeks ago a movie called The Freshmen with um it's got Matthew Broderick in it and um uh Marlon Brando And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in The Godfather
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		um yeah it's it's one of the reasons why you know The Godfather's been on our minds lately um but uh there's a bunch of scenes from uh
 		uh from The Godfather that's used because Matthew Broderick's going to film school and uh in his classes they're using there's a bunch they're running a bunch of scenes from The Godfather and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing you know this Mafia you know this uh organized crime head
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's um it was it was a fun movie
 	
 	
 		how about Tom Cruise do you like his stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Cocktails or uh
 		what
 	
 	
 		i liked Rainman i thought i thought it was interesting that he was doing something
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that was good i liked Rainman too
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'm being from Baltimore of course i'm a big Barry Levinson fan since uh he he's you know he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um no i don't Barry Levinson did um Diner and Tinman and Avalon which are all set in Baltimore
 	
 	
 		yeah they sound familiar i probably saw parts of those you know a lot of times i'll watch i'll start watching a movie and i'm tired and it next thing you know it's it's especially if there's commercial in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then the titles might sound familiar but i really don't know what they're all about
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		yeah of the three of those Diner's probably the best i mean they're they're all pretty good but Diner is really worth seeing
 	
 	
 		is that the one set in the fifties or sixties
 	
 	
 		uh late fifties yeah
 	
 	
 		late fifties yeah i think i saw that one
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay and uh yeah
 	
 	
 		how about Meryl Streep
