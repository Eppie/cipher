 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there we go
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		well actually i'm a Dodgers i'm a Dodgers fan from way back um
 	
 	
 		oh  how way back i mean
 	
 	
 		like um late fifties early sixties
 	
 	
 		okay so Wally Moon moon shots and all that
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh coliseum Wally Moon and all that okay yeah it's uh um
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		i i'm i'm living in  just west of Baltimore and uh  Frederick um which is also just west of Baltimore has a minor league team and uh
 		and Wally Moon is the manager of them  yeah so he's still kicking around
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		that's interesting
 		yeah i i also lived uh eight years in Ohio before going to uh going away to college
 		and i used to go watch the Toledo Mud Hens
 	
 	
 		oh i saw them i went i i was out there last summer i saw saw a game Ned Skeldon
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		is that the stadium
 	
 	
 		uh i couldn't tell you for sure it's been a long time
 	
 	
 		oh okay so um it used to be a uh race track
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah um it was that was impression i got when i was there so i almost okay
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah so had a lot of fun actually i mean i like minor league baseball a lot it it's cheaper  for one thing
 	
 	
 		yep
 		well that's that's true uh i've become i've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since i've been here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh they've led the American league in batting fielding and pitching but they've never been able to do more than one of those in any any given year so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i uh
 		think they're in in for a odd year this year actually um
 		they um
 		i i don't understand why Incaviglia got released
 	
 	
 		i don't either i mean the guy's twenty twenty five home runs maybe thirty eighty some RBIs
 	
 	
 		i mean he you know he can't field and you know he strikes out a lot but i mean he's done that for five years why get rid of him now
 	
 	
 		really i mean he really has become a a very decent fielder
 	
 	
 		oh he has okay i hadn't
 	
 	
 		yeah he he's he's not a the liability that he was that he used to be
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		oh he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys i mean with uh Detroit you know bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah of course you know get a guy like Cecil Fielder uh you know if if he strikes out a lot so what
 	
 	
 		yeah well is that i mean with Detroit i mean they can get away with one guy like that i mean if i if i were like if i were running Detroit i would start building the team around Fielder
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit all they can do is hit home runs and strike out you know which they did  so
 	
 	
 		right
 		yep
 		well i think the key for for LA this year is whether Orel Hershiser can come back
 	
 	
 		i think their pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter um
 	
 	
 		it may be
 	
 	
 		i uh i like them a lot i i think they're going to go all the way um
 		and and i i mean by saying i like them i like their chances i i actually don't like the Dodgers i'm a Giants fan  from from way back
 	
 	
 		right right well picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt
 	
 	
 		no  Brett Butler didn't hurt either um and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt and  Bobby Ojeda they got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks
 	
 	
 		uh who was the last one
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		um he's uh he's pretty decent pitcher he's
 	
 	
 		yes he is
 	
 	
 		um okay you know who he is then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um  and uh that guy Offerman the short stop is gonna be good
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well it should be an interesting year
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm looking i've  i've already been to one game and in fact i should have been to two but
 	
 	
 		are you you are you an Orioles fan
 	
 	
 		um  the the team i live and die with actually is the Red Sox mostly die uh but um i i go to the Orioles since they're here and i you know i do enjoy them um i was out at opening day on Monday um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		yeah
 		yeah you know i kind of wish that they had interleague play like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the National League teams here once in a while
 	
 	
 		how far is Houston
 	
 	
 		uh three hundred miles
 	
 	
 		ooh okay keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah it is it's it's incredible
 	
 	
 		yeah i um
 		yeah we're we're pretty lucky because if if i wanna see a National League team i can usually go up to Philadelphia
 	
 	
 		there you go
 	
 	
 		and um you know saw you know saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before
 	
 	
 		boy you are a baseball fan aren't you
 	
 	
 		oh  uh yeah
 	
 	
 		interesting
 	
 	
 		um i try to see whatever i can i mean i've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		yeah hoping they'll do it this year because um uh um having a kid
 		this fall so it's like well  well so much for going to lots of baseball games
 	
 	
 		all right
 		yeah so so uh do it while you can
 	
 	
 		yeah seriously
 	
 	
 		sure well it's been good talking with you sure enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		yep good talking with you and uh and uh you know you'll be happy i think in October when the Dodgers win
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't mind
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll be i'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right
 	
 	
 		yeah well God bless and uh good talking with you
