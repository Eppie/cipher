 
     		
 	
 		well do you like to do your yard work
 	
 	
 		yeah this is actually a duplex that we're in so and it's rented
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we're looking into buying a house but um the landlord is supposed to do the yard work although he doesn't do it any frequency every once in a while he comes around so in the meantime we have our own lawn mower and we probably do it a little more than him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but we don't do a whole lot since it's a rental property we've added a few things like around the patio and i've tried to get a few shrubs to grow around here but
 		since it's you know rental we haven't spent a whole lot of time and effort in trying to do landscaping we just kind of maintain what's here and mow the grass and trim and that kind of stuff when it's needed
 	
 	
 		oh great what kind of lawn do you have
 	
 	
 		you mean the type of grass um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what kind of a grass we have  oh Saint Augustine yeah it's Bermuda in the back it's the kind that has those you know grows sideways yeah that stuff
 	
 	
 		oh
 		it grows in runners right right
 		i just love that in the middle of the summer when that gets real thick that's so nice to walk on isn't it
 	
 	
 		well the problem has been in the winter of um
 	
 	
 		yeah two winters ago
 	
 	
 		eight nine yeah a lot of it got zapped and it's it's slow coming back like our landlord didn't really replant any last year a lot of front lawn look looks pretty bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he didn't redo anything so it's it's coming back a little bit now this year
 	
 	
 		well you know you know mine did and it was late at this time last year i held out no hope for it but i watered and fertilized the hell out of it and i by July and August it was as strong and thick as it had ever been
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh and of course this year it never really died out that much i mean this year here it is only April and it's looking good yeah we had we had a mild winter we you know everybody in my neighborhood hires their yard work done and i think i think the fun of owning a house is doing the yard work
 	
 	
 		it was very mild mild winter yeah
 	
 	
 		and i mean i thought so i've owned a house for um twenty five of the of the thirty two years that i've been here in Dallas and i just enjoy it so much and uh and and particularly the lawn i love it dark i love to see it get a deep dark green
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i love to uh i i love to mow it i don't like weeding the flower beds around the house and my son's supposed to do that but pretty every once and a while they get ahead of him  so i end up doing that for him and and my wife sometimes takes care of the flowers
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and so between us we got all our own little things to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we got we got two girls off in college they don't do anything but uh i uh and i love to be out in the summertime i love to be out when the sun is really nice and hot and just go out there and sweat a bit mowing the lawn
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just love it in fact i uh mow my lawn but there's a gigantic vacant field in back of us uh that belongs to Richland College
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and everybody that we have that backs up to it mows about uh oh maybe ten or fifteen or twenty yards into the vacant lot to keep weeds from growing and coming over and seeding in your yard
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so so we all even get more uh get more lawn to mow that way but uh it's fun
 	
 	
 		do you back up to it on the south side or the east side
 	
 	
 		uh i am on the east side of Richland in fact so Richland's on my west side when i look out my back door to see the sun set i look across the Richland field
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		okay and
 	
 	
 		because we had one of our uh a person similar similar stature to uh Gahouli from the legal department Mel Sharp he lives around in that area too he lives on Whiteman Place i think
 	
 	
 		okay i i live on Wharton Drive
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and Wharton intersects uh uh it dead ends into Chimney Hill
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah okay
 	
 	
 		and then it it dead ends just dead ends up here where i live  it runs uh it runs north and south from Chimney Hill north
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh anyway i love to do that and the other thing that i love is that i am a distance runner by hobby
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and some nights i'll come home from work like i did last night and with rain in the forecast and the lawn was getting pretty high i said i got to mow the lawn but i want to go out and run now which do i do first
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i'm sitting around thinking well if i go out and run now because i messed around until almost seven uh six thirty or so if i go out and run now
 		i'm going to get back and i'm going to be mowing the lawn and it's going to get dark and i'm going to have to guess where where the line is to mow
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so if i mow now then i'll go out and run afterwards and what the mowing does it limbers you up
 		so that you go out and have a good run i finished up right at about dark and then i went out and ran four and a half miles and it was great just because the mowing it i i don't i didn't i don't have to do any stretching before running if i've been pushing the lawn mower around for an hour for an hour and ten minutes or so
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so that's just you know i just i i i just really enjoy it and i hate to here see people gripe and moan about doing uh yard work what about trees do you have any trees around
 	
 	
 		we got a couple of big trees out front um i guess right along our street there used to be one of the um lines i guess there was fields here many many years ago cotton fields or something and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you bet and i remember that
 	
 	
 		yeah well we have a lot of trees that that go across our front yards that are very old that must have been like where the line was in between the fields so we have couple of huge trees out front that's pretty nice no trees really in the back
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		where the fence was or something yeah yeah
 		how how how long have you live there Maureen
 	
 	
 		almost two years
 	
 	
 		oh do you have children oh okay
 	
 	
 		no not yet we've only been married two years
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay because you've got a a excellent elementary school over there uh our middle daughter went over there one year while ours was being built here and uh Richland Park is just a super neat school
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they got a lot of neat programs the uh uh how often do you when when the when the uh growing season's good how often do you have to mow your lawn
 	
 	
 		uh nearly every week
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i got i got so carried away with water and fertilizer last year in uh June July and the first part of August i was mowing every four days  and i talked to my parents i'm from Massachusetts originally
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i talked to my parents on the phone i said you know we Texans are a funny breed we we water we water we spend
 		hundreds of dollars a month during the dry part of July August watering our lawn we go out and spend thirty or forty dollars a whack on fertilizer and then we bitch and gripe about having to mow it so often
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we said because we Massachusetters weren't like that we never did anything to it except mow it and and it always looked nice
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right we never did this watering stuff everybody waters
 	
 	
 		yeah we didn't do all that stuff here but they get more natural rain than we do you know we get so much rain in the spring and then we go sometimes entire June July and August without any so i guess we're where are you from originally
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh Philadelphia area
 	
 	
 		oh okay so you've been in Texas how long
 	
 	
 		eight years
 	
 	
 		oh well you're you're almost a Texan i've been here thirty two years
 	
 	
 		that's a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah thirty two years and my wife's a Texan so of course naturally my children but they still think i'm a Yankee
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and i was never called that until i came here
 	
 	
 		yeah isn't that funny i wasn't either i have uh
 	
 	
 		and i i was just taken aback by that
 	
 	
 		yeah when i got here my uh uh best friend who was my office mate when i first got here in nineteen fifty nine said the only Yankees he could ever stand wore pinstripes suits and played baseball
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but but people weren't as mobile then as they are now i mean i will bet half of your neighborhood or three quarters of it and i know it's true with ours is not from Dallas is not even from Texas
 	
 	
 		well i keep reminding these people that it's good thing we came down here and got some changes made like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		shopping on Sunday i said it's a little hard to do everything on Saturday no pass no play uh kind of thing i said you know we had that for years in Ohio and Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		yeah huh
 		
 
 		yeah
 		uh i yeah that's true that's true we did we did and uh do you all do you all uh do you all have to water a lot over there
 	
 	
 		uh pretty much and our landlord always asks us to uh continue doing that even though we pay for the water because of you know foundation problems around here
 	
 	
 		oh yeah because of the foundation problem you know that's an interesting thing i've had two overseas assignments with TI uh i was in uh Malaysia eighty one eighty two eighty three and eighty four and i was in the Philippines eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and i had two different tenants
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my first one kept the inside of the house nice this is a two story five bedroom and uh uh they only lived in the downstairs because he was divorced and had two children and they only visited him one weekend a month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		and that was the only time the upstairs was so the upstairs looked as new as we left uh they only lived downstairs uh and and his wife was an interior decorator and the house was just kept
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		very nice you know i've i've heard horror stories from other TIers that have had tenants but he didn't like yard work and what happened was the Saint Augustine grew up you know if you don't watch it and keep it trimmed back it will totally take over your flower beds
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		well when we came back what used to be our flower beds were solid Saint Augustine  we had to we had to dig it out  and the second tenant when we went to the Philippines the second tenant he had two little girls
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so they lived throughout the entire house he also had a dog in the house that i didn't know about and so our carpeting was in bad shape when i got back but uh my yard was immaculate he did a great job on the yard so you so i guess you can't have everything
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but but you're right and i guess that's very important because of this black earth with have here that cracks terribly uh and it shifts badly in the summertime that uh if you don't water around the foundation you're going to lose it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and boy i'll tell you you've really got to have a conscientious tenant and it's hard for him to be conscientious when he's thinking of paying a hundred dollar water bill uh every uh uh i you know every month when you get into the June July and August time period
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and how how big is your duplex
 	
 	
 		um each side has three bedrooms and two baths living room and then a big uh kitchen that has uh dining area in it
 	
 	
 		oh okay they're they're fairly big
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so each side is like seventeen hundred square feet
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well where uh where did you go to school
 	
 	
 		uh Ohio State
 	
 	
 		oh you went to Ohio State oh you're uh up in the Woody Hays country huh
 	
 	
 		right and i was i was going to school in his prime back when we had Archie Griffin and we were winning all the Heisman trophies and going to Rose Bowl that was when i was going to school there
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah yeah
 		yeah we were really excited about the we're
