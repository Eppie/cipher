 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well what's your thoughts on it
 	
 	
 		okay i i think what happened with savings and loans is uh is what everyone says is they they made a lot of uh
 		of not well secured loans on real estate and when uh the bottom fell out of the real estate market the bottom fell out of their loans
 	
 	
 		um that's it that's that's the primary that and the loosening of the restrictions letting them ease up on their cash reserves and uh like you say all these bad real estate loans and energy loans
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um you know i i it's hard to say what caused it i mean you know if if the regulations hadn't been uh
 		hadn't been relaxed maybe it wouldn't have happened but i somehow think it still would have
 		you go in you start making massive investments in those two areas and you're you're just playing the market you know they were just gambling with their their savers' money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		then of course then of course there was the fraud but you're going to have that anywhere so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think
 		right  yeah that seemed to play a pretty big role i think because i don't know i get the feeling that the regulations probably needed to be a little a little more stringent
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well so are they are they handling it right
 		gee who knows
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i don't don't even know if they know
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah it certainly has has uh the magnitude of the crisis it seems
 		i don't know it it seems much greater than i would have thought it really just seems out of proportion talking they're talking four or five hundred billion dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i that that's the part of it i couldn't understand i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i wonder if there's not a little bit of overzealousness there uh you know they say well this one went under because of bad energy loans bad real estate loans and then they go around classifying everybody as bad when in fact there are some very good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		loans out there i mean not all real estate loans are bad you know the greatest majority of them are people who own their homes so you know those aren't exactly what you'd call bad  i
 	
 	
 		right no i think that a a typically bad loan is is that the ones that just took place massively in Houston when they put up these huge office buildings and spent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah that exactly
 	
 	
 		very large amounts of money and then could simply simply could not rent them out they couldn't even rent them out for expenses it was cheaper to keep them empty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah the
 	
 	
 		than to rent them at twenty percent occupancy
 	
 	
 		yeah and and that's nothing more than speculation i mean they they
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it it seems that there should have been something in the regulations saying they couldn't do that i know banks can't do it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh back when i used to play the commodities market i i tried to go to the bank to get a loan to buy gold and silver futures and they wouldn't let me
 	
 	
 		well i mean just for me to mortgage my
 		to to get a mortgage on my house i mean they invest investigated me personally to the point where i was insulted and i was putting forty thousand dollars down on a hundred and sixty thousand dollar house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i would have thought gosh we're happy to do it just sign here you know but
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i mean they had forty thousand dollars in equity and i mean they just wanted to see three years of income tax returns and all that bullshit which really sort of disturbed me
 	
 	
 		and the and
 		and then it
 		yeah
 		yeah and then and then some some rich yo-yo walks in there who's buddies with the bank president saying look i want to borrow
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		seven hundred thousand dollars so i can invest in this oil well they say oh sure no problem you're a good customer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i uh i run i run a little business on the side out of my home and i tried to uh get set up with my bank to accept MasterCard and Visa
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you would think i was asking for an appointment with the president you know and basically what it came down to is they weren't going to let me have it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		um they frown on home business they uh they they insist that you have a storefront
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and that's just ludicrous i mean i mean the way things are going people are more and more working out of their homes i know a lot of people who do lawyers doctors uh architects consultants
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they they work in their home there's no reason for them to have an office they they have very little customer contact and when they do they go to the customer
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i mean  you know what's the story on them you know are you going to let them have it well of course they're going to get it you know all you've got to do is have a nice big bank account balance and they'll give it to you
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh i also run a little business out of my home on the side what's the nature of yours
 	
 	
 		uh mail order primarily
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		me and my uh me and my roomie who's also my partner um
 		well we lump everything under this business i mean we do just about everything he's into the computer end of things he does consulting and graphics design and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh systems design i mean you name it he does that and then i handle the mail order and whatever else we do we do cat breeding  i mean yeah it's all lumped under the business
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah cat breeding huh uh
 	
 	
 		um yeah  make a few bucks here and there on that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um we're we're there's several ways of getting set up to take MasterCard and Visa uh there's several banks out there the smaller banks who are trying to break into the market
 		and they will take the risk on a home business um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's i made i made a few contacts through CompuServe um talking about you know hey we're brokers for these banks you know it you don't pay us anything the bank pays us and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of course what you're dealing with is some somewhat higher costs
 		like a two hundred and fifty dollar nonrefundable application fee
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh wow
 	
 	
 		so if the bank turns you down well that's it you're out two hundred and fifty bucks
 	
 	
 		that's not too great
 	
 	
 		no i i'm i'm i'm leery of it i know that's the way it works um
 		but and as long as you can meet their requirements there there's very little chance they'll turn you down and they do have some requirements like you have to be registered with the State and you have to have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a business address and you have to have a business phone line and then you have to have a separate line for their equipment that kind of stuff uh but if meet all those chances are they'll approve you so we're looking at that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we're looking at that it's just it's just hard to give somebody two hundred and fifty bucks on a chance you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i would i would find that uh a little bit disarming
 	
 	
 		yeah what what business do you do
 	
 	
 		it's a computer business
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah my uh my roomie is down in Charlotte right now he's got an internship down at IBM
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so business has sort of come to a standstill
 	
 	
 		i see where does does he go to school here
 	
 	
 		yeah he's at uh he's at NC State
 	
 	
 		i see okay what's what's his name i might know him
 	
 	
 		uh Floro Chrisostimo
 	
 	
 		uh-huh okay i guess i don't
 	
 	
 		do you by are you by any chance out at the campus
 	
 	
 		uh no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay because the last guy i talked to was out on the campus
 	
 	
 		i see ha
 	
 	
 		it was how did how did you get involved in this
 	
 	
 		um i've got a a friend who's in the business who just gave me this application
 	
 	
 		yeah he he picked this thing up from school and brought it home and i said yeah sure i'll do it why not
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and he signed up for it and then of course he moved off to Charlotte so now i'm stuck making his calls too
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		
 
 		gosh i don't know what i got roped into
 	
 	
 		ha
 		so uh oh well whatever it's five bucks a shot what the heck
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah what the heck i'm surely not going to count this as business income
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah um really well speaking of that i think we've probably given them their money's worth
 	
 	
 		oh yeah no doubt about it i i usually go until the the recording comes on
 	
 	
 		oh i see i've never gone that long that's
 	
 	
 		have you yeah that it it'll cut you in about ten minutes
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		uh they used to it used to say you have exceeded the ten minute recording limit but now they just say uh we're sorry our recording capacity is limited today you know a nicer way of saying you talked too long
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but anyway if you need to get going we'll we'll terminate
 		okay
 		well good talking to you
 		maybe we'll maybe we'll chat again
 	
 	
 		all right bye-bye
 	
 	
 		all right later on man bye bye
