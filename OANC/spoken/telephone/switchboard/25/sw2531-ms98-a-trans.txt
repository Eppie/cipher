 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what are your feelings on crime and what can be done about it
 		i'd be interested in hearing since you are a prison guard
 	
 	
 		the problem goes all the way back to the entire criminal justice system needs to be reworked
 	
 	
 		boy that's for sure i agree there
 	
 	
 		no longer do we have a point where the crime fits the punishment we've got guys now with in Texas anyway is what i'm talking about
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with the situation we've got with prison overcrowding and everything a man gets a fifteen year sentence they're averaging serving one month for every year assessed
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's not
 		the punishment is not fitting the crime now
 	
 	
 		no that's for sure
 		i mean it's it's kind of sad when you have to give them more than one life sentence in order to insure that they're going to stay in for a while i mean you know
 		even that's what
 	
 	
 		i even gone have gone to the point where i don't believe in giving them a life sentence if you have to do that you might as well shoot them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it costs twenty five thousand dollars per inmate per year just to keep them locked up that doesn't count any medical or dental health they get
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		a bullet costs twenty five cents you tell me which one's more cost effective
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah and who's paying for it  certainly not the people that are in there the the victims in in a in the sense are paying for it
 	
 	
 		the victims and and the citizens of Texas
 	
 	
 		right
 		right no yeah they do need to to drastically do something uh about the whole works because uh it's obvious especially with the introduction of drugs now that crime is is there's
 		it's in such the uprise i mean there's so much more of it now than there was even fifteen years ago
 	
 	
 		as long as you've got the problem
 		a big part of the problem anyway take a look at most of your politicians that are in now ninety percent of them
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		are practicing lawyers
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		as long as you got practicing lawyers in politics
 		they're going to rig the laws to where they know they're never going to run out of business
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		as far as hard line laws dealing with criminals we don't have them in this country anymore we have situation ethics
 	
 	
 		oh i believe that i do
 	
 	
 		john Q Citizen goes up
 		robs the liquor store shoots the guy behind the counter
 		his his uh lawyer is going to argue that well my client was under the influence of whatever drug he was on at the time and he wasn't really in his normal frame frame of mind
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well apparently he had enough snapping to where he got it whatever weapon he used and he was coherent enough to tell the guy give me the money or i'm going to kill you
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if he if he had enough snap to do that he knew what he was doing the penalty assessed is death period
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i
 	
 	
 		that's too simple
 	
 	
 		i yeah i know uh that is too simple well people keep saying well what if they you know but uh they're uh look at how long people sit on death row
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		before they even do i mean they've been assigned the death penalty and they don't even do it you know
 	
 	
 		well that's that's one of my biggest screams about the entire death penalty goes for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in this country they just appeal it and appeal it and appeal it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if a person has done a crime so bad that the jury gives them the death penalty
 		now the Supreme Court says we've got to give them one appeal okay i agree give them one appeal when that appeal fails within thirty days execution of sentence
 	
 	
 		okay one right but that's all
 		yes look i mean that has to be one of the biggest wasters of money is the years that these guys sit on death row i mean
 	
 	
 		i think that you know of the the uh
 		he run across a man's file that was like on death row for nine years before they finally got around to executing him
 	
 	
 		oh no i mean look at them
 	
 	
 		i think you keeping him on death row for nine years was cruel and unusual torture
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they're you know they say that they can't uh inflict cruel cruel and unusual punishment but boy what is that knowing that any day the shoe could drop i mean yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's it
 	
 	
 		i mean nine years that's incredible oh i don't know what the average is uh uh for
 	
 	
 		eight
 	
 	
 		eight is the average wow
 	
 	
 		is the average because they'll appeal it for that many times
 	
 	
 		hum-um it should be never it should that should have a cutoff time just like uh uh statutes of limits and everything all that other stuff you know they they should have like within one year
 		so that they'd have enough time for an appeal and uh you know get that stuff out of the way and if it's turned down the the you know after that if if two people have said it then two is enough
 		
 
 		they shouldn't even allow the lawyers to go any further
 		i think they're kind of bending the law just they just want more money is what it is i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		they want the money so they're going to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they will twist it and bend it
 	
 	
 		well uh that's kind of obvious i mean they're even carrying it to to where now uh that they advertise on TV you know
 		if your if you uh you know have done this or if you need this uh uh we'll sue for you and you don't have to pay us unless you but then what they don't tell you is that if you if they win you give them at least a third of the of the thing that they win
 		so  i don't know it is uh it's getting to be more business now rather than uh actually uh dealing with the crime than with uh um
 		the uh punishment they the the lawyers are just in it for the money  i'm i'm convinced i know i i agree with you i think you're real you're very right that the politicians should i think they should
 		have an equal amount of you know maybe they can have a few but i think most of them should be not uh lawyers in the fact and that's way way they've gotten into politics it's because of the the law things you know the loops and everything
 		but uh
 		but no i know we it um we're in Maryland and uh we have the same thing overcrowding and and uh they are letting them out i mean just the regular jail sentence thing they let them out because of they don't have any place to keep to put them
 		so somebody that could you know uh unless uh been a major offense but uh uh even the piddly little stuff i mean the the guys that loses today in America is the victim
 		and whoever that may be whether it's a robbery or drugs or whatever else um
 		they are the ones that are going to pay and they are the one that are going to suffer
 		and the other person you know if they pay if they if they
 		uh arrest them uh and uh then the you know time the law takes over uh half the time uh they either let them go or they get off with a a sentence because they've had a lawyer that
 		you know feels that
 		that they weren't all together when they did it
 	
 	
 		things are going to come to a point it's going to probably
 		get to such an extent where the average American citizen if they see a crime go down or a crime is happening against them they're not going to worry about trying to get a policeman they're not going to worry about it because they're going to be packing their own heat and they're going to take care of business themselves
 	
 	
 		right although you know uh  that uh it's kind of a catch twenty two because if you defend yourself or as there was a case where this
 		fellow in Baltimore kept having his store broken into uh through a vent in the ceiling in the ceiling u h the roof so he put an electric grate there well somebody tried to break in
 		got stuck and was electrocuted and he was being sued
 		because this guy was breaking into his store he got electrocuted and was killed coming into his store
 	
 	
 		that's where if you had judges that had any backbone whatsoever they'd have thrown that out before it even got
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right you know now here's the innocent guy that's just trying to keep in business you know he had tried dogs he tried security people he tried you know several other things the dogs like they would just kill the dogs you know so uh it's
 		it's it's wrong your right  um i
 		it it seems unfortunate and a little frustrating because it seems like we have citizens the there isn't mu ch we can do um you try to hope that uh you know
 		your senators and your representatives and uh are going to represent what the people want but uh uh they certainly
 		i'm not sure which way to take to shake up the system bad enough to start making some reforms sure would be nice to see it happening soon
 		because it's obvious that uh pretty soon they're not going to be able to handle you know all of the crime that there is
 		so  i don't know
 		uh
 		it must be especially frustrating to you having do you work there now or is was this uh uh was this before
 	
 	
 		i work there now
 	
 	
 		oh okay so it's just another job uh it must be especially frustrating because even your rights in there  are
 	
 	
 		when i walk through this is what's bad when i walk through the front gate
 		the inmates have more rights than i do
 	
 	
 		yeah and boy does that stink uh that's the same way here uh
 		and they have more freedom i mean i understand that i mean i'm not i mean you can't be everywhere all the time and i'm sure that they have searches and everything but i mean
 		the weapons that they make or that they get and the i mean
 		to me it'd be like walking around in a time bomb all the time even just being there you know just working there um
 		because you never know if you're going to get knifed or something uh you know as a guard that it must be scary  uh
 		and yet
 	
 	
 		some days it is
 	
 	
 		yeah well they and yet did they can they do anything to them when they're in prison i mean surely they can
 		put them in solitary or something i mean  or is that just mythical
 	
 	
 		uh you can put a there's um any number of things you can do
 		aside from locking up in solitaire you can reduce their class in good time have them sent to
 		a harder prison than what they're already locked up into they've got the different security class you've got your minimum in minimum out you've got your medium and then
 	
 	
 		oh okay i didn't know that
