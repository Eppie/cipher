 		uh well lets see i suppose i could say i enjoy joy crocheting
 		um
 		gardening knitting
 		uh
 		hiking
 	
 	
 		do you have a lot of spare time to do it in or is it something you kind of have to make time for
 	
 	
 		well it seems like i don't have time for them but i'm i don't work full-time or anything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i sell Avon and Stanley products
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it's that's not
 		you know the same as an eight hour job
 	
 	
 		well it can't from what i've heard understood it can  can be
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's up to the person
 	
 	
 		sometimes
 		yeah well i i enjoy needlepoint although boy i guess i got myself burned out i did too much too fast and
 	
 	
 		uh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for some reason my eyes aren't quite what they used to be either
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		you sound young
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i am but i i don't know it's just
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		maybe it's the light but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i enjoy photography as a hobby
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		and boating and horseback riding although i'm recovering from back surgery so it's going to be awhile before i can do either one of those
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and bowling and right now my biggest hobby i guess since um you know recovering is
 		watching television and playing Nintendo with my son
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that could be a little boring sometimes i guess too but
 	
 	
 		and i do enjoy reading
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i do read a lot read quite a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i enjoy reading different types of things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i enjoy reading novels
 		then uh you know
 		more serious stuff
 	
 	
 		how how old is your little
 		boy
 	
 	
 		today is his birthday yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh is it really
 		oh how old
 	
 	
 		
 
 		six
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 		my baby's expecting her first baby this month say yes
 	
 	
 		oh really oh how exciting  that could it's always
 	
 	
 		so our children our children are all grown up
 	
 	
 		do they live close by
 	
 	
 		just one of them
 	
 	
 		the one that's going to have the baby well that's good you that will be your new hobby then  taking care of grandbaby
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um my sister's going to have a baby this summer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so but i guess that's a little off the subject
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know i've tried various things i've tried to get interested in things like refinishing furniture woodworking or um ceramics but it just seems like
 		it's so expensive to break into something new
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that um you know with my i've got quite enough of an investment in my photography equipment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that
 	
 	
 		we we had for a while done uh well we still do a lot of picture taking in that and uh we're in the process of putting our eight millimeter
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh films and now the kids and i were going to put them on video
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and we're we're in the process of doing that right now and
 	
 	
 		are you doing that yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how do you do it
 	
 	
 		uh we bought the equipment
 		uh that you do it with
 	
 	
 		you don't have to
 		i mean is the something that you don't have to see it as you it's not like your
 	
 	
 		well the you buy this little little piece of equipment and you use your video camera of course and uh your projector
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh okay that's what i wondered
 	
 	
 		and the combination you the way you connect you know connect them up
 	
 	
 		do they make good quality copies do you think
 	
 	
 		uh i think it's going to we were a little worried there was a lot of background noise on it but uh
 		we can hook it into our uh stereo system after we get the pictures all done
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we can hook it into our uh a video or uh stereo system and uh put music
 		to the film and that will cut out all the background the noise of the uh recorder running and that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		well that's nice
 	
 	
 		because the projector made a lot makes a lot of noise
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember those we've never had one my parents never had one but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh so that's been kind and our darkroom is very we have a darkroom but it's very dusty
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's my dream i guess is to have my own darkroom
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we we're real active in it for a long time but you know you get busy and
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		the kids grow up and
 	
 	
 		they're expensive to maintain just the chemicals are expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we mainly just did a bit of black and white it's
 	
 	
 		yeah i would still like black and white
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to me black and white is photography color is more snapshot
 	
 	
 		oh you can really get some good really good pictures in black and white
 	
 	
 		yeah you really can people don't realize that
 	
 	
 		that
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		not realize that black and white it nowadays it's actually more expensive than uh color
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it's hard to even find film or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		and i well i used to i learned how to knit when i was little my grandmother knitted a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she knitted all the time
 	
 	
 		did she
 	
 	
 		and uh before she passed away and made some beautiful things but i've never really learned how to do more than the basic
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		yeah
 		yeah i don't do a whole it uh time seems to be hard to find for anything you want to do i don't know why
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you
 	
 	
 		yeah i know
 	
 	
 		you'd think i'd have a lot of time but
 	
 	
 		yeah you'd think i would too but you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but i i i'm knitting an afghan for the baby and i haven't worked on this for several weeks  i just haven't got back to it
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 		when's the baby due
 	
 	
 		the twenty ninth
 	
 	
 		
 
 		time to get busy do you know if it's going to be a boy or a girl
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		they don't really care what they have
 	
 	
 		is it her first one
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they didn't want to know  so uh
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		but but i do enjoy it i i i enjoy painting some too but i
 		i really really have trouble finding time i did did some toll painting for a while and i started doing a still life and it's it never got finished
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's something i've
 		it's interesting to me people who watch people who are that know how to paint i just felt like that's something i've never been very good at or very good at drawing or anything
 	
 	
 		well had have you watched any of these things on TV these large brush
 	
 	
 		i've watched uh i've yeah here and there but they make it look uh i i know that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know they just make it look so easy but i know it i'm smart enough to know that it's not quite that easy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well once you start it apparently it's not bad some of the girls have gone into the call age group Claritin University is just not too far from here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they've gone in and uh done a class on the large brush and actually did the painting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know they've never done anything
 		and they come out pretty nice
 	
 	
 		yeah i've yeah and i know a girl that used to do it and hers did too but i just don't think see myself whipping out masterpieces in thirty minutes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like they do on the shows
 		
 
 		do you enjoy cooking
 	
 	
 		yeah i like to cook
 	
 	
 		i like to cook but i've really gotten away from it it's with just two my son and myself it's just not
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't do a lot of fancy cooking
 	
 	
 		to me it's just
 		he you know i hate you know hate to admit this but we live on frozen food
 	
 	
 		well it depends on what it is uh you know well now we i we garden have a small garden and i can i do canning
 	
 	
 		yeah they have
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i like gardening that's of course that's something i can't do with my back

 		and uh my back
 	
 	
 		that's too bad was it lower back or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my dad's grew up on a farm and he always had gardens and we always had fresh vegetables which i just really like and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
