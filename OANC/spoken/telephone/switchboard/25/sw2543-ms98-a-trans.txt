 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay what kind of music do you like
 	
 	
 		well i um several years ago a radio broke in my car and i never i got out of the habit of listening to the radio and so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i haven't been listening i i used to just listen to the rock stations but um  lately i have been going back to classical music i don't really know what
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they're in the the news or something but um so i tend to listen to some of the older
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		songs that were popular back when i was paying attention and then i like some classical music and some of the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		pieces that have been around a while i haven't paid much attention to most of the current music what about you
 	
 	
 		um i listen i listen to a wide variety of music sometimes i'll turn on the classical music sometimes i'll listen to jazz uh every now and then country and western um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'll listen to some of the rock stations i also like the uh the the classic rock stations that play the older more mellow type
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		rock music um some of the some of the rock stations now are the i guess the top forty stations or whatever they just it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating and uh it gets kind of old and they play the same songs over and over and i just get kind of tired of all that
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so lots of times i'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio actually but uh most of my cassettes i guess i don't i don't like hard rock
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		um i have some some rock and some jazz and couple of maybe one or two country and western some uh
 		oh i can't believe i can't think of his name um Garth Brooks i have a couple of his tapes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it's mainly it's mainly just the the light rock type stuff
 	
 	
 		yes i don't i never liked any of the heavy metal music  i never really listened to it because i you know i prefer to have more i guess an established pattern of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		music to listen to but and i back a long time ago when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty and i listened to some of it but i you know now that there's just a million rap groups and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh they try to tend to try to do outdo each other with raciness i think and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so i you know i'm not attracted to that at all but um it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was a easy access and so now that i do have one i just don't automatically turn it on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		unless there's something i'm particularly listening to but you know if you go two or three years without having that what i got the most exposure to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it really changed my lifestyle and kept me from
 		just having a you know easy access to current music and so i did like i say tend to go back to
 		albums and cassettes and things that i had already had purchased but we don't have a CD yet do you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		no i don't
 		i sure don't because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like gosh i have to go out and buy a CD player and then start collecting CDs and it just i haven't gotten around to doing it yet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i i kind of decided to wait until it it was around a while it was kind of like remember when personal calculators first came out and they were really really expensive and then now you can get one for two or three dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		just like VCRs too  yeah i thought of that too that if i wait it'll get a lot less expensive and i can do without it for a while
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		sure and also they get better quality with and they learn to have more features and things and without and making them less expensive so we're kind of waiting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to like uh now you know and the price of cassettes has gone down because CDs are so popular so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's and a CD is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was too right now i think
 	
 	
 		i haven't even priced them i guess they must be
 	
 	
 		they're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece
 	
 	
 		oh really that is awful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i bought some at Christmas time for friends of mine that have CD players i thought my gosh now i know another reason why i'm not going to get a CD player for a while
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		take our time well i can't imagine um you can't record on them and so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they won't be as functional as like a cassette player where if you heard something
 		you could record it you know uh if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something that you'd heard or that you owned an album of so CDs won't be nearly as handy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		yeah see i've got a on my stereo i've got a a uh turntable and then i've got a dual cassette so i can record off other cassettes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i never realized you couldn't record onto CD i just never really thought about it because i haven't really looked into it very much i don't have one and and i've never really looked at one very closely but that that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette player in my car now i guess
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know one of these days when i get a new car maybe i guess all of them probably will have CDs players by then but uh i'm not planning on doing that for a while i just got mine paid off so i'm going to stick with the cassettes and and uh you know until
 	
 	
 		yes  enjoy it
 	
 	
 		until they now my sister my younger sister has a she does have a CD player that she got for Christmas and she's got the the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto CDs i mean i'm sorry other way around off CDs onto cassettes um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		so i can record some things from her and you know get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um i just haven't gone to CD yet
 	
 	
 		why we haven't either but we you know we like the
 		the idea of having great um extra quality you know in your music and things but but i'm satisfied to just have what i've been used to not have to think about the great financial
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sacrifice that that would be to suddenly try to switch over to all CDs or something but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when we had children um i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching and what kind of music i was listening to and activities because um you know i just didn't want them to be exposed to
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a lot of things and a lot of the lot of the songs have some lyrics that um i just wasn't pleased with you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  and they get worse and worse too
 	
 	
 		um-hum and so i really think we've tried to tone down
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		our taste there to make uh you know our children not be exposed to so many negative negative things so early in life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's amazing how i used to when i was in college i used to have the stereo on all the time or i had on MTV or something but ever since i've been out of college
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess over the last several years
 		i listen to the stereo less and less now i will turn on i've got a small jam box in my bathroom i'll turn that on while i'm in the shower and while i'm getting ready because there's really not much else i can do and it's kind of boring standing there putting on makeup so i'll turn the radio on and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then i listen to it when i'm in the car driving to work because again there's you know there's nothing else going on i might as well listen to the radio while i'm driving to work but other than that i've i really don't
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore i guess i'm just too busy doing other things that it's
 		too much trouble to get up and go decide what i want to listen to and put it on the on the turntable i don't know i just don't don't bother to do it very much anymore
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i know what you mean i i know my husband he um
 		plays an instrument and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music and he goes out of his way to play marching band music or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		like you say jazz or classical to the children to to give them some exposure to different kinds of music and i think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's good what instrument does he play
 	
 	
 		he plays the it's a euphonium it's like a small
 		a really small not a tuba but
 		i think it's hard to explain  i never had known anyone to play one before but it's kind of like a small small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh i've never heard of that
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it's a cross between a tuba and and an and you know a horn it's a brass instrument
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so he plays that and and a little bit of piano and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he has some real fond memories of marching band and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		concert band type
 		activities and he thinks that'd be good for the kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is i was exposed to a lot of music when i was younger i my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
  
 		so i was i was a real good piano player but then i got interested in a lot of other things and i got real involved in many things and
 		and now i don't have a piano in my apartment or anything i could sit back down and play a few things but not like i used to be able to it's kind of sad that i've let that slip away
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i took guitar lessons i think for one or two years and uh
 		that was about the same time i was taking piano and then i got too busy in high school to really keep up with it between homework
