 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what kind of car do you drive now
 	
 	
 		i drive a Honda Prelude and
 	
 	
 		do you i drive a Honda Accord
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i bought mine a year ago so i'm not buying a car any time soon
 	
 	
 		yeah me either i just bought mine uh it'll be a year in August
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i love it though i love Hondas
 	
 	
 		yeah it
 	
 	
 		i think i found my car
 	
 	
 		well i i like where all the controls are
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they're they're in good spots and i i have an automatic i can't drive a standard
 	
 	
 		oh really i have a standard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but um i it's and it's
 		supposedly real reliable the only thing i've ever heard about Hondas is that the breaks go out first yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really i hadn't heard that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what did you have before you bought that
 	
 	
 		i had a Buick Regal
 	
 	
 		did you
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i had uh Mazda RX seven before that and that was the worse car i've ever driven in my life
 	
 	
 		the Buick was was great it was nine years old and and it was still going strong the only
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		problems i had had with it in nine years that i owned it i had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and
 		that was the only major problem that i had i mean i had little piddly things like i had to replace the muffler and i had replaced the tires and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh seems like it had a radiator leak once but i never had any major anything other than the compressor
 	
 	
 		right
 		i never really had anything major with my Mazda but it was a standard also and the clutch went out on it toward the end i had it five years
 		and the last year or last two years it seemed to go out really easily i think it went out twice in two years
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that's that's a lot it shouldn't go out that much
 	
 	
 		no hm
 	
 	
 		and so i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the Honda but i don't think i'm going to do that again i think i'm going back to automatic now
 	
 	
 		well i never well well i kind of know how to drive standard but i've never owned one so i hadn't i don't drive one a lot so i don't feel feel comfortable in traffic with it
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and for everything i've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and resale value is really important to me
 	
 	
 		yeah it is me too that's why i got the Honda Hondas have great resale value
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the Mazda definitely did not  not at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they're worse than American cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes
 	
 	
 		really
 		i did pretty well with my uh Regal because it was in really good shape but it still looked real nice the the interior was still really nice there what'n cracks all over the dash board and stuff and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it had some some nice features so i ended up okay with the Buick
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		and i anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever i decide to sell it course i may never sell it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i may drive it till it's dead but
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i did with the Mazda drive it till the till the clutch went out and the wheels fell off so probably what i'll do again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i really like the Hondas i like foreign cars a lot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i looked at the Mitsubishi Galant i was looking for a four door car having driven the RX seven so long and it was so small
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's really impractical so i wanted something with a real trunk and four doors something easy to get in and out of and i looked at the Galant and those were really nice and you can get them for a great price
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through so that's how i ended up with a Honda
 	
 	
 		oh
 		hm i wasn't even looking for a car when i bought this car i uh
 		i was thinking about buying a Prelude from a friend who was moving to New York or something so
 		and she was gonna sell her car because she didn't need it anymore and it was only like a year old
 		and i had never driven uh a Prelude so i went to a dealership because they had like uh the same year and same model of Prelude on their used car lot and i went and i test drove it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know i just fell in love with this brand new white Prelude
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you know two liter SI with the the sun roof and the moon roof and i i bought it loaded
 	
 	
 		they're nice i think
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah i have to have them loaded i i love all those little things that you don't need but they're so wonderful
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		yeah
 		yeah i went there looking at a used car and two days later i bought this car i i felt i felt like
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that was the worst impulse that was that was the largest impulse buy i had ever made the other the two other things that i've bought on impulse are VCR and a washer and dryer i go for the big stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i would say
 		
 
 		yeah i noticed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		mine was definitely not impulse i really needed a new car mine was just it's getting worn out i guess from being a sports car i drove it kind of hard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i got it right after high school so
 		by the time i traded it in it was ready ready to go
 	
 	
 		yeah i got
 		i got my Buick as a high school graduation gift
 	
 	
 		did you
 	
 	
 		yeah but i i guess this what'n really an impulse i mean buying it right then and you know right quickly was kind of impulsive but i'd been thinking about buying a new car for three years and i was just scared to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for
 	
 	
 		right that's same with me would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself
 	
 	
 		buy a  buy a buy a used car sure
 	
 	
 		like
 		right
 		i i was going to buy one once and i just i worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and
 		the warranties and things like that just i can't seem to get over that that just bothers me i don't know why
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well um like on Hondas
 		they supposedly the maintenance records are supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		mean they can't stop you from doing it so
 	
 	
 		hoping that they do go to a Honda dealership to get them serviced
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well and even if they didn't you can still get a good idea from a if you can get a good mechanic to check it over real carefully and check the blocks and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well
 		i guess that's all
 	
 	
 		okay well i enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		i enjoyed talking to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		
  
 		bye-bye
