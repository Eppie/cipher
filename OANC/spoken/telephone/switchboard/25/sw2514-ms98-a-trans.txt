 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay Dee are you familiar with the Latin American policies of late
 	
 	
 		um yeah to a point it's not my best subject
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		really yeah it's not mine either but uh i know
 		i know our policy i like in Nicaragua i'm familiar with that  because we have um some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border and they're they're missionaries there and they
 		they live there and they have to travel by boat forty five minutes to get to their car and stuff
 		and uh i know that they helped a lot of those Sandinistas refugees
 		coming across the border and they housed them and stuff they've been down there about three years now and they lived it's kind of weird  they have bats in their roof but the bats eat the bad spiders so they leave the bats you know so uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a whole whole different culture um it it's weird down there because
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's all lizards and things running around that people who live there they just they take it for granted and it's like we go down there on vacation it's like oh how can these people live with these lizards and like bats in their house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i think their policy with them that though is um i don't know i think
 		i wish we would have just i'm not that up on the policy of way i know that's kind of old but i don't know i just i'm glad that
 		the Sandinistas aren't in power anymore because i think that they were  very wicked and uh probably some of the biggest drug dealers that the world has probably ever seen and i feel like
 		most of the leaders in Latin America are probably you would be safe to say that they were just very very you know big into drugs
 	
 	
 		yeah their very corrupt like the Panamanians Panamanians are were very corrupt
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		the thing about it is like the Panamanians is a lot of servicemen down there a lot of a lot of American servicemen are involved
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i guess there was a big big uh scam they they set all these guys up and like a dozen servicemen got caught for running a drug ring
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		so it's it's like everybody is into it it's just greed human greed interestingly about about that country is in Honduras
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's very pro American
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we have i my girlfriend used to uh be in the Navy and she was based uh based in Panama
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in Honduras its very um uh pro American and there's a lot of American i don't know how many American uh soldiers are there but there's a lot i mean they uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and you can't the American government you can't trust them either because you think
 		you don't know how corrupt they are i mean they keep people in power like the Shah of Iran and things like that i mean it's the lesser of two evils they'll probably you know say this is the lesser of two evils
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't know how corrupt the Honduran government is but the
 	
 	
 		yeah i they need to have more checks and balances in their government to  get rid of the corruption but i think first though i don't know they need to i think turn these people in
 		the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all their uh
 		you know the atrocities that they've commit and the drug dealings and in the just in the drug crimes because i feel like a lot of the leadership of those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they're moved from power
 		that you know but there are so many of them that the next one to come up if you just knock one off you going to have another one
 		and i know a lot of those nations there's uh Brazil i know is like forty percent evangelical Christian not just go to church but
 		you know really on fire for God and they're just surpassing America Latin America by
 		the drugs you know it's just incomprehensible and uh so i just think that i think that God's going to honor that and that he's going to put in some good leadership and i know the president of i believe Costa Rica
 		is a Christian and he goes to no Guatemala because he goes to Virgo Church in Guatemala City our church is in real close relationship with him
 		and he is a former president of Guatemala he's an elder at Virgo Church and
 		you know that that God is doing something he is raising up some leaders and the people want him back as president bad but they have a rule in Guatemala that he can't have another term
 		so they're the people are trying to override that i mean not just the Christians but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority the people rejoice so yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah good see that's the thing that is going to have to that's the undoing of everything is that we have no morals i mean
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		talk about the crime and all that in the city it's just the kids have no morals that's the thing that will eventually you know if anyone is going to be saved it is having a good moral background
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um but it's funny you will mention Costa Rica because i guess they're one of the most successful and peaceful countries in Central America
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i know
 	
 	
 		so i was reading an article in uh National Geographic and i don't know i don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries they don't have oil or anything and they don't have big tourism
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so maybe it is their faith that has enabled them to keep the crime out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i know that Costa Rica they don't allow anybody to come in that um
 		to come in any uh what do you call what do you call immigrants they don't allow anything like that like i could not go to Costa Rica and live
 		as an American citizen they would not permit me to move there to work they wouldn't their jobs are there for Costa Ricans they don't allow people to move in like less nations you know and take the jobs
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't they don't probably don't take a lot of refugees from other countries either
 	
 	
 		no they don't take any i mean i couldn't even go there my husband couldn't we would have to receive all this special permission to go there
 		for even when some you know in in inner
 		company you know transfer or something
 		and i have another friend from uh Costa Rica that she was born there she's Costa Rican i guess i do know a little bit i went to Mexico City one time
 		and stayed i've been there twice and stayed and that was that was just really sad but a lot of it though is their debt i think that we should not loan them anymore money that if we still want to give them money give them money
 		quit loaning it to them you're not going to get it back don't be indebted to anybody don't be the you know loaner nor borrower and it's just not good we need to if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them but quit loaning all the money out which i don't think we're loaning anymore now but
 		that's how we got into a problem if we got them we have sink them in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars that common sense you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back
 	
 	
 		yeah also uh uh Mexico that we will loan the money in uh
 		a lot of the higher the higher people were just stealing it and building these beautiful homes and nice ranches and things so we are we're suckers
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 		uh-huh
 		Lo Mas yeah
 		yeah we we are now it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money
 		that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them you don't loan money to people like that i mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out fine but you don't go making
 		billions of dollars of loans in to people that you can just look at the situation and yeah and know that they are not going to be capable of paying us back and
 	
 	
 		they know they're not going to pay it back
 	
 	
 		that puts a bondage on them it makes you know pressure on the nation and on the people on the leadership and makes their inflation go up and it's just a big mess so
 	
 	
 		you
 		did you go to Mexico City uh anywhere near when the earthquake hit
 	
 	
 		no but i knew people i was there before that but i knew people i got a letter from a friend of mine that i had met there that who who the apartment building was destroyed and they were living in a tent so it's kind of weird you know
 		because these were people he was on the US dive the Mexican diving Olympic pool he'd go watch them dive and all this so they were you know just normal people weren't squatters or poor people or anything that
 		um i did i knew all of my friends there but none of them that i know of got killed in it
 		but um they're all Christians though  God really protected them see that broke out a revival in Mexico City that CBS new s and ABC never told you about there's been a real revival in Mexico City since that earthquake because there's a lot of
 		man there's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot lots of witchcraft a lot of witchcraft a whole lot of witchcraft
 	
 	
 		oh i could imagine
 	
 	
 		so a lot of it in the name of Christianity
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so you know oh yeah there's a lot you know they call themselves Christians but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff and
 		just a whole the lot of it generational things too like the Mayans and the Incas you can't find a trace of them because God totally destroyed them for how wicked they were
 		and yet they're revered and honored and almost worshipped by so many people even now in America you know everyone's all intrigued with all of these Indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth
 		because of how wicked they were i've been down to the pyramids and i've climbed to the top of the pyramid of the sun where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy and then hold it up to the sun God and that's pretty heavy duty you know
 	
 	
 		yeah is is there still blood stains on the altar or has it worn away all through the years
 	
 	
 		i don't think there are the little box is black on the top of the pyramid of the sun it's black so yeah you can't really tell but it is kind of weird you know you think wow there is where they did human sacrifices to false Gods and
 	
 	
 		is it
 		do you get spooked you feel or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there because
 	
 	
 		um at that time i kind of did it was a very oppressed eerie just you know feeling but i wasn't a Christian when i went there but uh i think that all those
 		those you know generational things i think that God did i'm praying you know that keeps the Christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray because that does affect that things you know those in your background
