 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all set do you want to start
 	
 	
 		i can go ahead and start uh
 	
 	
 		sure go ahead
 	
 	
 		in Dallas there's definitely a crime problem i know it's you know worse in the larger cities um it's kind of a concern for me in fact at the moment i'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment and uh it's
 		i am single and female you definitely are going to worry about the location and uh
 	
 	
 		oh God
 	
 	
 		you know accessibility of people to be able to break in i live on a third floor now but i you know i'm real concerned that i i don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that and
 	
 	
 		do they have many buildings that have security there
 	
 	
 		the um
 		some buildings do it depends on the location the area i live in right now is is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we don't have
 		anything at all no burglar alarms no guards some some places do have guard gates that you have to get through or electronic access gates and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i i went to Dallas um when i worked for TI in Abilene and uh i i'm a little familiar with the city area Forest Lane and you know through that off off the freeway
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it didn't seem like it was that congested in that that part you know because to me where we live out here in the north east it it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the cities are very populated with tenement housing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where there are more than one family in a house
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and with with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language and uh they're they're going to the big cities it makes it very difficult
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it really does and and i i've seen the same thing that you're talking about uh much more crime than ever before drugs of course uh a big part of it i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i don't know a lot of younger people you know into more violent crimes
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that that that's really sad you know you got young boys or girls that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and no remorse what so ever
 	
 	
 		um-hum there's a lot of that going on in Dallas too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's really sad
 	
 	
 		it is and and i don't know if it's uh the family you know thing where they're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the kids aren't getting the attention that they need or the television
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i i really think that we're we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people
 	
 	
 		oh i agree i think that people are getting off too easy they're getting they're getting paroled too easily they're just getting uh put on probation or something because the prisons don't have enough room so they get they get
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they get lighter sentences and some of those people they don't deserve to be let loose
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly
 		and and you know they had uh in fact on the news last night we were watching this uh man who lost his ten year old daughter
 		he ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone she now ten years old she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store that's what it was
 		and uh someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and the whole bit and one of the men got uh i think it was seventeen years and the other one was in for uh life imprisonment
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven and he's out
 	
 	
 		uh
 		that's terrible but
 	
 	
 		and the man said that you know if if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself and then go to McDonald's and have a hamburger and not thing a thing think a thing about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i mean i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that innocent people i i shouldn't say innocent because i mean actually actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know it's like two different things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things
 	
 	
 		right
 		it's a little more understandable under the circumstances i guess
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		i i like the idea
 		that uh if someone is from a foreign country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they come to this country
 		and uh commit a crime i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		especially if they're found guilty of the crime
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know once they they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty that's it we don't take care of them we don't support them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		nothing i mean they go right back where they came from
 	
 	
 		right we have enough enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is so let let their country take care of it we don't have i guess too much trouble in Dallas with well i guess i guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		and
 	
 	
 		that cause problems but uh
 	
 	
 		but that's uh they're they're so close i i don't consider Mexican people in the same category with uh especially like uh people who come from cultures that don't have the same uh kind of moral upbringing that we have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		like you take Asian countries or uh the Eastern countries
 		where women are like in the foreground uh in the background and the men are in the foreground and it's like you know um they live back in where where we came from two hundred years ago you know we've we've advanced beyond that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think that their uh mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		um-hum it was amazing i went to the Far East uh back in October to do some training for TI and i uh
 	
 	
 		it's
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		some of those countries were so safe it was unreal Singapore is very supposed to be very safe and in fact Tokyo and i thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they at at the TI there i said is there any area i should avoid and the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl and said
 		can you think o f any place where Dana shouldn't go by herself or anything and she she thought for a few minutes and she said no and he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself she said no

 		and they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and somebody will turn it in and the and nothing will be missing they said they can just about guarantee that there uh that that would happen if you did that i thought boy  in America if you left a purse on a subway you would never see it again
 	
 	
 		wow
 		you better believe it if you wouldn't even have to leave it i mean it would get snatched right off your arm
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		that's true but i was thinking boy in Dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night i'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out i mean
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		i couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place they said the crime apparently the crime is just uh
 	
 	
 		that's amazing well what's what's the difference there do you know
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure what it is there now i know what it is in Singapore is they have the death penalty and they really enforce it like for drugs
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh i i believe in the death penalty i really do
 	
 	
 		for drugs they they enforce the death penalty for that uh they're just very very tough and i guess maybe that's the way Tokyo is too or Japan is too they're just very tough on criminals
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think that we're too easy uh and we take the the uh civil liberties uh stuff too far
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know like people that are in prison i mean we didn't put them there they put themselves in that situation and as far as like them uh entertaining the rights that they should have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean we educate them we feed them we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm not saying they're all bad but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think that they should be put away
 	
 	
 		and if they're overcrowded well you know
 		they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place
 	
 	
 		get rid of them
 		exactly i i really i i think that that's the whole key here this plea bargaining baloney
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where uh you know they plead to a lesser crime or uh they plead guilty in or you know tell about someone else and they they get less time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior they get for every year they're in they get so many less
 		you know that they don't serve the full penalty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		i agree because it's not fair to those of us that that deserve a safe you know life to have to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		same with drunk drivers
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think it's too easy for them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that if the the laws and and uh were were harsher and were enforced
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean you have to set an example you have to start somewhere
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		an i and i feel bad for the policeman because he's out there every day facing these people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		this this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job and let's face it what do they get paid
 	
 	
 		right not much
 	
 	
 		twenty thousand dollars a year if they're lucky i wouldn't do it for that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hum-um and especially not in some of these big cities like in Dallas i mean they've had they're up in the top top five i think of cities that are getting policeman killed on on in the line of duty and that's really sad
 	
 	
 		it is it really is and i mean they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and uh i'm not saying that they're all good either because there's good and bad in everything but they they're already uh have strikes three strikes against them when they're out there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because they'll arrest someone and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence and you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them uh you know what they say
 	
 	
 		right
