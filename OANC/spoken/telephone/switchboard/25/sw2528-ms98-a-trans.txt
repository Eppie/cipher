 
     		
 	
 		yeah so uh what are your favorite TV shows
 	
 	
 		
 
 		one that i can't find anymore which is Gabriel's Fire
 	
 	
 		oh i haven't watched that very much is that do you like that
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		when was that on
 	
 	
 		it was usually on um Thursday nights
 	
 	
 		on ABC
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh oh yeah well
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um um it may be that um it was recently replaced
 		by actually by um by what may be my favorite TV show of because sort of uh um Twin Peaks
 	
 	
 		it was same time period yes
 	
 	
 		yeah so Twin Peaks um what happened was
 		i think Twin Peaks um went went off
 		they moved to a Saturday night for a while and then put and then put something i guess Gabriel's Fire on it and at Thursday nights and then they moved um
 		no Gabriel's Fire was on CBS i think i i take that back
 		i'm not sure but anyway they moved it back and forth and that's when Peaks was back in that time slot as well
 		so i don't know
 	
 	
 		you don't know what happened to Gabriel's Fire then
 	
 	
 		no i have no idea
 		i don't think
 		i don't think that was on ABC anyway i don't know what happened to it though
 	
 	
 		i don't remember one from one station to another i keep forgetting one station
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what's your second favorite
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's hard to say
 		i'm sort of a very big Twin Peaks fan and beyond that i just sort of watch anything that happens to be on i'm i'm
 		half the time i'm a TV addict and the other half the time i just ignore it
 		it's really bad yeah there's some new shows that i sort of like um
 		have you seen this Shannon Steel Show or uh
 		it's about a lawyer it's one of these lawyer shows you know they they seem to be popular these days
 		and then there's just a lot of those sort of Blair shows floating around
 	
 	
 		oh is he the reformed um gambler yes yes yes
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i just i mean like i just finished watching that a few minutes ago  um and it and that that's a interesting one i i i like that because there's there are
 		i've noticed that every every major station now has their own law show there's LA Law and there's um Equal Justice
 		some other one Law And Order or something
 		lots of lots of these things that are floating around now they seem to be popular shows do you like the law shows or
 	
 	
 		i really don't watch that much TV what i do is i tape the programs i want to watch and then on the nights i can watch i'll pick out something
 		but um
 	
 	
 		that that makes logical sense also saves a lot of time with commercials
 	
 	
 		you're not kidding do you ever watch American Gladiators
 	
 	
 		oh i have i've i've caught i watched that late um i guess it's on late Saturday nights or something that's on during the day as well
 	
 	
 		midnight
 		midnight
 	
 	
 		have you have have you seen this often
 	
 	
 		i tape it
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah i tape it because i don't stay up that late to watch it i tape it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i understand uh that in England they play it at normal times because they don't consider that violent
 		and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program
 	
 	
 		really
 		i don't know that
 	
 	
 		and
 		i'm like i don't believe this
 	
 	
 		i
 		that don't it it it seems like i mean if wrestling is prime time
 		professional wrestling it seems like it's just
 		just just like pros in a wrestling to me i don't i don't see any difference though
 	
 	
 		i don't either
 	
 	
 		i i don't understand it they consider it violent i have so ever i have seen it on
 		where we are i live in uh Rochester New York
 		and i think a
 	
 	
 		you're in New York
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		where are you
 	
 	
 		i'm in Dallas Texas
 	
 	
 		you're uh everybody i speak to is in Texas oh
 		oh yeah but i'm i'm in New York
 		and uh we seem we seem to have um i think the American Gladiators is on
 		Sunday afternoons actually around here
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		as well sometimes
 		i think it's been on i think i've seen it during the day
 		i know i've seen it during the day in Florida
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		when i was at my parents down there
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		definitely seen it done on on during the day down there and i don't think it's a very violent show i think it's funny
 		i think it's a real good concept i think it's something completely new
 	
 	
 		i think it's great i love watching a microbiologist
 		fighting off with a policemen or something else and competition
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm going oh great you know
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a great role model for everybody
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so i think because people sort of get through you know um
 		i think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical
 		fitness as well as the
 		as well as you know some mental fitness and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth
 	
 	
 		oh yes i mean when i had uh i was watching it the first time i ever saw a microbiologist on there i thought well it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities
 		and uh there she was terrific she was really terrific
 	
 	
 		well don't they take people who have some sort of
 		um
 		big abilities like and and at least they used to when it when it the first ones i saw they had um a man on who was uh he played college football and almost went pro and they had a
 		a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the uh she was in the junior Olympics or something or they seem to have people who have very very big sports backgrounds to have they leaned leaned away from that sort of
 	
 	
 		they hold competitions in Los Angeles in um Florida and Minneapolis Minneapolis um
 		um trying to think of i think it's in four places around the United States they hold competition and the only requirement
 		is of course your skill of passing these tests
 	
 	
 		oh that's how they do it
 	
 	
 		and that's it
 		and
 		we had a bar man from here in Dallas area that made it there is a woman that uh made
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		well she called herself a craft person so i'm not quite sure what she made
 		and uh she made it i mean there is no your occupation has nothing to do with it
 	
 	
 		yeah okay i just thought they had some
 	
 	
 		strictly your skill
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought they had some sort of i mean i thought they were just poor people like us i guess not that's great
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		but maybe i'll try it one day
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i will get on it one day and see if i can uh
 		um what what do they win they they win money i think don't they
 	
 	
 		i think the last i heard was it's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		wow all that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an hour
 	
 	
 		yeah that's you know just minor
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		just minor little ball here or there you know
 	
 	
 		one little ball here and there yeah and this guy's beating you up
 		so i don't mind the beating up part i i actually feel the tennis balls would hurt
 	
 	
 		oh well they they come out with a lot of bruises too
 	
 	
 		they look like
 		yeah they seem like a tennis ball but there also doesn't look like
 		it's almost livable
 		yeah but best it i i don't think i could i i could handle those tennis balls
 		so what else to you tape besides American Gladiators at there anything else
 	
 	
 		hey
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		see i tape Murder She Wrote
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i like mysteries
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i like mysteries
 		i tape um Father Dowling
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because that's another mystery
 		and i don't have to concentrate too hard on them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but i'm sure that's fun
 	
 	
 		um most of the lawyer programs like uh Law And Order
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they're not on the times that i've got
 		that i've watched because i haven't had T got TV Guide around here in ages
 	
 	
 		oh okay well they seem to be on later all always right right before the news is when i catch them
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i tend to if nothing else i tend to turn on the television at eleven o'clock just to watch the news
 		and or or Nightline or something
 		just sort of get a good you know
 		a good a good think for the day
 	
 	
 		your news is on at eleven
 	
 	
 		yes
 		when is yours on
 	
 	
 		ten i was just in the middle of watching it
 	
 	
 		oh gosh well i'm sorry i interrupted um
 	
 	
 		oh that's okay no problem
 	
 	
 		yeah ours is on actually it ours is on at eleven it it's um eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty five now here in New York um i think they would they do that i think they put things on at
 		um eleven o'clock here and i think they put it like eleven o'clock
 		um California time like in California but in the middle they sort of um like central time or mountain time they they push things back
 		so i was actually actually i'm not sure i was in i was in Iowa awhile ago and noticed that everything was an hour earlier
 		so does your prime time start at seven o'clock
 	
 	
 		no well they have it at six and they have it at nine
 	
 	
 		wait no no not not even the news but do they have like um
 	
 	
 		and they have one at ten
 	
 	
 		do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth start at seven o'clock
 		you so like you know the regular television shows that are that are very popular do they start at seven or or at eight
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to think
 		both um let's see they start um Evening Shade at

 		seven and then it goes to um
 		what is it after Evening um
 	
 	
 		right because that would actually start at eight o'clock here
 	
 	
 		that's Major Dad at eight i think it is
 	
 	
 		yeah that that would all start at at um
 		that would all start at at
 		eight o'clock here that wouldn't start at seven
 		we have um at seven o'clock we just have
 		um the they'll play you know they have old reruns of Cheers or something
 		from seven to seven thirty and then something else from seven thirty to eight but then at
 		at eight o'clock is when everything starts
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		which is
 		which is strange i mean because yours start at seven and end at ten and ours start at
 		at at at at eight and end at eleven that's why we  i i would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's stopped around here at ten and it goes into night programs
 		at that point which could be one of you know many different night programs but it goes into night programs
 		but uh do you ever watch Cheers
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		oh all the time
 		do you watch Cheers or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		there's there's it's at that was actually a big dilemma for me now because um Cheers
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Cheers and Twin Peaks are now on the same time
