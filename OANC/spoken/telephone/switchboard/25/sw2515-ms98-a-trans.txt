 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		hi Maureen how are you
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		well do you have a family budget
 	
 	
 		no we probably should but we haven't so why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done which you've found useful and workable
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay we do a few things and i have to say we're my husband and i are both from financial backgrounds i i'm an accountant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh he has an MBA so uh we were sort of you know keyed in on expenses and things like that so  um
 	
 	
 		um okay
 	
 	
 		coming from that background what we pretty much do is we our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget
 		every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws you know X amount of dollars for the month and then that money is used during that month we have a certain budget
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 		for instance i control all the household expenses the groceries uh the haircuts the gasoline for my car
 		any miscellaneous expenses babysitting things like that and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 		if uh it comes the end of the month and i don't have any money uh  we don't buy any more milk
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh we've gotten pretty good at it we've been doing it a couple of years now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we our budgets are realistic and they are not
 		so stringent as you know to make us feel uncomfortable
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh and i i really try to stretch my my dollars here and there shopping uh at warehouses sometimes like at Sam's and things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh we live we live on on a cash budget and it sometimes it's tight come the end of the month but generally we always make it
 	
 	
 		what do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for the you know are sometimes several hundred dollars like uh
 		tires for the car or car repair of some sort or like a a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for
 	
 	
 		right
 		well uh most of our medical things we don't uh have to worry about because of insurance and
 		they're they're relatively small uh we've been lucky in the past we didn't have that problem but right now we don't for the other things the things that crop up that we aren't really expecting we have different funds
 		set aside for different things like we have a car fund and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i mean and i i can't really remember what it is
 	
 	
 		do you kind of continue call this like a part of savings account or a different savings account
 	
 	
 		it's all part of the savings account we just keep track of it on paper uh you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account we decide okay you know let's say it's a hundred dollars you know every month fifteen dollars is for car fund
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		you know ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever uh and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we just we constantly do that so that there's a build up of money for those things if something does come up like i know that my washing machine is going to go any day and
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so but we have the money set aside so if it does it's not going to kill us
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh so we're we're actually we're pretty disciplined so it makes those surprises not so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		difficult to get through
 	
 	
 		okay
 		then so like your pay what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that you know will cover all of the expenses
 		kind of thing
 	
 	
 		well in
 	
 	
 		or like what what percent do you then save or something
 	
 	
 		uh we have a lot of different things right now we save about twenty five percent
 		of our of our pay
 	
 	
 		hm okay
 	
 	
 		it and it goes toward different things it's for you know for vacations like i said for you know emergencies like for car uh breaks down something like that uh and we also put money aside for our kids college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		neither of us had any help with our college degrees and just this last month we paid off my final school loan so  we're starting our kids a little bit early
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		do you uh use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things
 	
 	
 		checking account a lot  uh not so much credit cards now several years back i used to use charge uh charge cards and you know all the time kind of thinking oh well it's on sale you know it must be a good deal and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		there have been times that i have been bad about the credit cards and so pretty much now uh we don't use them too much if we travel or something yeah but you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		standard we usually don't or if it it is a purchase uh then it's paid off when the bill comes
 		you know so it isn't any extended uh it may be that i picked up something at the store but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then so it's not any you know uh build up on the charge cards at all
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		and but that hasn't always been the case  so i'm kind of i feel at least better now that i have finally gotten some of those things uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know in the past and i don't have you know big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest rate just is a killer
 	
 	
 		oh and it's not deductible anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow but uh
 	
 	
 		or you can get deduct anyway yeah
 	
 	
 		pretty much when i always i go to the grocery store or something i just always write checks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we did we did that for a long time and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things and it seemed like we didn't have enough money when
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		things cropped up you know so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be and then we kept track of everything for a month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know how much we spent on food how much we spent on gasoline how much we spent on everything and from that built you know a cash budget so now i mean i have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't remember what it is now four hundred dollars for the month let's say and uh i mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		some months it may be different it's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves you know down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know
 		uh utilities and uh the house payment and all that those are things you don't really have much control over
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh
 		the cash budget just fits right in there  like i said if we don't have we also set aside money for entertainment i mean it's but again it's a set amount every month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh on special occasions i mean birthdays and things like that we
 		we don't we still have fun on things
 	
 	
 		yeah uh we are in the process of trying to buy a house do you know how did your budget work or did you have a budget to uh get your down payment going to get a house
 	
 	
 		well no not originally because when we we did buy when we bought our first house it was at a time where you and the kind of loan we got you really didn't have to put down anything
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so we got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so we we got out of that one pretty easily
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i just keep thinking all the time i mean it it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your you know
 		your priority at least mine is to save for the house but then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment you feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime
 	
 	
 		sure i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's how i feel sometimes about my kids' education
 		i mean jeez they are one and four
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we have got a long time to save my husband he's the real
 		he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh no no
 	
 	
 		well i know but there are times when i sit there and i think wow you know we make X amount of money and
 		where is it i mean you look around and you go where is it you you haven't made uh big purchases and that's the easier thing to see if you can see a big purchase and you go okay well this is the year that we bought the couch or the TV or something like that
 	
 	
 		what do you do with it now
 		uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		but all those you know
 		just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries and stuff that you don't have tangible i mean the perishable kind of things that's gone used and gone
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah it's it's amazing how much we spend on
 		some things my husband cut himself
 		down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that's all he has he has a ten dollar bill
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i mean so i'd say at least
 		two usually three times a week he takes his lunch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the other times he'll
 		uh i don't know
 		go out somewhere eat in a cafeteria or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but but he keeps himself on that i mean he found
 		it's it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's a hundred dollars a month on lunch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		when he can take a sandwich you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
