 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right what uh what kind of camping is there in Texas
 	
 	
 		well there there are quite a few um parks i guess state parks and there's a couple of national parks i guess that you can camp at
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um most of them have pretty good facilities
 		i don't know if the camping that i've done is really roughing it without a a whole lot of stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so you do uh like backpacking and the like
 	
 	
 		uh done a little bit of that mainly just um
 		camping out at state parks i've been to a couple in Texas and there's some real nice ones in Arkansas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i think Arkansas has one of the best parks departments around
 	
 	
 		huh
 		is the Ozarks in Arkansas
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah part of them are
 	
 	
 		yeah so that's probably a pretty nice place to go
 	
 	
 		yeah they've got uh real nice lake system and
 		around their parks and
 		one of them uh the Gray i think that's one of the ones we've been to it's is real nice there a bunch of lakes around it there's a golf course and  um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just a whole bunch of camping sites
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what about you where have you uh
 	
 	
 		oh i've been camping for years not on a regular basis but uh i first started camping out in the desert in California
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then sometimes in the mountains also in California
 		and uh then i moved to North Carolina and i i didn't camp for a long time and then i started to uh
 		go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting so i'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then maybe camp another night and drive home
 		and that was uh that was pretty good so i went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear
 		and uh
 		you know i still do it once in a while
 	
 	
 		yeah i think we've collected stuff off and on over the years
 		the more times we did it the more serious we get about it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		where where is Raleigh in North Carolina
 	
 	
 		uh well it's it's uh in terms of north south i would say it's uh a little a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what it
 	
 	
 		so you're kind of away from the Blue Ridge Mountains that area
 	
 	
 		well it it's uh actually the the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh they're about three hours away if you go due north
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um uh the Blue Ridge in North Carolina i think are much nicer and you can pick those up going west but then you're talking about six to eight hours
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the way it works
 		but um
 		it's a real it's a real nice place to go and camp and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although i don't think Raleigh i don't think the state of North Carolina takes
 		they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah my wife's from the western part of Virginia we've been down the parkway a lot but i didn't know how much how much camping areas there were along there
 	
 	
 		i think there's quite a few
 		i can't say i've checked them all out though
 	
 	
 		what what's it like camping in the desert and California that seems like a challenge
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's actually kind of incredible it's really really nice
 		um
 		i like it better than almost anything i've ever done just the sky is so
 		amazing
 		you know you really can
 		probably count thousands of stars and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's it's just kind of nice i like the uh i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty
 		which um
 		a lot of people don't realize you know they hear desert and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and
 		being real dry and lack of water course it it has all of those qualities but it also has a certain quality of beauty that's
 		you just don't find anywhere else except in a desert
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it's pretty nice the uh
 		the movie The Doors has some some nice desert scenes those guys all go camping out in the desert
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of course they drag a lot of drugs with them but
 		um
 		the uh the shots are are pretty nice and it's sort of like that i mean it's just almost surreal in some places it's very pleasant
 	
 	
 		hm
 		are are the temperatures real extreme there or they just
 	
 	
 		they can be yeah i mean you got to you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what i've been i've been camping in Death Valley
 		one doesn't go in July
 	
 	
 		yeah  true
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but it's beautiful in February i mean it's just beautiful the days get up into the high eighties
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh maybe the nineties but it's it's quite bearable and then the nights are reasonably warm you know sixties or seventies
 		it's just great it's really very nice
 	
 	
 		yeah we've talked about planning a trip up through um
 		i have a sister-in-law that lives in New Mexico up through New Mexico and into Colorado and the Grand Canyon area
 		i don't know don't know when i'm going to get a chance to do that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that would be
 		that would be pretty nice i've been i have been camping on the south rim of the Grand Canyon
 		that's okay a lot of people like to go down and camp down inside i was just too lazy that trip to
 		do all that walking especially with my gear
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i'll bet
 		yeah one one thing you said about the stars is really true it's when you're close to a big city like Dallas the the lights kind of wash wash out the star so it's nice to
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		to get away
 		it's just amazing how how much you miss
 	
 	
 		yeah it
 		yeah it really it really is
 		i mean i don't think i ever see the Little Dipper you hear people talk about the Little Dipper
 	
 	
 		hm um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't think i ever
 		see it except when i go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in in the mountains
 		otherwise it's just too faint
 	
 	
 		well i guess we've
 		talked as much as we need to on the subject
 	
 	
 		yeah i think we fulfilled our obligation well thanks for calling nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		um yeah it was good talking to you Robert bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
