 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		why don't you go ahead and start
 	
 	
 		okay my hobby is uh sewing i i've just uh started learning how to sew
 		and uh i've taken some classes and i've made a few few garments do you sew at all
 	
 	
 		i used to uh i i sewed you know in high school and when i went to college i think everything in my closet i had made but i haven't sewed since then and that's been fifteen years
 	
 	
 		did you
 	
 	
 		so uh you know i didn't have access to a machine the whole time i was in college
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh my sister sewed and she needed the money so i would pay her and she'd make my clothes
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh and then just in the last you know ten or twenty i just haven't sewn anything i would love to i would like to get back to it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh uh clothes are getting so expensive now in in the stores and the the quality is is sometimes so poor that uh it it really is worth while to sew
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it is you know an even back then i remember you could make something for you know half what it cost to buy and of course the quality was just exceptional
 	
 	
 		right an
 	
 	
 		uh now it's a little more expensive to make it because you you know you start paying the price for the patterns and the material but it's still such better quality that i think it's worth it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it certainly is and the patterns have gone up tremendously too the prices for them
 		you used to could get you know a pattern for two or three dollars now they're like you know five six seven eight
 	
 	
 		you're kidding me
 	
 	
 		oh no i'm not
 	
 	
 		see i can remember paying seventy five cents for a pattern
 	
 	
 		huh-uh no the the cheapest ones now are like maybe four uh four or five five dollars
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		six seven and then you get into the vogues they get up to into twelve and fifteen and on like that
 	
 	
 		good night well do you have kids and a husband are you sewing for a whole family or
 	
 	
 		uh right now i'm just sewing for myself i i do have two daughters that you know out they're they're grown now though i wish that i had started sewing you know when they were younger
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it would have helped me out tremendously  but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh i guess i i just
 		you know i always i have always tried to sew and uh i didn't like the way it looked so i'd never wear anything but now i i really have bought some uh new sewing equipment i bought the Serger machine
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it really makes it look professional and i've taken some classes here in in uh Dallas
 	
 	
 		well and that always is helpful for starters you know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		i know a lot of people where i work make their clothes it's just there's just so many people sewing now days
 	
 	
 		that's true well do you do anything else do you knit or crochet like for sweaters or anything like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh-uh no i'm not that talented
 	
 	
 		no
 		see i'm not i've not ever been a real craft type person i have a sister-in-law that i mean if it can be done with your hands she does it she makes things for the kids for Christmas and nephews and nieces and i look at them and i think
 		God you know i i should be able to do things like this
 	
 	
 		right
 		i have a sister that can can uh crochet real well or or knit i i guess i mean knit and she knits things like hats and uh sweaters an you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well when my sister oh when my sister had her first uh child my niece and this is we're talking fifteen years ago i was it was my last year of college
 	
 	
 		bed throws
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares so she did and i crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when we broke things off actually we were supposed to get married when i got out of college so when we broke things off i quit crocheting it and i've never picked up a needle since then in fact i think it's still sitting in the top of the closet
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		one of these days i keep thinking i'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		yeah now now they have the uh knitting machines that will do it for you
 	
 	
 		fast
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my problem i guess is time you know i i talk to my husband we kind of planning for the time eventually when you know maybe i can quit work while my kids because i my kids are young i have a three and a half and a two year old
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		and he says but Bev i think you'll be so bored because you know all you've ever done is work and i said but there's so many things i want to do i'd like to start sewing again i'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these you know knit these things and i think that would be fascinating he kind of laughs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		are you familiar with what a Serger is uh the Serger sewing machine
 	
 	
 		i don't think so
 	
 	
 		well you know in when we used to sew we'd sew the seam and then we'd finish the edges and we we would uh trim the seams and finish the edges
 	
 	
 		sure
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well this machine does it all in one step it's
 	
 	
 		you're kidding so like as you're sewing the seam it's finishing off the inside edge
 	
 	
 		right and it's cutting off the uh the there there are two knives and it cuts off the uh you know excess seam allowance
 	
 	
 		well that takes all the work out of it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh it it really makes it look professional
 	
 	
 		well how neat
 	
 	
 		especially on you know i mean from the inside you know how you look under under something that you've made and it doesn't really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh the Serger really makes it look professional
 	
 	
 		well that's neat
 	
 	
 		they're pretty expensive i like i paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine
 	
 	
 		for the machine yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so since i bought it and paid that much for it i guess i'd better might as well get some use out of it  yes i'm going to have to do it
 	
 	
 		you have to learn how to do it that's right
 		otherwise they hold it over your head forever right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		now i bought you that machine  well that sounds really good
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you paint or anything like that
 	
 	
 		no no i i play the piano
 	
 	
 		never
 		oh so do i
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		except well i have one here it's the one that i grew up with and my folks gave it to me and uh a couple years ago when they uh they sail and so they sold their home and they they've been sailing and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's here but i haven't touched one like since college so i kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again and of course my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it and i'd love to teach them to play too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm not great but i remember it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i'm not that great either i used to be a lot better than i am now i i have played for uh the church choir and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i played for the choral club in high school and
 		but i you know i don't practice a lot anymore and uh you know you get rusty
 	
 	
 		you do
 	
 	
 		you really
 	
 	
 		you do
 	
 	
 		i never thought i would get rusty but i'm rusty now
 	
 	
 		well i i figure it takes practice and i i don't i say i don't have the time that's not true by the time i put my kids in bed at night i don't want to do anything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i you know i've worked all day and i come home and i do that i and you know even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that i i think gee i could do this or that i have an hour here i don't want to do them sometimes i'm too tired
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		so i try to save that for the weekend i need to get better at it though
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well sewing does take up take an awful lot of time takes an awful lot of time
 	
 	
 		now the part about sewing that i never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out if if somebody would lay it out for me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		then i didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it i could do that all day long and i i can remember once in high school i wanted some extra money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and my mom wanted some pants so she laid out the material and i cut it and sewed it and she paid me i think like two dollars a pair  to make her some pants
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i i hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and make sure it's on the right lines and not on the bias and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		on the on the right on the straight grain and all that stuff uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yes on the grain of the fabric
 		it drives me crazy
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's that's the part that i don't like too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i like sewing sewing up the garment itself i really like to do that but the the cutting and the
 		all the even the cutting i don't like
 	
 	
 		well what are some of the other features on this machine it sounds wonderful
 	
 	
 		well that's about it really it's it has four uh four threads instead of the the regular basic two threads
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh it's
 	
 	
 		is that for designs or is that for the regular seam in the fabric or
 	
 	
 		no you you can either use three or four of the threads
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh it's kind of it the stitch is kind of like a knitting machine like the they're loopers under the bottom
 		and then the there's a seam stitch and it's the loopers that form the the edge you know that edge finish
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh that's what really makes it look professional you can do a lot with the Serger though you can make uh piping and cording and
 		uh you can use all kinds of different uh
 		textures of thread
 	
 	
 		so it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do
 	
 	
 		and
 		well
 		yes but you you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine you can't throw your sewing machine away you you you need it to do things like button holes and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		seams that need to be really strong need to be done on the sewing machine
 	
 	
 		so the Serger is not a sewing machine itself it's something that goes with it
 	
 	
 		it's uh
 	
 	
 		like an attachment or
 	
 	
 		no it's it's a it's a it's a machine it's not exactly a sewing machine but it does it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff but there are other are other things that
 		a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do like you can't top stitch with it
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		you know you can't do top stitching or um
 		
 
 		there's there's a few few things that you just can't do with it it will also do a rolled edge um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		gee it's just so versatile like i remember
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i'm going to have to go check it out that's just something i hadn't heard of but it
