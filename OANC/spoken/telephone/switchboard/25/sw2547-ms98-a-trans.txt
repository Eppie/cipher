 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what uh go ahead and tell me about your home
 	
 	
 		well my my home at the moment is an apartment
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i work here in Germantown but i live in Pensacola Florida
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		so i own a home in Pensacola
 		and uh let's see we are to compare homes correct
 	
 	
 		okay yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		my home is well is typical for the area i live in a development uh it's a relatively i would say
 		oh well God it sounds like  sounds like i'm bragging
 	
 	
 		no that's okay
 	
 	
 		no it's upper middle class uh kind of an environment it's a
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		two
 		story
 		colonial which my wife and i designed
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 	
 	
 		uh it has around thirty two hundred square feet
 	
 	
 		wow that's large
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		five bedrooms and so forth and so on
 		and it is i would imagine in terms of
 		of size and so forth it's relatively typical for the area it might be
 		i would say it's probably midsized for the area there are some smaller and there are several you know several larger
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		but in
 		based you know in terms of you know in in Pensacola in that area of Florida
 		it uh
 		it's what now it is uh
 		probably
 		ten years old
 	
 	
 		oh well that's not too bad that's still fairly new
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and so it's
 		in terms of cost and and and size and so forth it uh
 		the house you know housing there is extremely affordable and uh compared to other parts of the country you know let's say compared to Maryland
 		that same house here would probably cost three quarters of a million dollars but
 	
 	
 		well
 		oh you're kidding
 		well do you mind if i ask what it's worth down there i mean what it's
 	
 	
 		i really haven't i really haven't uh
 		when we built it ten years ago
 		it was it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so i i would have really i haven't really priced you know in the market so i
 	
 	
 		huh
 		it it sounds like i mean from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean Dallas is a very marked up area although right now it's a lot lower  um because of all the layoffs and everything the economy around here is real poor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i thought that was on the upswing again now
 	
 	
 		well no not really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		the area itself uh the Fort Worth Dallas area um has
 		become become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies including Texas Instruments  um there's been tremendous amounts of of uh layoffs
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so really housing is real bad the economy itself around here is not too terribly bad but housing is still real bad
 	
 	
 		um-hum well Pensacola has
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's really is a buyer's market there now and it isn't because of the well there is been a lot of speculative building
 	
 	
 		yeah this is
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know perhaps not in Dallas but uh i'm sure people in uh you know in uh Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it uh Pensacola is a Navy town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and home porting was a possibility a few years ago
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they were expecting an influx of
 		something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy  a new carrier was coming in and uh
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		the uh attendant uh support vessels well that's no longer
 	
 	
 		so do you think it was overdeveloped then
 	
 	
 		the case
 		oh it's it is i mean the the number of single family units on sale
 		is phenomenal compared to the population
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and so uh overbuilding is it it has been a real problem there
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so you can still get a get a a good good house for a very very reasonable price and i mean good i would let's say typical
 		say three bedroom uh two and a half baths
 		on a half acre or so of land uh
 		reasonable construction would probably run you uh
 		right now anywhere between
 		somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		um  yeah that's
 	
 	
 		and probably perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what about your home
 	
 	
 		that's well  right now we're just renting but  it is a home um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's a four bedroom home it has about i guess eighteen hundred square feet it's on one floor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we have no basement  i don't know if Pensacopla okay  i wasn't sure most of the ones you know know up north and everything do but  um anyway
 	
 	
 		no nor nor do we but
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's pretty also pretty typical for the area most of this area was developed uh this house was built in seventy four
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so most of the it's almost twenty years old and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style uh we have a friend that lives two blocks over and his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same so i i think most of them are
 		there was it like most areas that are built um there were probably like two or three styles you could choose from
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and uh that's pretty much all the houses in the area
 		uh for probably
 		a square mile i'd say at least maybe even a little bit more than that
 	
 	
 		w ell the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious and in in the entire DC area i'm i'm only about uh
 		twelve miles or so from the
 		uh border of Washington DC
 		and Montgomery County Maryland is probably one of the most expensive
 	
 	
 		where are you in relation to Sevren are you close to Sevren
 	
 	
 		places to
 		no we are west Sevren is East near the Eastern Shore if i had
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		well i just my i have a sister that used to live in Sevren and they bought their home in i i want to say like around
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		nineteen seventy five or something like that and they paid like they they had it built from you know they they designed it and everything
 		and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand so i
 	
 	
 		oh that's not unusual yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so i just wondered you know if the whole area was like that or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's that area over there is not as expensive as in the the immediate you know Washington area
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so we uh
 		i was just looking for example there is a uh
 		condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium
 		and
 		ninety two thousand dollars
 		for two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		now it was very nicely done
 	
 	
 		yeah sounds like a lot of money though
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i i can't i can't envision spending that much money uh and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		for
 	
 	
 		on on something along those lines so you know it's you i guess you pay the piper but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		plus the the the phenomenal taxes around here are phenomenally high uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh for the and so you on that it's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a on an on a
 		what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say for example in Pensacola Florida on that house
 		with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on
 		might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes maybe maybe you know maybe a little bit higher than that now
 	
 	
 		wow yeah
 		that's
 	
 	
 		but that same house here you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year taxes on it
 	
 	
 		wow  wow that's pretty
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so it's uh
 		so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county say drive
 		twenty more miles north buy a condominium for approximately uh the same price maybe a little lower
 		but the taxes would be you know
 		perhaps maybe one third uh of
 	
 	
 		really
 		that much of a difference uh wow
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 		you know so
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		it's it's really sad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this is one this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country
 	
 	
 		wow why is that do you know i mean
 	
 	
 		well they it uh
 		the their they do have an extremely good such things as extremely good school systems for example it has one of the best school systems in the country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and because the cost of living around here is so high public employees make great salaries around here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		well
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the Montgomery County
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Public Schools makes
 		and and and i'm not this is uh the figure he makes eighty thousand dollars a year
 	
 	
 		my goodness  wow
 	
 	
 		that's and i by administrator i i think i mean i they didn't they did not define it but for example a curriculum supervisor or principal or
 		someone you know in that uh in that range
