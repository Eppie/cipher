 
     		
 	
 		well let's go ahead and start with you what kind of kind of pets did you have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay well yeah when i was growing up uh we had dogs all the time so i always had at least two dogs i think at the most we had three
 		and uh then when i met my my wife she was more of a cat person and she kind of more or less got me converted over to cats
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 	
 	
 		and that was the last pets that we had um but uh we we went ahead and gave them away to
 		uh another family you know i put an ad out and had them had them take over the pets
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh because we had uh we started our family and
 		and you know the cats shed a lot and plus they were kind of rough for the babies playing with them and stuff so
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we decided to not have any pets for awhile
 	
 	
 		well cool
 		uh when i was growing up we had a dog one dog and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it had a disease and we had to put it to sleep and that was traumatic and that was traumatic enough for our family for the time being and
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		
  
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they have another one right now at home but i'm not there so that's kind of a bummer but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well we're thinking of maybe as a matter of fact my wife was was telling me that uh when she was out Christmas shopping
 		ah they had a display for one of these pet stores and
 		they had a a cat a cat there and turned out to be ah an older cat about two years old
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it was really good with the boys i've i've got two boys
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		four years old and two years old
 		and she said it was real good with them and uh real
 		real tame cat
 		and she was asking me you know when do you think we should go back and get it now or should we wait a little bit longer and  and i told her well i think we should probably wait
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i you know she's she's gonna want uh get least another cat uh but i think i'd like to go ahead and get get them a dog
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		cool yeah i kind of like dogs myself i think they're just fun to have around fun to play with
 	
 	
 		i think you know i really do think that a dog is more of a a children's pet and a cat's more of an adult's pet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		yeah i tend to agree with that
 	
 	
 		because uh i know i i when i was younger and uh growing up with dogs i didn't like cats at all i didn't want anything at all to do with them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because you know they just don't respond to you the way dogs do
 		and you know that and i you know i feel that that's something that  that a kid looks forward to
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		you know you tell a dog to do something and it does it or you throw a ball and he chases it that kind of thing and he'll  he'll play with you but a cat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		pretty much just keeps to himself and
 		you know you know how cats are
 	
 	
 		right  well i kind of tend to agree i think especially dogs i really when we had ours i enjoyed it just because like you say you know you could throw things at it and he'd go chase it and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		that whenever  there was you know any sense of of urgency or any sense of problems with any of my friends or anybody around our family
 		he would just jump up there and protect us you know he was a small dog and it was just it was good to know that there was always somebody there or something there to to take care of you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i i agree i agree
 		i know that uh
 		you know your yard is always a safe haven and and then if you have got a dog back there  then you're really protected because they they'll they'll stand up for you
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's the i i guess i kind of miss that you know my dad uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well our our the pets that i grew up with all either ran away or died
 		a long time ago and my dad just recently got another dog and it ran away
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		but it was a real small dog and he's thinking of getting another one i don't know if he will or not but he wants to get another dog my mom
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		mom can go either way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		she doesn't really care too much  as long as it's clean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well that's a big thing too at our house it was we couldn't let it in the house but the thing that i think my parents used it most for was to teach us responsibility
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it was our dog and we had to take care of it and if we didn't there was you know definite
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		definite
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		repercussion
 	
 	
 		i think probably i'd be happier happier with just a ordinary mutt you know you get a dog that's uh show quality and you know you got to be real careful with it and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep i agree i think i think a lot of times the mutts the best dogs anyway just because they're you know
 		they really don't you know you care enough about them to to take care of them but not so much that you're worried about what you do with them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		where as if you're paying millions of dollars for it i think you'd be a little more concerned
 	
 	
 		yeah that that you know i don't wanna get into a thing where you take him to shows and and you know all these papers and stuff and you got to be careful and all this and that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know not that you wouldn't take care of it any less but that just something you know i don't want my boys to have to to get into that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i agree i think it's it's a lot more fun when you don't have to worry about the cost of what you spent on it as much as just having it as a friend and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		sure
 		basically a companion and that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly and that's
 		you know it was really weird because although we fought a lot about it you know and who was gonna take care of it when we had it we really all missed it when it was gone
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so
 	
 	
 		i reckon i can agree with that
 		well it was nice talking to y ou
 	
 	
 		hey it's been my pleasure you have a great afternoon
 	
 	
 		all right you too take care bye-bye
 	
 	
 		thanks bye-bye
