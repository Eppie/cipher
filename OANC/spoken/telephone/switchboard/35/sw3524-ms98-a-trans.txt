 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i would say Arlington Texas now because i talked to one night to somebody in Arlington Virginia
 	
 	
 		oh my yeah and well uh Plano Texas rather than Plano Illinois
 	
 	
 		oh do they have one
 	
 	
 		yes they do
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that well i learned something already
 	
 	
 		yeah well let's see the three questions are what um
 	
 	
 		how much time do you spend with your children
 	
 	
 		very little because they're grown they're grown and gone
 	
 	
 		oh what
 		oh yeah well mine's are down at UT Austin in college and the other one's in high school so you do spend less time then because
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah because they don't want to know they almost don't want to know us
 	
 	
 		they wanna be with their friends well how old are your kids are they married or what
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh yes i have uh two married two almost and then two almost married and the other two oh i'm not sure well two single two two  uh uh for sure single
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh  boy you have a lot of kids you
 	
 	
 		yeah we have between the spouse and myself we have six
 	
 	
 		oh that's kind of nice though you
 	
 	
 		because i came with a split family and she had one
 	
 	
 		you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday huh
 	
 	
 		well no there's so much of them are gone and they're doing their own things and
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		and a lot of times they they've got you know  uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		on the holidays a lot
 	
 	
 		they have to see their other parent i guess too
 	
 	
 		yeah and sometimes they want to do their own thing so sometimes it's just spouse and me and and you know what
 	
 	
 		i know
 		right
 	
 	
 		sometimes that's okay
 	
 	
 		i know that's what my mother said one time
 	
 	
 		because you know right because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		for the holidays
 	
 	
 		no that's true and if they force them to you know that's not good either
 	
 	
 		yeah that becomes a drudgery and when you
 	
 	
 		well do they all live in the area
 	
 	
 		well let's see i've got
 		of the six we've got four around here
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh wow
 	
 	
 		uh you know well we're talking like North Texas and then one is in Vermont uh Montpelier Montpelier Monteplier Montpelier Vermont and the other one's in Everett Washington
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		golly
 		how'd they end up so far away
 	
 	
 		well that is  that's the the the my little pair
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my second marriage um and uh
 	
 	
 		those are the youngest ones
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah well the second the the the the fourth and fifth child of the the  of the uh six are the two that are scattered like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		boy that those are a long way how'd
 	
 	
 		and well they wanted to go uh JR my my my least son or my middle son excuse me fell in love with Washington state and the the the third daughter fell in love with uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh Vermont so yeah that's where they've gone to make their homes
 	
 	
 		Vermont so they wanted to make their homes there huh
 		my goodness are they are those two married
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		are they uh just working up there or going to school or what
 	
 	
 		well uh let's see
 		yeah i guess you'd say JR is  working and going to school trying to go to school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i wish to God he would go back
 	
 	
 		oh they do eventually if they have if they're meant to i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i certainly hope so
 	
 	
 		i mean i've got a daughter that's a sophomore at UT and i'm i'm going to UTA right now myself so it's never too late
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well it's oh i agree it's never too late
 	
 	
 		right especially in some of these schools around here i think they have about twenty percent older students
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah and when you're saying older we're talking fifty up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i've seen some people that are really really quite up there  you know they look like in their very late sixties and i say that's great why not you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh my uh-huh
 		yes why not because that's a a lot of times well it's i i believe that uh
 		we in that category and i'm not in that category quite yet
 	
 	
 		but no
 	
 	
 		but we are seasoned minds
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you're really ready to learn finally finally i mean i don't know why i even went to college when i was seventeen it was a complete waste of money
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 		yeah it was
 		yeah settle down we know what we're wanting to to uh study and uh
 	
 	
 		right right now we're
 	
 	
 		we know our limitations
 	
 	
 		right and uh
 	
 	
 		and we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and then the middle altogether
 	
 	
 		no we don't go out drinking beer till three and then you try to go to class in the morning we're past yeah we're past that age
 	
 	
 		at seven yeah
 		yes we're we're smarter than that
 	
 	
 		we know what we can do  oh
 	
 	
 		yack right um so let's see so mine and i don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so the second question  i forgot what the second question
 	
 	
 		what was it what uh how what do the trends in families and do we approve of what other families do
 	
 	
 		well uh the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing but i have seen lately yes i am seeing
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		a change i was gonna say the same thing
 	
 	
 		i'm seeing a change that whoops government can't do it schools are not able to and between a person's religion
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh their their faith in their maker whether whether you know uh whether you're Christian or Jewish or whatever  uh and the family
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		those are the two that can that that have the wherewithal and of course
 	
 	
 		or gonna have sauce on the bone huh
 	
 	
 		Judeo-Christianity uh and the the Jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the uh
 		um
 		mission by the Lord to do this very thing so when another group of of uh people step in try to do it they're they're tromping on our territory so to speak so i firmly believe that uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
