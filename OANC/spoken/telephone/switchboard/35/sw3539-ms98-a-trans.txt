 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well do you exercise regularly
 	
 	
 		there is well i am a school teacher and uh there uh uh girl that went through our school district i teach in Highland Park who uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		who uh does aerobics at uh the YMCA and i say Y them YWCA  turn that off please i am recording
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my husband just turned on something noisy anyway uh she comes to the school and there are a group of teachers and we exercise regularly and for an hour and we do it twice a week
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		and uh we do uh aerobics for cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes and then we do stretching and toning and cool down
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for another thirty minutes so it is an hour and then my husband and i take uh two mile walks
 		uh as often as possible and uh not on the nights that i do aerobics but if if he wants to he jogs but i uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i we take the fast walks and we walk a couple of miles and come back to the house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so we we take it seriously we enjoy doing it i enjoy my group at school it's a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than it is to do it by yourself
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		yeah yeah uh-huh
 		
 
 		well i use to exercise regularly and i haven't lately  i have goofed off i guess um i use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work but um
 	
 	
 		oh oh oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess my job change my husband's job change and it's just not easy to get up early in the morning any more so um
 	
 	
 		oh i understand that
 		i've never been able to do it before
 	
 	
 		no  well the problem is that i am so tired at the end of the day i just wanna go home and not do anything so yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i am too i just make myself i get up at five thirty and i am at school at seven thirty and  school isn't over until uh four
 	
 	
 		well
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and our class but it's in the building that is the big difference because
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there are other people around said uh you'd better hurry go get dressed you know there is motivation around there and then uh we can we can change right there in the building i don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  yeah
 	
 	
 		and i just go and we all exercise and until then you know i have belonged to exercise clubs and oh i've gone to uh  oh like um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh these gyms you know that that like in Plano or Richardson or and uh where they offer the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh rec centers really where they offer aerobics and i've done that before but it always had to be late at night
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		after i've got home and after dinner and you are just kind of going ugh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i have tried it immediately after school like try to get some place and exercise from five to six but then by the time you get home and you fix dinner you are eating so late
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right that's difficult really is
 	
 	
 		it is it's really hard with our life style when you work um
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i know well i know some people go during lunch but you know by the time i i get over the gym and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and go to my class and shower and get back to work it's probably two hours or more and that's just too long so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i have twenty five minutes for lunch
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah that doesn't really do it does it  yeah
 	
 	
 		that's out for me
 		no i don't think so
 		but uh and they're nice because if we are running late it usually uh if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late they kind of wait on us you know because they know we are in the building and coming
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well that good
 	
 	
 		whereas and uh another place you are paying a lot more money and uh it it they're gonna to start whether you are there or not i mean you know
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		so this has worked out real nicely in fact she charges us two dollars a session
 	
 	
 		well that's not much
 	
 	
 		hum-um so it's it's we like pay her for six weeks at a time because that is like a unit in uh uh school uh you know report card period and so it is like twenty four dollars every six weeks
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's not bad
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		it beats memberships at some of these clubs that's for sure  they are real expensive
 	
 	
 		you're not kidding
 		i know we belonged um  for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean we were paying a hundred dollars plus a month for our family membership and at first we used it and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they offered lots of things but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to so we decided to forget that that was just a waste of our our money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 		well we have one through work and its its probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year which isn't bad
 	
 	
 		oh no hum-um
 	
 	
 		but i uh i don't know i still just don't don't end up going because there isn't at a convenient time or i don't know something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i need to do something if only walk the dog or something i need to start doing that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it does make you feel better and the hard thing is getting going
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		and if you have somebody who will do it with you like for a long time my husband didn't want to walk because he wants to run uh jog
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he decided that uh maybe you know uh if i was you know would be willing to walk
