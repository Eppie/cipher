 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what what what do you feel do you feel that that our government uh is it possible to have an honest government or do we have an honest
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i feel that for i feel there's a lot of shenanigans going on i feel there's a lot of crookedness in it but i do feel that for the most part
 		um our government is you know trying trying to make things work the best they can um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well  uh i'm i'm i'm rather young i'm only twenty two and so  uh my knowledge is based you know mostly on what i read you know in history
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i do think based on what i read uh what i've read through uh about about our history of our government i think things are getting better
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh in the in the last maybe ten or fifteen years where
 		Americans are becoming a little more aware and uh are forcing our government to be uh on top of
 		integrity you know as an order
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right right i agree but the people are demanding that
 		that those that aren't you know that aren't either morally or or politically or
 		going to do a good job that they're they're trying to get them out of it or at least they're taking a stand
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		against it so um
 		i know  a lot of the well in our community you know the government the leaders here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i feel like they're all all real good people that are trying their best to to provide a service to the community and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		when you think that most of the most of the politicians
 		i'm i'm not really sure what the pay scales are and and how that that works but
 		um i don't agree with some of the ways that they they earn extra money on the side  you know i feel that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		that that that needs to be changed and and they should have more accounting on the different ways that they
 		they earn their money have you ever ran for a public office probably not yeah probably not being twenty two  not yet um my husband ran one time here in uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		have i
 		no not yet huh-uh
 	
 	
 		our little community and he ran you know for the town board and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we felt like it was a a real good experience i think that
 		um
 		you know when people are wanting to get involved to
 		to to make changes for the better in the community that it's
 		that's it's a good thing so
 	
 	
 		right does it worry you that um  say someone like David Duke got such such publicity during uh during his campaign and that and that now he's running for uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		thinking of running for president does that worry you at all
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that does worry me  especially when with his background you know and the people have already voted him down i i don't understand really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really his reasons for doing that i don't
 	
 	
 		uh i i don't either
 	
 	
 		i don't know what he's
 	
 	
 		i hope he doesn't know something we  or i hope yeah hope he doesn't know something we don't
 	
 	
 		really
 		that's right yeah i was i'm interested in um
 		our state is looking for a new governor and we have had oh i think the number is seven already that are running for it and this is not until next year that have put you know their hat in in in the ring to run and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and i was surprised by that because it had seemed to me like there was almost getting to be that it was hard to get people to run because of the reason that
 		you know they dredge up every single thing in your past
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean and not very many people want to lay their their whole life on the line like that and say hey i you know i've never made any mistakes and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think that would be a little bit frightening to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to be put in the public eye like that myself but we've had it here in the state a lot of people that are going to run for
 		for governor and it seems like there's a lot of people that are starting to talk about running for president again
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know when when Bush is
 		when he's finished so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um what do you think about the different you know the different formats the republican and democrat
 	
 	
 		well  uh
 	
 	
 		do you think the parties are a good thing or do you think they need to be done away with or
 	
 	
 		i'm kind of disappointed that that uh the two parties have such a stronghold in the in the nation because if if if you belong to any other party uh you know any other platform i should say uh you you're not represented
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i don't i don't belong to any particular uh platform and and i don't think i ever will but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm afraid that um
 		i think his name was Anderson was the the gentleman who ran for uh on an independent ticket against Reagan and
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh Carter  um i was real disappointed that uh uh that he didn't he didn't have a chance uh because he didn't have a platform behind him uh uh you know a group and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think that's a little bit disconcerting you know where
 	
 	
 		right
 		it is
 	
 	
 		where uh where we really really Americans don't have a voice unless they participate within one one of the two systems
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and especially where if if you don't completely agree with their platform if there's i mean there's not a lot of choice like you say and you have to have the financial support or there's just no hope and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i know that one of the judges
