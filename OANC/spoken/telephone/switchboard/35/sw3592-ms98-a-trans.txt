 
     		
 	
 		well uh down here in we've got um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		trials by uh jury in criminal cases and the sentencing can be done by the
 		jury normally although the judge can sometimes do it how do y'all do it up there
 	
 	
 		um we usually do it uh the jury comes to the verdict and then the judge does the sentencing
 		um i think the jury can recommend something but
 		in  you know in some cases like uh murder in the first degree but i the ultimate decision is the is the decision of the judge once the
 		verdict has been reached the jury's dismissed
 		and there's a separate hearing for sentencing
 	
 	
 		we've got a lot of these uh in federal court they have a uniform sentencing
 		guidelines that pretty well leave it up to the uh judge to assess the punishment in a certain range
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i think it's curious that  the sentences that are handed down are usually not served
 		i think that's a big problem with the criminal justice system but
 	
 	
 		right here in the Dallas area if you are sentenced to ten years or less to incarceration in in the uh penitentiary
 		you will never make it to the penitentiary and you'll serve about a year in the county jail and then be released because of the jail overcrowding
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i i understand the jail overcrowding issue but
 		i i think in in in that case as as as in so many all they ever do is discuss the problems and they never do anything to solve them
 		i think that's why this country's in the shape it's in now but i i don't really believe that a jury
 		should do the sentencing i think
 	
 	
 		well the judge has a better idea of what is
 		probable ranges for that particular type of offense where a jury is just doing it for one time
 	
 	
 		yeah i just don't believe that jurors have the
 		the knowledge the scope and the knowledge  to to handle the sentencing whereas the judge does
 	
 	
 		well you know in in civil cases they can have uh as few as ten of the jurors agree on a verdict but criminal normally requires unanimous
 		they might make a change on that and that might make for fewer mistrials
 	
 	
 		that's that's certainly true
 		i just i i mean i don't agree with juries doing the sentencing but i do agree with trial  trial by jury i just think that's critical
 	
 	
 		course in civil cases trial by jury doesn't necessarily work if you have a big complex uh business type case where a jury could get totally lost
 		in a lot of those cases people decide to just try the case before a judge and just not have a jury
 	
 	
 		right well i think that can that makes sense too because it looks like it would be awfully hard to pick
 		jurors that could follow something as in in a civil case i mean that was really complicated and had a lot of technical issues in it but they  there are a lot of criminal cases a lot of murder cases and
 		that  that are really very complicated and they seem to be able to get through those
 	
 	
 		and you had up there North Carolina that case of that lady who poisoning her various husbands what was it Blanchard or
 	
 	
 		Blanche Taylor Moore
 	
 	
 		Blanche yes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've we've been reading about that
 	
 	
 		yeah we uh have you have you heard about  trial that we've got going on now with the uh
 		the man that's accused of molesting twenty three children at a day care center
 	
 	
 		no i don't remember reading about that
 	
 	
 		well that's the uh that's probably one of the biggest child malestation cases in the in the nation's history
 		this man and his wife it it's a trial by jury but it's really going real ragged i don't understand how they're doing it
 		and they got they he had a hundred and seventy eight charges against him
 		and his attorney's managed to get it reduced to ninety three
 		but the jury in that case they've just absolutely sequestered them
 		nobody even unless you were paying attention at the very beginning you don't even know their names and they uh uh from what i've been reading in the paper they are the ones who are gonna
 		do the sentencing in that
 	
 	
 		we've got a case going here where a man is accused of poisoning his wife with arsenic now and the jury the case went to the jury today and the jury's deliberating right now
 	
 	
 		arsenic is uh this this Blanche Taylor Moore woman was very clever she did it very slowly over a large period a long period of time at least it was
 		it was done very slowly over a large period of time
 		and since the jury has
 		found her guilty now the judge did the sentencing in that and she's appealing but
 		i'm assuming that she's guilty because i really believe in the jury system
 	
 	
 		well the collective wisdom of the jury usually prevails
 	
 	
 		yeah hopefully they're smart enough not to be hoodwinked by
 		illegal ploys by lawyers and prosecutors
