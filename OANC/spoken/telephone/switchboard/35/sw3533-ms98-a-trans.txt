 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay Miss Nancy we should be in business now did you hear the questions that the lady uh brought up
 	
 	
 		good
 		yes
 	
 	
 		such as how much time well i'll ask how much time do you spend with your children and how many do you have
 	
 	
 		we have two children they're both grown and married and with we have uh our daughter has three sons so we see them at least once a week and we see our son and his wife  um
 		about every other week and uh we babysit quite frequently so we're a fairly close-knit family we're together a lot on special days and uh and of course with the holidays and everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		well you're very fortunate uh my  my uh i have two girls and a son and my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam Holland
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		she's her husband builds pianos so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them as much as we'd like to because we've we one thing we do have together is we're both musicians i play in several symphony orchestras and she is uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yes
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a a concert uh harpsichordist and travels around good bit in Europe
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh her husband builds forte pianos which are harpsichord sized pianos
 	
 	
 		pianos uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh that's why they're over there and then i have a a son who lives in um  Warrington Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i get to see him maybe once every three months so i really we've lost
 		you know i'd like to have an everyday contact with children uh as as well as you do for that matter and my youngest my youngest daughter lives in New Jersey and so they
 	
 	
 		oh you don't get to see any of yours very often
 	
 	
 		i don't hardly get to see any of them she works in these um  Trump type casinos she and her husband both do they work uh they're really both um
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		play people who play on stage
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they're running lights right now and audio and that thing for plays and things that go on but anyhow uh what what do you what activities do you do with your children when you are together
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh most the time well right now it's football season and our daughter is a big Cowboy fan as is our husband so my husband so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she watches that and i play with the grandchildren  i enjoy the grandchildren but now like last weekend um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there's the Soviet space exhibit is here in Dallas and it ends uh in January so she and and the three boys and my husband and i went over into Fort Worth to see the space exhibit and this Sunday
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		the Soviet space exhibit my goodness i would am surprised they would bring anything over here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah it's
 		oh it's been here for quite some uh some time i think it came here in either September or October
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		and it's very interesting very interesting and it's been very well done uh and this uh next Sunday they're coming over after the Cowboy game and uh uh we're going to go take the boys to see Christmas lights and go to a Santa's village
 	
 	
 		i'll bet why
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh then when our son's over we have a pool and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends and we have cookouts on Sunday uh and uh
 	
 	
 		well that sounds like you have really wonderful activities that keep you together yeah
 	
 	
 		we we do a lot with with our kids and we we always have we've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger uh we're very family oriented we um
 	
 	
 		well that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		we like being with our kids and the kids seem to enjoy being with us and their friends enjoy being with us so which that keeps us very very young with all these young people passing in and out and eating and seems like i've
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		the only problem is it keep you pretty busy keeping everything going doesn't it
 	
 	
 		well it does  i'm worried about Christmas Christmas Eve
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they all pass through and then they all end up spending the night Christmas Eve night so that we open our presents on Christmas day and they go out to the other you know the in-laws in between some of this but they're all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		beautiful
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with us and uh then have Christmas dinner with us and then go to other in-laws and in things so we see a lot of them but we enjoy Christmas Eve night because
 		they all start arriving by about eleven o'clock and we open presents about five o'clock Christmas morning and you know and uh then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i go to the kitchen and cook and my sister and and her husband are coming down so there's gonna be eleven of us
 	
 	
 		that's great there was a question the question now to ask is it difficult to find time and you seem to be making out all right
 	
 	
 		for Christmas
 		yeah sometimes i'm a little exhausted  but
 	
 	
 		well tell me what what do you think of uh of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth
 	
 	
 		oh i think i think the trends are going back to spending more time with families i think parents are definitely uh spending more and more time i don't think they're leaving them with babysitters uh you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think i think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there for about uh i don't know eight or nine years
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal parents kind of went and did their thing kids did their thing and uh
 	
 	
 		well that's no that's exactly what i was gonna say if of of because i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in detail i know more about them and watch their growth
 	
 	
 		yes um-hum
 	
 	
 		and how they improve and and learn much more so than my own kids when when your own children are growing up you just take them for granted and you go ahead and do your thing and holler at
