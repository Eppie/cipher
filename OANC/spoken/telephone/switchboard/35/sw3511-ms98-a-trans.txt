 		um especially you know in some of the the real violent type murder and and crimes i feel like that it's a it's a justifiable punishment  do you
 	
 	
 		i certainly agree with that we have Dallas has now become one of the most
 		crime oh our crime rate has just exceeded all
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		possible goals or whatever and we keep coddling all of our our men or women incarcerated we have to have certain amount of space for them
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm with i think we just must keep this capital punishment and i don't believe keeping them on death row for four or five years is answering any of our problems
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i agree i think it just it jams up the system and you know we spend thousands and thousands of dollars keeping them there and
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and i feel that yeah it's not fair to the public and it's it i think it's a terrible shame
 	
 	
 		well it's not fair to the taxpayers
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		now do you have um what types of capital punishment do they use or in Texas what is legal
 	
 	
 		um
 		the lethal dose of uh you know slip in it i think they maybe should get back to courtyard hangings
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		no no i don't really mean that but if people could see what was really happening
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i think it would deter this more than than going in with the needle and injecting them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum  now we in Utah they have uh either the firing squad or the lethal injection are the two methods that are that are used here and i know um
 		not too long ago it's probably been two or three years now that um one of the people chose to die by the firing squad and
 		and i well i think that was the last one that died here was by the firing squad and um
 		so i know those are the two forms of punishment they use now but you know just the other day we had a uh man that was on death row for for killing his sister-in-law and her fifteen month old baby
 		and then they came just two days ago and and said that something had
 		not been done right with the trial and so now they've they've just have have to start all over again go through the same process all over again and oh i think that's ridiculous i just
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what a waste of money and time and resources and you know oh
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		since our have you ever served on a jury
 	
 	
 		no i have not
 	
 	
 		that is one of the most um
 		well i think everyone should at least once
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it was uh i've never been on capital punishment but um i wonder if these people were guilty until proven innocent if we would not gain or more from our attorneys
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i've been called to trial duty but i never they canceled it you know before i got there so i've never never had that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it certainly is a responsibility
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but i think that uh we need to demand more from our attorneys when they withhold information we have three cases going here in Dallas now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		two of them were murder the well finally the husband admitted to having smothered his wife even though he loved her dearly
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so he goes up for forty years with with a possibility of being out in ten
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the other man is charged with um poisoning his wife with arsenic
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and it was a a apparently it went on over a year they're a very wealthy family
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		oh it just
 	
 	
 		boy
 	
 	
 		it it you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you wonder why why this happens
 	
 	
 		yes well i don't know about your situation there but here in Utah they're
 		we're having to build new prisons because there is no place to put to put these inmates they're just the prisons are so full and so we're spending more and more money building new ones when when all these you know inmates are on death row and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's just you know
 	
 	
 		well we let our our previous governor wanted to put a tent uh you know just build
 	
 	
 		oh
