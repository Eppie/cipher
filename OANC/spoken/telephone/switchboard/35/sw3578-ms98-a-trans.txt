 		oh okay yeah i'm out in uh north Dallas by the Galleria
 	
 	
 		okay good
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		well did you did you hear our topic
 	
 	
 		oh capital punishment yeah uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		what do you what do you what do you feel about capital punishment
 	
 	
 		well uh i'm all for it in certain situations and if it's uh
 		you know i mean it just depends on how brutal you know the you know murderer you know just something like uh you know
 	
 	
 		sure
 		
 
 	
 	
 		who'd they execute you for few years ago i guess it was the um Ted Bundy or whatever something like that you know serial killer you know same thing that happened with um the Dahmer guy up in Milwaukee it just depends um
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you know kind of an eye for an eye i think uh if they had more of it instead of you know some of these people been on death row for fourteen fifteen years be more of a deterrent
 	
 	
 		all the people we're feeding and
 	
 	
 		right and
 	
 	
 		taking care of
 	
 	
 		probably also for uh drug uh people um pushers and stuff people something like that you know it just depends i i mean
 	
 	
 		sure
 		you know i feel sort of the same way i i think somewhere in the Middle East in one of those countries if they catch you dealing in drugs
 		they cut off your right hand
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because that's the hand you use i guess to to wipe your butt after you do your job
 	
 	
 		right you rape somebody i castrate you
 	
 	
 		right then after they catch you doing dealing if they catch that same person dealing in drugs again then they whack they take off his arm
 		so you know i bet they have a lot less problems with drug with drugs over there than we do here
 	
 	
 		uh definitely but i don't know if you i mean it's it would never come to pass like out here i mean it's just that's i mean Middle East is
 	
 	
 		no just uh the public's too sympathetic but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i don't know how old you are i'm i'm i'm fifty but i go back to where they were used to hijack a lot of planes and things like that you know i used to i had a good friend who was very vindictive but in attitude when he said you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		best way to stop this is they catch a hijacker the very next day they stand him up in front of a wall and they shoot him
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and just watch how many after that happens two or three times as far as execution wise how many planes do you think will be hijacked and he's exactly right you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know he a hijacker gets put in jail and and Lord only knows what happens he doesn't get any kind of a death
 		penalty as far as punishment or capital punishment and we feed him and clothe him and give him a probably let probably put a TV
 		probably put a TV in his cell and everything else just to
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		take care of him i guess
 	
 	
 		uh probably living better in in jail than he would be if he was out on the streets or whatever you know because
 	
 	
 		oh you bet
 		bet so i believe in capital punishment and uh
 	
 	
 		i definitely agree it's just you know you just have some politicians who never let something like that happen and i mean it's just
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 		i think our state state i think the state of Texas has capital punishment
 	
 	
 		yeah they do yeah somebody just
 	
 	
 		i mean you know uh and i think the i think the punishment should fit the crime or vice versa because you know
 		a rapist goes out and for that guy to walk free if i mean he deserves to be executed as far as i'm concerned if they get the hard facts on him and he is guilty
 		i mean you know this these people there's there's there's got to be a line drawn somewhere and uh not that i'm that hardened cold and cruel but
 		there just appears do you know i listened listened to the Chief of Police of Richardson talk about four or five years ago do you know a man goes out and commits robbery not capital punishment and not capital crime but robbery
 		he get and he gets caught and gets sentenced to say eight years seven to ten or something like that you know he gets five days credit for everyday he serves it's like a bonus for God's sake
 	
 	
 		hm
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's the damndest thing i ever heard of you get five days credit so if you if you uh get a sentence of five to seven as far as time served in one year you're eligible for parole
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah there's
 	
 	
 		that's ridiculous
 	
 	
 		yeah there um i don't know i mean
 		there's just so many there's just so many problems right now that i mean capital punishment is just icing on the cake
 		it's just just at that point i mean the person whoever's done that you know killed someone has probably done
 		that's got a uh police block that's probably a mile long you know that led up to something like that that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true i'm surprised there's not more vigilante cases you know i really am and there's probably a a lot more me know about because they're never they're never found out about but
 	
 	
 		um-hum  but um
 		i totally agree it's just you know i
 		God i'm sure some
 		pray to God never happen that that never happens but somebody you know killed a friend of mine or something and you the first thing you'd wanna do is kill them you know but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well you know what if someone you've
 	
 	
 		you just can't go out and you know shoot someone but
 	
 	
 		you bet or what if you're my age and your your daughter was raped by someone you know who did it oh gosh you know that would be a tough time holding any father in his right mind down
 	
 	
 		ah exactly
 	
 	
 		i guess like a you don't like to think about things like that but it's
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i'm in the uh the hunting type business so i sell firearms so it's different it's different for me because i know a lot of the product i sell goes for personal and you know in home protection
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
