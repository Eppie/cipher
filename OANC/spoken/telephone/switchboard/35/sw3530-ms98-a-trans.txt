 		um
 		we we take books every once in a while in our Sunday school class and go through them um
 		i love Scott Peck and his Road Less Traveled

 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		so i do more work kind of related reading than uh just for enjoyment
 	
 	
 		i i try to keep a book going all the time uh
 		i try to read when i first wake up in the morning and then before i go to sleep so i probably get oh thirty to fifty pages a day read
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		and i just you know i don't feel like
 		in in fact this morning i was almost late for work because i'm almost at the end of this book and i didn't wanna put it down
 	
 	
 		oh i've had them like that before too

 		so or he he's a lawyer who no longer practices but his are all have some part of the law uh enveloped in them
