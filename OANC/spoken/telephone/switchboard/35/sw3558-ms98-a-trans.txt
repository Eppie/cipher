 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've never been to Iowa what is it like up there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um well we just moved here and um
 		the only places we've gone to for a short like one day vacation was we went to Lake MacBride which is  like two or three miles north of Iowa City and it's
 		like a big park and um there have a they have a beach side and a lake side and so just depending on what type of
 		uh you know water i guess you're used to and i'm used to the beach so we went to the beach side  because i'm really from California
 	
 	
 		oh is that what you moved from California to Iowa
 	
 	
 		well we moved to California and then i uh went to school in Utah and i got married in Utah and then we
 		um lived there for a little while and then we came to Iowa
 	
 	
 		what what part of California did you live in
 	
 	
 		uh Santa Anna
 		it's near Anaheim
 		Disneyland
 	
 	
 		yes i've been i've been to Anaheim
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really close to there we see the fireworks from our upstairs window
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've i've been to Disneyland
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and to see the um Queen what is it the Queen Mary at Long Beach and Universal Studios i've been to that part of the world
 	
 	
 		uh-huh in Long Beach uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i've never been to Utah though what's Utah like
 	
 	
 		well Utah actually is
 		um one of the dryer states but it actually has some really nice scenery and um
 		have you heard of Bryce Canyon  or Zion National Park
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes yes that's supposed to be really pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah and um  they have a lot of good skiing up there and they have um Park City and
 		um
 		what else they have over there i don't really ski but i just have heard that it's really good skiing over there
 	
 	
 		have you have you ever been to Texas
 	
 	
 		um we went there for a conference we went to we stayed in Houston for a couple days and then we visited a cousin in Dallas just for a day you know and
 		we went to the Southfork Flea Market  or the one in Southfork or you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah this is this is a big state we've got it differs so much whether you're in the south or north or east or west because it's so huge
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		have you ever done any traveling up the east coast
 	
 	
 		um
 		we've only been to the east coast like once
 	
 	
 		have you been to New England
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		well New England is really pretty all times of year but
 		even when the leaves aren't growing in the fall it's really pretty in the in the summer time because there's a lot of interesting things up there
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they've got a lot of historical things a lot of cities that have been around three hundred and fifty years and
 		and um or longer and have a lot of recreation of Colonial items
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that would be a neat place to visit because i had a cousin who went to school at
 		at uh Brandeis and he was talking about how it was pretty there and that's where he's wanted to grow um not grow but live there and he live in
 	
 	
 		where is this now
 	
 	
 		New York um he was going to school in Massachusetts and he wanted to stay on the east coast because of the surroundings and the historical part of it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well i've been to Massachusetts probably
 		good five times up there it's really nice
 	
 	
 		oh well that's a place that we have never been to but would like to go to because you know just all the historical things and
 	
 	
 		well it'd probably be better in the summer time when it's warm
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh is it humid there
 	
 	
 		um i don't remember it being humid not in the summer anyway
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		the temperatures are mild normally it's in the eighties low eighties
 	
 	
 		oh hum  um another i guess place to vacation is um we traveled
 		up the  California coast and we went and visited Hearst Castle and
 	
 	
 		oh i've been to Hearst Castle
 	
 	
 		
 
 		was gonna go in up you know one on one and things like that and it's really pretty up there because you're right on the coast
 	
 	
 		i made it as far as Hearst Castle but i didn't go any farther
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		did you go up beyond Hearst Castle
 	
 	
 		yeah just a little bit beyond
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then um we had to take the five the rest of the way up because car trouble but we our destination was Washington and when we got up to Washington we thought it was really pretty because all the
 		trees line the highways and
 	
 	
 		did you
 	
 	
 		and that's how it is in Oregon too
 	
 	
 		did you go through the Redwood Forest
 	
 	
 		no we didn't have time but that we've seen pictures of it i think that'd be nice to go there
 	
 	
 		huh
 		i've been through there those trees are huge
 		you can drive a car through one of those trees it's so big
 	
 	
 		wow that  yeah i wish we could go and see that some time
 	
 	
 		there's a there's a lot in the area
 		what what else is up in Iowa
