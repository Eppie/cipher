 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you think about AIDS research
 	
 	
 		well AIDS is a nasty terrible disease and you die from it so i think that uh they need to look into it and it's kind of like cancer i don't you know how
 		many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer i think it'll probably be as difficult
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh how about yourself
 	
 	
 		um well i'm
 		certainly in favor of AIDS research and i think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does i think that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because besides the fact that
 		it's a deadly disease that it's a contagious disease so that it's
 		um although it is not killing that many people now it still
 		has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem
 	
 	
 		yeah they say a million people are infected with the HIV virus and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah i think
 	
 	
 		that's in the world or in America you
 	
 	
 		uh in the country America
 	
 	
 		oh really hm that's whose figure is that
 	
 	
 		yeah and they they have millions
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i've just heard it on the radio sometimes you hear things that on the radio that  you know could be true or couldn't be
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh do you feel like
 		this is a i guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh do you think they should spend more
 	
 	
 		um
 		i
 		i think they should actually although probably perhaps not a an incredible amount more than what they're doing and i don't necessarily
 		think that they should  uh fund AIDS AIDS research and you know in the process neglect cancer research or whatever
 		i think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general
 	
 	
 		what do you think Doug of Mister Johnson
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		magic
 	
 	
 		what right uh
 		well i am sorry that he has the virus
 		i'd
 		um
 		i don't know i don't
 		i think it's very strange that  the media hasn't um questioned him  more strongly to
 		you know about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that
 		as they probably would for a lot of other people
 	
 	
 		do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of other a bunch of the media
 	
 	
 		um
 		well
 		not not really though i mean i think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		his position but i don't think it's
 		anything exceptional that he's doing it's  what many people have done already who are just less famous
 	
 	
 		you know i took advantage of the opportunity when you know he came out i i talked to my kids about it you know it's something that i hadn't done hadn't done before uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh well that's good
 	
 	
 		i'm glad that Mister Johnson's changed his tune on uh safe sex to abstinence or i i was glad he did that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for young kids because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh let's see what are some of the other questions
 		i you don't
 		uh let's see
 		i don't have any friends that have the disease i guess you might might not
 	
 	
 		um yeah i do my cousin does for instance
 	
 	
 		is it pretty nasty
 	
 	
 		and um yeah yeah it is he's actually um
 		he had AIDS related complex for a while and he is now in full blown AIDS and really not doing very well
 		and has various
 		brain tumors and
 		that sort of thing
 		so that it's it's a very nasty thing
 	
 	
 		yeah it sound awful
 		is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly and
 	
 	
 		um yeah that's that's basically it that
 		um
 		the immune system can
 		at first slow down and you know the white blood cell count goes down which is and that's AIDS related complex but then
 		when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom that's AIDS
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		and in that case you know people are prone to getting any kind of you know weird cancer that only animals got before and yeah that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		oh really
