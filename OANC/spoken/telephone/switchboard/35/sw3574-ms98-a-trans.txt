 
     		
 	
 		being up up there maybe maybe you guys don't have as uh big a problem with air pollution as many do you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we we we have a terrible air pollution problem
 	
 	
 		do you really
 	
 	
 		our summers are extremely uh hazardous and during ah certain
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		wind directions because we get the uh Gary Indiana Chicago pollution
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze uh coming up along the lake
 	
 	
 		that's horrible
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they do post uh uh warnings for people who have uh heart diseases or respiratory problems
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		during that summer season in the winter it's not as severe
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the state of Wisconsin as a matter of fact uh started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		ah i don't think it's gonna go very far but it it was uh a way of ah triggering uh awareness
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so what's the conditions like in Dallas
 	
 	
 		well uh in Dallas i i haven't seen air pollution quite on a quite on a level that we had in Denver uh i grew up in Denver and and i've lived there most of my life and
 		we used to have those uh you know the posted warning days uh however in Colorado now
 		they have the emissions control law which has really cut down probably only once
 		every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post post warnings now you know as far as health concerns uh due to that emissions the the emissions uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh control on the vehicles seems that all of our all of our ah smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry
 	
 	
 		
 
 		Wisconsin has a a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're tested for uh their pollution control equipment
 		and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it's it is drivable
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so they've they've tried to do a lot of that and i you know uh there seem to be  at at least in certain little pockets and we were talking earlier about Madison
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Madison has one of the nicest uh bike uh road uh sharing programs of of any city in Wisconsin
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		in all of Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of uh bike trails for recreational use of any of the states
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there is a a real promotion of of biking
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um there are still a lot of people who'll insist on on driving their own automobiles uh to go everywhere
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i find that a little irritating because i don't think it's always so necessary
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah it it becomes it uh maybe to you and i who have grown up in some in some uh
 		uh some more uh beautiful parts of the country uh i think that that uh we become a little more aware uh rather quickly of
 		of what's happening with air pollution and how uh how horrible it really is um i i notice people in Dallas seem to say well sure there's air pollution but you know
 		really how bad is how problem how bad could this problem really be um
 	
 	
 		send send them to Wisconsin and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		uh the uh acid rain and they'll they'll they may wake up you know how would you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of the acid rain
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		um you right
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's a really a serious issue for those of us up in this ah sector up up here
 	
 	
 		do you find that um or or do you hypothesize that that most of the uh smog or or air pollution comes from vehicles or does it come mostly from industry up there
 	
 	
 		i think it's mostly vehicles although  it does come from some of the industry of of the Gary area
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i don't know exactly where it emerges from when it it's up in the ah northern sectors of Wisconsin that causes the acid rain
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that i'm a little uncertain of but i do know that uh it is a problem
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i had talked with my parents i i grew up uh i was born in uh Muncie Indiana and and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute and i had asked them before uh i went back to visit
 		recently about a year ago and i asked them i said did you ever realize the air pollution that was
