 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well um i kind of like the 49ers
 		
 
 	
 	
 		San Francisco
 	
 	
 		right how about you
 	
 	
 		be
 		i'm a i'm a a die hard Dallas fan
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		i was born and raised here so i i have to back my team
 	
 	
 		well yes i guess that that's understandable um
 	
 	
 		why are you a 49ers fan
 	
 	
 		well they have a couple players they have had and they do now that that um played here in Utah at BYU before they went down there
 		um Steve Young was from BYU and uh Jim McMahon was he's not he's not one of my favorite players personality or otherwise but  he did play here so that you know provides a little bit of interest
 		um how about you what are who are some of your
 		favorite players
 	
 	
 		well there's a lot of them there's uh Michael Irwin that's uh making making a real real good name for himself this year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		Troy Aikman
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know if you ever heard of him
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		well do you watch football
 	
 	
 		well not too much i i follow mostly you know the college the college ones around here rather than the the professional
 	
 	
 		not too much
 		oh really
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you know you'll  well who do you think's going to go far this year
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's it's it's pretty it's pretty tough i'm i'm i don't follow the other divisions that that much it's i have a hard enough time just keeping up with Dallas and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		the uh conference they're in right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i think Dallas will do pretty good i don't i don't know if they'll go all the way
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they're probably they they they may be another year away from going all the way
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but they'll they'll be in the play-offs and i think they'll do real good
 	
 	
 		well good what do you think about how much the football players make
 	
 	
 		that's a
 	
 	
 		professional football players
 	
 	
 		well uh that's i wouldn't mind wouldn't mind getting some of their salaries
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right do you do you think they they should be paid that much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		i think they earn it i think they earn it i mean i i mean i you'd have to pay me that much to get out there on the field to uh
 	
 	
 		you think
 	
 	
 		you know get the crap knocked out of me so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well what about um yeah i guess the risk of injury that they go through i mean they get injured it's pretty much for life in that
 		that kind of a thing do you play football do you
 	
 	
 		i did i i just i just coach coach my son right now so
 	
 	
 		oh i that's what i was would do you let your sons play
 	
 	
 		yeah i do i mean i i let them do whatever they want to do i don't i don't hold them back i mean if they want to try it and uh do it that's fine if they don't want to do it that's fine i mean i i leave them leave it up to them
 	
 	
 		as dangerous as it is
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh have
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		because i don't want to hold them back from trying anything i mean they may be may be good at it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right they might be they might be
 		making one of those salaries one of these days  huh okay well um
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		let's see what else do you have any other teams that you follow at all besides Dallas or
 	
 	
 		no not really not really
 	
 	
 		that keeps you keeps you going
 	
 	
 		yeah that keeps me busy enough right there do you think San how do you think San how's San Francisco doing this year
 	
 	
 		do you
 		well oh they're doing so-so they
 		they uh their main quarterback was hurt and so um
 		Steve Young's been uh you know in there taking his place but i think i think the main one's getting
 		better so he you know they can get back in the
 	
 	
 		is McMahon the head quarterback lead quarterback
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		isn't he playing for San Francisco
 	
 	
 		yeah he is i think he is yeah he is and then um Steve Young was and and he hurt his knee McMahon hurt his knee and so the first couple of games
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Steve Young went in for him
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought i
 	
 	
 		but i think he's back in there now
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought at first Steve Young started out as a lead quarterback and then he got himself hurt and McMahon came in in one of the games and uh ended up just uh winning the game coming from behind
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i don't
 	
 	
 		and they just let him keep starting because he was doing so good and kept winning
 	
 	
 		well he yeah so he was better because i think he was here at the first of the season and then yeah that that probably happened so do you watch it Monday nights is that what you do on Monday nights is watch the football games
 	
 	
 		uh sometimes it depends yeah it depends on what it what all's going on sometimes i sometimes i get a chance to sometimes i don't
 	
 	
 		sometimes
 		and who
 		uh-huh oh so well when you coached your son's team did you enjoy that
 	
 	
 		yeah enjoyed it a lot i mean this this is my first first year as a coach
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		his first year of playing my first year as a coach so it was a it was a learning experience on both ends
 	
 	
 		oh
