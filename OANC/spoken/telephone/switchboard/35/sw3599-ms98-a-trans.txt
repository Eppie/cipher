 
     		
 	
 		up in New York
 	
 	
 		
 
 		freezing
 	
 	
 		is it dry or wet
 	
 	
 		um it's
 		um it's it's been pretty dry yeah it it rained but we had a problem with a little bit of a water shortage but it rained for a bit but the last about three four days i guess you probably had a cold front last week
 		but uh they said that it was coming across the country but the last few days has been like really cold it was down to about thirteen degrees
 		um yesterday morning when i woke up it's starting to warm up a little bit now but we haven't got any snow yet just a couple of sprinkles here and there
 	
 	
 		well we haven't had cold weather we've just had rain and rain and more rain
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		this is our third consecutive day of rain and the weather man is promising us at least four more days of rain
 	
 	
 		is it you say in Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah in Dallas and we're on the verge and it's going to happen either today or tomorrow of setting an all time record for most rain in a year
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		our normal rainfall is twenty nine inches and we're already up to over fifty inches
 	
 	
 		wow that's wild
 	
 	
 		and it's and it's coming down and coming down it's
 		it is been raining all year at an incredible pace
 	
 	
 		that's pretty wild
 	
 	
 		i know we're about to float away
 	
 	
 		it's usually pretty i guess twenty nine is pretty dry it's Dallas is kind of in the desert huh
 	
 	
 		well it's not really in desert the desert
 		starts
 		about fifty miles west of here is where the desert sort of starts
 		but twenty nine inches is is our normal we have very
 		dry summers
 		and uh spring time is usually fairly wet but this time of year is fairly dry and we're having
 		spring time rain right now
 	
 	
 		well how how cold has it been
 	
 	
 		oh it's uh pretty warm it's about fifty three degrees or so
 		uh so it's not cold but it's just wet
 	
 	
 		yeah i lived in Oregon for three years so i know what that's about
 	
 	
 		what is it warm but wet up there
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to it wasn't super warm during the winter it would be you know forty five fifty degrees most of the time but always a sprinkling type rain
 		uh in New York you get when it rains you get like real showers sometimes you never got that out there  but uh
 		but here it it  it rains about forty i guess about forty two forty two inches a year yeah i know we had a little bit of a a drought this year as a matter of fact because the water supply in our reservoirs was a little low
 	
 	
 		well we're not having any problem like that the last time we had drought around here was nineteen eighty when we really got very little rain but since then it's been normal and then this is about the fourth year in a row where we've had above average rain
 		last year we had about forty five inches and
 		which is well above and now what we're having this year so it's been tremendous rainfall
 	
 	
 		does it do any damage i mean you have floods or anything like that or
 	
 	
 		uh some areas have had some flooding the worst flooding occurs in the spring time when some when our main river around here the Trinity River goes over its banks and
 		causes damage but uh for the most part they've been trying to deal with that
 		although the traffic is horrible
 	
 	
 		when it rains
 	
 	
 		when it rains oh yes everything comes to a a standstill with the rain this morning it took me thirty minutes extra to get to work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i found that i used to commute i used to live in New York City and commute out to Long Island which is in the suburbs and uh it was normally about an hour and fifteen minutes hour and a half drive it'd take
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there was really a lot of traffic but it was like pretty good flowing traffic and then it would get really bad when when it rain  together you know takes whatever
 	
 	
 		is your is your weather now normal for this time of year or is it different
 	
 	
 		uh yeah it's pretty normal today is pretty normal today it's probably about  thirty thirty five degree well maybe thirty degrees out now and it's supposed to go up to forty and then that's about normal we don't
 		we don't usually stay below freezing uh for long periods of time
 		uh you know we have cold spells that that happen but but aside from that usually the temperature probably average temperature is thirty five forty degrees during the winter so this is kind of normal
 	
 	
 		well we had we had early freezes here we had our
 		a normal freeze is around November twentieth and we had our freeze this year on November second and between the second and the tenth of November in those eight days we set record lows six of eight days
 		and so we thought we were going to really have a cold winter but since then it's the temperatures have been normal it's just that the rain has been incredible
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what happened here last year we had we had uh a lot of cold early on and then it and then the winter was relatively mild i think they i think it's going to be a cold winter this year though because of that volcano in uh
 	
 	
 		oh in the Philippines
 	
 	
 		in the Philippines that's supposed to like cover up the uh or rather raise the warming layers and stuff like that so it's probably going to be a couple degrees cooler
 	
 	
 		well i don't know what i don't know if that volcano caused all this rain but something's been causing all this rain
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		it could it could it could cause rain i'm not sure but
