 
     		
 	
 		okay Jerry the uh topic was favorite TV shows and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what kind are you interested in and how they and do they differ from like mine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well okay uh most of most of the uh commercial television these days i'm just a little bit sick of
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh in fact i don't watch hardly any uh television at all with uh my other activities uh
 		between my family and my church et cetera et cetera why i don't have any time uh hardly any time to sit down and watch the news now i do watch the Discovery Channel and some on channel thirteen but aside from
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh do you yeah
 	
 	
 		aside from that i pretty well uh turn it off
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sort of a well i'm different from that i'm sort of a a movie buff i go to a  a couple of movies movies a week sometimes quite honestly i'm i'm self-employed and a lot of times i will uh go out and take
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a lunch hour and go to lunch from like twelve to two and go to a movie and just come back to my office
 	
 	
 		i don't blame you
 	
 	
 		but uh i do it it's like entertainment i'm pretty much of a a junk movie watcher by myself if i take my wife then we see something a little nicer you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh and my kids are all sort of movie watchers you know we've we've always been to a lot of we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life
 		so but i would just as soon uh be doing something else it's just that
 		my kids are gone now and
 		and my wife's a school teacher and sometimes  she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock so you know i'll come in like five thirty or six and i'll turn on the tube and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little TV and sometimes i set there all evening
 	
 	
 		yeah i i well if sometimes if if it's real good like there's more than been there's been more than one evening that i've uh caught uh every animal show that evening on uh on the Discover Channel
 	
 	
 		you bet you bet
 	
 	
 		and uh because they're uh
 		they're they're you you know they're documentaries and they're
 	
 	
 		well that's an interesting channel
 	
 	
 		oh you bet in fact i'm glad that it's part of our ah basic cable package
 	
 	
 		well that's great you know i've i've just never spent any time watching it and you know
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i like my sports and everything but i
 	
 	
 		oh well me too hello with the
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i watched my Dallas Cowboys i watched them to halftime before i left and i left at halftime and started drinking driving
 	
 	
 		well they they whooped
 		they whooped up on them
 	
 	
 		they sure did they just did an excellent job
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and they're in the play-offs and uh i'm not sure that the Eagles are or not
 	
 	
 		yeah the Eagles you have to laugh the luck into it now i think but the Cowboys they earned it on their own merit
 	
 	
 		i did
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		and you know everybody or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson but uh
 		he's uh
 		he's brought the pokes uh from a a one and something team to a play-offs in what three years now
 	
 	
 		you you bet as much as everyone you know and use the word love Tom Landry you know i'm glad that Jimmy Johnson's there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well it's uh you know it was a time for the passing of the guard i mean and i think Tom knew it
 	
 	
 		it was
 		i think so too he wanted to go out a winner though i think he would've stayed there four or five more years so he could have gone out a winner
 	
 	
 		so um
 		yeah that's true and i wouldn't i wouldn't have blamed him one bit because
 	
 	
 		no no it's you know he earned those stripes
 	
 	
 		yeah but see nobody remembers him as a loser
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		because he's too he's too far he's far too much of a gentleman and a and a practicing Christian to uh to ever be thought of as anything but a loser you know but a winner
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		you bet he's a he's a winner in anyone's book and i hope he's a winner in his own book you know because that that's the key there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh he is he is
 		because he has to like himself before he can like other people
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		little things that disturb me and i know he's being a little hard-nosed about it but uh you know this ring of honor thing you know he needs to be there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because he's earned it he deserves it and he was the Dallas Cowboys and he won't do that yet so i hope he makes up his mind to do it because
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh he will
 	
 	
 		he needs to be remembered
 	
 	
 		right well nobody's gonna forget Tom Landry shoot come now i mean i'm not a
 	
 	
 		no no no absolutely absolutely not oh that's true but he needs to be honored put it that way
 	
 	
 		betcha i'm i'm not a native Texan by birth but uh i guess by uh length of length of time i've been the state now is what after you're here twenty years you're considered a native
 	
 	
 		you bet i've been here since seventy four um and i feel like a native
 	
 	
 		well let's see i came down March of sixty nine went to work for T and I yeah

 		so uh i haven't looked back yet either so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and we came we came down from New York state in seventy four and uh
 		never had any regrets at all
 	
 	
 		right especially looking at some of the weather New York state has had and then look at the weather we have down here huh
 	
 	
 		you bet it's been
 		it's been a great place to raise our kids and i've got my last kid graduating from college this next December she's getting married the month before in November so i will have finished be finished  with that
