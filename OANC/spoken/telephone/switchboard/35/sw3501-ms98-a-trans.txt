 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um we have two pets at the moment we have a cat and we also have a bird that's a strange combination  i visit the cat is an an outdoor cat and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um we've had him for four years it's really a good cat when we first talked about getting one my husband isn't really fond of cats and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we went ahead and got this one for my little girl from her great-grandma and it's turned out to be a very good pet she or he is
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um you know he stays outside he doesn't try and come in the house and trip you up and he just he's almost like a dog our cars will come down the road and and the cat will come running out from
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		the fields we live in quite a rural little community and and he comes running he can hear our car  so he is more more you know like a dog it's really a good animal
 	
 	
 		oh
 		does your cat try to run away at all
 	
 	
 		no we haven't had a bit of problem with that the only um
 		incident we had about like that was when he was just a kitten um on Halloween we lost track of him and i don't know whether he followed some trick-or-treaters or you know they scared him or what but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he uh was gone and we thought for sure he was gone and he was gone three weeks and then he yes and then he came back and he had a crooked paw so apparently he had
 	
 	
 		three weeks
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah apparently he had broken his foot somehow but he did come back so
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		yes yes and how about you
 	
 	
 		we have a dog
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we have a three year old dog it's about medium size and she's uh an indoor dog
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		oh fun
 	
 	
 		and she is yeah she's like our baby
 	
 	
 		oh now is it is that's that's not still considered a puppy
 	
 	
 		not technically we consider her a puppy i she still acts like a puppy but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you oh real active and
 	
 	
 		yeah oh very
 	
 	
 		oh what's oh what's her name
 	
 	
 		too active
 		Sam Samantha
 	
 	
 		oh oh that's that's a nice name we um our cat is named
 		we named it Duchess and then we found out it was a boy  but it was too late to change so  and now is is that the only pet you have
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's neat
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh the what kind of a dog is it
 	
 	
 		she's a mix between a German Shepherd and a Husky
 	
 	
 		oh pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah she is really pretty and she's a good watchdog we live in a one bedroom apartment and she will growl and bark at strangers walking by or she hears any footsteps
 	
 	
 		ah
 		uh-huh
 		oh oh that's good
 	
 	
 		yes it is good it's nice to have
 	
 	
 		boy and your apartment apparently allow they allow pets
 	
 	
 		yes we it was hard to find um apartments out here we live in uh Penn State University and it's hard to find apartments that take pets so we're way on the outskirts of town
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because and we have a ground floor apartment with like a private yard that we can just open up the door and we play Frisbee and ball and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		how nice
 	
 	
 		so that she gets some exercise we go for walks
 	
 	
 		oh boy that sounds ideal because yeah they do need especially  dogs they need to run and jump and oh well that's great i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		we had a um our little bird we've only had it for about six months and we got that for my son for his birthday and
 		it's named Buttercup a little yellow yellow parakeet  yeah they chose that and i one other pet we had had an experience with over the summer it's a kind of a funny thing we
 	
 	
 		oh that's a good bird name
 	
 	
 		my neighbor had given her children each a a a a bunny rabbit for Easter
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		yes and and then her kids had them for a couple of months and they you know kind of tired of them like kids do and and she said do you want these and
 		so we said yes we'll take them and and take care of them for a while and she said now you know when you don't want them i know a man that just loves them and he'll take them anytime you want and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we were a little bit reluctant with the cat and the bird already to take on some more  but so we took these three rabbits from them
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and about two weeks later um my son went out to feed them and and he said mom i i think the white bunny's sick
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and so yeah we went out immediately and lifted up the hutch lid and that mama rabbit the white one
 		had had eleven babies  uh yeah eleven oh so that was quite a surprise and
 	
 	
 		how many
 		oh my goodness
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so we went from three bunnies to fifteen in a matter of two weeks  but that i guess that was her first time being a mother and i i'm not real
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		knowledgeable about bunnies but they all died and i they all did and she well she didn't take care of them and i've heard sometimes that with their first their first
 	
 	
 		oh they all did
 	
 	
 		you know litter that they do that but  yeah it was it was really a really hard experience
 	
 	
 		oh that's sad
