 
     		
 	
 		okay i now say Arlington Texas since the other day i said that and somebody said well i'm in Arlington Virginia
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh  well that is a different thing isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah i was really surprised then i got one person from Utah but usually it's just right around here
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		well what what do you like in a restaurant
 	
 	
 		well i guess i'd i thought well i guess i'd have to say the food  well
 	
 	
 		i know number one that's definitely it
 	
 	
 		you know if the food's good then that's you know that sort of makes my decision i you know if i really have something good although okay the food and then the other thing i'd say is atmosphere's real important to me you know i don't like really noisy places and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you know yeah  you know i used to like to go to Friday's because i like kind of lively fun places and the last time we went there it was so horrendously noisy that i don't know if i'll ever go back it was awful
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 		well when a when a
 		i know one of my pet peeves is that you know they have the music on so loud and then people have to talk loud and then it's just so noisy that you can't visit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		you know and normally when i'm eating out i you know with people and i wanna sit and talk i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's the half the fun is the conversation right
 	
 	
 		right
 		you know and i don't mind some noise but if it's
 		bearable for me so um
 	
 	
 		i really think American restaurants are all overall getting noisy and noisy people just screaming i say that because i  the time i was in Europe years ago you could be in a tiny little restaurant everyone talked lower they still seemed to have fun
 	
 	
 		i'd
 		uh-huh well i don't know why i in fact i've been to places where i've asked them to turn the music down and and they say well they you know they can't that that's the the atmosphere they want to promote and i i don't understand that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i don't either
 	
 	
 		you know it's like that doesn't make sense to me what you know what is the fun of that
 	
 	
 		i know  i can't and uh another one you can tell i go to cheap restaurants now that i have a daughter in college and i'm going we we go all the cheapies but uh we go to Cheddar's a lot there's one by us
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they'll just blast the TV where in the bar where you have to wait till they call your name you know and and i'm not that  excited about some baseball game or whatever they're
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's just so loud you can't even visit while you're having a drink or anything
 	
 	
 		well another thing that is not my favorite thing is um  you know like if they have um
 		birthdays and then they all scream  you know  clap and scream to birthday i get tired of that too
 	
 	
 		oh they all screaming run screaming in and singing yes
 		they do too i think
 	
 	
 		so you know that that uh
 		the atmosphere does make a difference but usually i tend to go well for two reasons i go for the food also thinking now there's certain types of restaurants that i like you know like i love Mexican food and so i go to i like Mexican food restaurants um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i would go for that um i think did i say what kind of restaurants do you prefer or do you
 	
 	
 		oh golly uh i like most kinds of food really i'd never go to a barbecue place i mean i i don't mind barbecue but that's one that we just don't go out to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but what you know i like Italian and Mexican and i love French and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um we don't i don't even think we have a Greek restaurant in Arlington we uh i used to go to a Greek restaurant over in Dallas couple of them i thought they were great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i like most everything i like seafood too course it's hard to get my husband to a seafood restaurant but another thing to consider is the uh help you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh their attitude
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh uh i think and uh
 	
 	
 		i i agree
 	
 	
 		some of them you know they come up with all this phony stuff too hi my name's Bill i'm your waiter for the night oh God i'm tired of that
 	
 	
 		right right
 		right just wait on me and
 	
 	
 		right i don't care about right we don't have to exchange backgrounds but um price is something to consider
 	
 	
 		i'll be happy
 		
 
 		that's true that's true um and i and i generally speaking go to moderately priced places you know places and it does matter um
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		you know depending upon what my budget is for the week as to where i go i guess um but that's yeah that's right i uh price is definitely  a consideration
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh the more expensive the restaurant the more i want the have the waiters to really wait on you and be good you know  remember
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well they should be i mean in theory i guess
 	
 	
 		really really i think so well we went to New Orleans this fall and talk about great restaurants oh
 	
 	
 		yes there's probably no place better i i you know the food in New Orleans is just fabulous
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh i know and uh  really we we went to Commander's Palace and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you know supposed to be one of the better ones in America and uh our dinner that night you could choose one that had like four courses and it was thirty nine dollars a dinner but my gosh it was worth it it was just beautiful surrounding and at one time there was five people waiting on our table
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yes
 		yeah i've been there it yes i have
 	
 	
 		oh really that's the first time i i'd been in New Orleans before it was the first time i'd eaten there and i thought it was worth every penny
 	
 	
 		ah
 		it is it's a fabulous place
 	
 	
 		and uh i really enjoyed that then i'd enjoy that more than Brennan's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think it's better
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but still Brennan's is so lovely and the service is so wonderful
 	
 	
 		well they're all lovely i mean basically you just can't go wrong and um the food is just so good i i i i love New Orleans and i
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		oh i know and they're lighthearted people there but
 	
 	
 		exactly it's just a
