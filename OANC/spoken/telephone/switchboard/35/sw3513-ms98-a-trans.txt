 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well uh see what type of car do i want
 		well i'd like to have a Corvette
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		but my
 		uh weekly wages don't  apply for me to have that kind of car so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i'm engaged to get married so
 		i'll more likely get a car for economic reasons
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah and um
 		so uh to drive back and forth to work is all i need a car for pretty much and
 		we have a truck so probably a economic size car will work
 		um
 	
 	
 		what kind of um car do you have now
 	
 	
 		right now i have a eighty seven Cavalier
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		it's a piece of
 	
 	
 		my car is really old too because um i drive out of town a lot of the weekends and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i would like my next car to have good gas mileage
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um same here um
 		you know a nice car American made and um
 		you know and a nice car but not too expensive because um
 		i couldn't afford like a brand new like Bamorghini or something i would like to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but while we're talking right
 	
 	
 		while we're talking my next car i'd like to be sporty and you know nice but you know it's expensive and then insurance is really high for that too so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		something with a that's not too sporty because of insurance then
 	
 	
 		right that insurance does come into play i forgot about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so what kind of insurance do y'all have up there mean is it real high up there
 	
 	
 		um no mine just got lowered because i just turned twenty one and um
 		i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		really how much i pay i just
 		my mom's helping me out you know because i'm a college i'm in college and um so i just give her the money and and take her word for it
 	
 	
 		right
 		right i know insurance is high dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it is so and that the more expensive the car the higher it is so
 	
 	
 		but
 		right i mean
 	
 	
 		unless i win the lottery i won't be buying anything too expensive i don't plan on buying a car for many many years  so
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i have to make this one last as long as i can
 	
 	
 		yep
 		what's everybody drive up there
 	
 	
 		uh in Kenosha
 	
 	
 		i mean in Wisconsin they drive them little four wheelers or four wheel drive or do y'all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything
 	
 	
 		oh it just is
 		yeah we we have a Jeep with four wheel drive because um because of the snow you mean or
 	
 	
 		right it never snows down here so
 	
 	
 		well we don't have any snow here now it all melted yeah there's no snow at all
 	
 	
 		really
 		we haven't had snow yet
 		we usually only get it like once a year or so
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		kind of strange to y'all huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it is
 	
 	
 		because how it it's like seventy degrees here right now
 	
 	
 		oh don't tell me that  that's nice
 	
 	
 		yep how how cold is it there
 	
 	
 		well actually it's been warm it's in the forties
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's that's really warm
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um  and it's supposed to rain tomorrow so we  i've only seen snow once this year and
 		and it was really bad and then it all melted like within the week
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and now there's no snow so
 	
 	
 		huh
 		but  hm so what what's your dream car
 	
 	
 		um i haven't really thought about i'm not too big on cars i mean i don't know the names and stuff but if i were to go to a car lot and like look at them  i would pick out one that you know looked really nice
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		what's your favorite color
 	
 	
 		um for a car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		probably blue
 	
 	
 		blue
 	
 	
 		like if it you know was just a average middle class car but if i were to get a sports car maybe white or red or
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so what kind of car do you drive right now
 	
 	
 		um it's a Skyhawk Buick eighty three i think
 	
 	
 		really
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah oh it like eighty two thousand miles
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm afraid it's not gonna last me that long and i hope it does though
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a two door i like i i like smaller cars uh they're i find them more comfortable to drive
 	
 	
 		right so everybody have their windows tinted up there
 	
 	
 		um no i don't see too many cars tinted
 	
 	
 		everybody has their tinted down here
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure yeah i could i could see why
 	
 	
 		so you been down here before
 	
 	
 		yep um
 	
 	
 		really did you like it
