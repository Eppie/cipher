 		yes
 	
 	
 		all the uh strong R rated and my wife and i go see the the My Girls and the good ones
 	
 	
 		well i'm ready if you are
 	
 	
 		what kind movies you like
 	
 	
 		um oh you pressed one already i'm sorry okay um
 	
 	
 		yes i'm sorry course
 	
 	
 		i like most everything i'm quite fond of horror movies and science fiction uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh are you okay so am i
 	
 	
 		um what about you
 	
 	
 		well i sort of well like i like them all but i'm a you know i'm an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan a Sylvester Stallone fan and i like detective type uh mystery dramatic types
 		we saw did you have you all have you seen Cape Fear
 	
 	
 		no but it's on my list of things to see i haven't as a matter of fact i haven't seen whole lot in the last month or so but did you like it
 	
 	
 		have you okay
 		yes that's tremendous that'll  that'll be equivalent to uh Silence of the Lambs or something like that
 	
 	
 		oh did you i assume you saw that one yes i really enjoyed it i'd read the book and i thought they stayed very faithful
 	
 	
 		yes that was great
 		they did yes yes it was a great movie
 	
 	
 		did you see the original Cape Fear before you went to see the new version
 	
 	
 		no i didn't no i missed that one
 	
 	
 		i thought i might rent that um
 	
 	
 		that might be a neat idea
 	
 	
 		uh well i'll tell you something that we just saw recently that is old old but i'd never seen was Fantasia
 	
 	
 		yeah bet that was good
 	
 	
 		it was not what i expected it to be
 	
 	
 		oh no it's a tremendous movie
 	
 	
 		it was but i mean i can understand that little kids wouldn't find it um particularly appealing  it'd be way over their heads i think
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i've seen it two or three times it's such a a great movie
 	
 	
 		and the music is wonderful
 	
 	
 		yes they uh everyone my wife's a teacher and all of her teacher friends are saying we need to go see Beauty and the Beast they say that's quite a nice movie
 	
 	
 		i wouldn't mind seeing that well actually we kind of like going to see things like Bambi and such too so Beauty and the Beast would be okay with me
 	
 	
 		right
 		you bet we seen them all you see i'm such a movie buff i go out i'm self-employed so a lot of times i'll just uh
 		i just have a two person office myself and my secretary and i'll just uh go out for lunch at noon sometimes go to a movie and come back at two that kind of a thing
 	
 	
 		so how often a week do you go
 	
 	
 		oh i probably average at least
 		one and a half to two times a week
 	
 	
 		yeah see you're pretty you're pretty movie buffy i'd do that if i could
 	
 	
 		oh i enjoy it yeah i enjoy it a lot of times uh my wife will have to stayed after school till seven and i'll just uh leave the office at five and go to a movie and come home at seven and i'll be here when she gets here
 	
 	
 		have you seen the new Star Trek
 	
 	
 		no i'm a will see that though
 	
 	
 		that one and Hook looks like uh it would be good
 	
 	
 		Hook does look like it'll be good
 	
 	
 		and let's see what else is out new this year that
 	
 	
 		uh my wife and i saw My Girl and that was a good little uh that was a good little movie
 	
 	
 		it's supposed to be cute i heard it got pretty good reviews
 	
 	
 		yeah it was cute
 	
 	
 		um i was  we were a little disappointed with Home Alone which we just saw we kind of catch them sometimes when they come around on videos
 	
 	
 		sure you bet
 	
 	
 		and uh i don't know maybe we just weren't in the mood but
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a little that was a little slapstick you know yes but uh My Girl will sort of it'll bring a little tear to your eyes or something it was cute movie
 	
 	
 		kind of
 		well that's all right a lot of them do
 	
 	
 		oh i understand
 		we uh yeah we see quite a few our daughter and uh son are moviegoers and
 		future son-in-law they're all moviegoers so we've we just all go to movies
 	
 	
 		it's good entertainment especially if you go you know before the uh when the bargain matinees are
 	
 	
 		oh i think so too
 		absolutely that's what my wife and i do on Fridays you know we uh meet at five thirty and uh go to the movie and then go out and go to dinner somewhere then come home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well particularly if you see something that isn't very good you hate having wasted your seven dollars each or whatever it's up to
 	
 	
 		you bet well it's expensive to go to a movie i'll tell you
 	
 	
 		well it is particularly when you buy popcorn and everything
 	
 	
 		oh i know because we take uh so my wife and i take my son and her intended to the movie you're talking uh between tickets and popcorn and everything probably forty bucks
 	
 	
 		i'm sure i'm sure
 	
 	
 		because we go we go visit them Lubbock Texas that's where they're at going to school and there's nothing to do in Lubbock Texas but go to the movie  and you better do it before nine o'clock you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's the last show huh
 	
 	
 		right  but anyway we uh yeah we really enjoy it but trying think of another good movie i've seen lately uh
 		oh
 		i don't know i missed
