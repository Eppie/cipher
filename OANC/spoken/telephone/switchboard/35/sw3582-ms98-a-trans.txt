 
     		
 	
 		kind of younger still and we do a lot of activities with them how about your kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my children are in their late twenties and both are married and we do things as a family all together and when they were younger we were very involved in
 		Little League and Scouts and band and football and
 		things you know i have two sons things that you do together
 	
 	
 		are are your sons are your sons still live in the area
 	
 	
 		yes one lives in Plano and the other lives in Lewisville
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		with their wives
 	
 	
 		i've got one son and one daughter and i think the activities haven't changed because my son is in Scouts
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and the orchestra and the choir and
 		ballet and church activities and uh soccer and basketball and baseball and my daughter is on the swim team is in ballet
 		uh takes piano lessons is in the Girl Scouts so tends to be very busy
 	
 	
 		right well i my husband and i always felt that if you want to keep them off the street so to speak that if they're involved
 		in a smaller group type things that um  it really is wonderful as far as socializing and learning and just
 		keeping out of trouble i work at a high school and i see a lot of kids who
 		because it's a large school
 		you're just sort are a little teeny fish in a big pond here and if you belong to you know a smaller group you you
 		just have a better class of friends and and stuff and i think it's wonderful i i admire you it's a lot of time out Saturdays Sundays and nights but it it definitely is worth
 		the the time to
 		get your kids involved in in various things
 	
 	
 		well gives gives them the opportunity to uh you know to relate to other people and not only to learn a specific skill and how to apply it but but more importantly how to you know work within the uh larger context
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		right the social life  socialization is
 		is worth whatever it is they're learning and it  you know my kids never were on the championship teams they were both in the band they happened to have graduated from the school where i work and and um
 		all those things were or have served them and still are
 		you know in their adult years and in college uh you know that they just
 		they remember lots of good times and um we'd still hear frequently from
 		former teammates or band members or you know people who stop by and say hi to my husband and i and uh
 		so are you active
 		with i mean do you coach any of these things or
 	
 	
 		oh yes i coached this year i've coached soccer i've coached baseball i'm a uh assistant scout master in the Scouts i've actually
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		appeared on stage with them in their ballet performances and then a feel of things so it's a
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's it's pretty active and my wife teaches piano and she's active with the Girl Scouts so
 	
 	
 		well i'd it
 	
 	
 		takes a tremendous amount of time
 	
 	
 		it does and and um but as i say i i really feel
 		to keep them away from the bad element at school or just at the mall or wherever uh every
 		every hour pays off in the long run as far as uh
 		keeping the kids from out of trouble and and uh and i see frequently see that here just
 		because it's a high school and and uh you know kids
 		kids get in trouble there's no
 	
 	
 		well the ones in trouble the ones that are bored that's their biggest problem is boredom if they
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 		that's right they're also you know have parents that
 		either can't or don't care about their activities and don't support them and and uh
 		over the years my kids have had friends like in the band that
 		in in in three years of high school band their parents never saw a football game to watch them i think i i we never miss a game we still go and the last one graduated in nineteen eighty two so but we still
 		you know go to watch these things and and uh
 	
 	
 		well sure
 		like last night we went to hear my son play in the uh
 		orchestra then last week we heard him sing in the choir twice so you know we're
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh it's a lot of hours for a parents but as they
 	
 	
 		a lot of hours either it be helping to run things or to just sit there and listen to things
 	
 	
 		right right right but it it uh i recall my own parents being active in in my endeavors and uh you know i think
 		you you you just can't spend enough time with kids in in quality time as i like to call it and and uh
 		you know it's worth every every hour
 		every so you have two children a boy and a girl how old are they
 	
 	
 		well my son's
 		eleven my daughter's ten
 	
 	
 		okay well see mine are twenty seven and thirty so
 	
 	
 		well i've got i've got a long way to go
 	
 	
 		well start saving your money for college
