 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how many floors
 	
 	
 		sixty eight
 	
 	
 		how about do you walk up the stairs
 	
 	
 		well my doctor told me to start walking up the stairs too  i've got bad knees and he said it would it would uh do that
 		i i i enjoy going down but this going up and i'm going up about fifteen flights now
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah i i just started going up
 	
 	
 		yeah well i worked in a building that was
 		and i worked on the eighth eighth floor or tenth i can't remember anyway i walked up the stairs every day but like three times a day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's really i think it's great for you and if you got to get there it's not so for me it's not so much of a chore
 	
 	
 		well i don't think i could walk up sixty eight flights of stairs
 	
 	
 		well they have that vertical marathon in uh i think it's in March where they do go up the stairs of this building
 	
 	
 		that building is sixty eight floors
 	
 	
 		oh no it's seventy one
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		but we're on the sixty eighth floor
 	
 	
 		gee
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and so they have a vertical marathon they have a race and they have people that can walk go up sixty eight or what seventy one flights as quickly as i can go down them
 	
 	
 		golly
 	
 	
 		and
 		and i go at a pretty good clip
 	
 	
 		well do you do anything outside in the summertime
 	
 	
 		going down
 		i run i do a lot of races uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know the and usually just the five K uh i hope to do the capital ten thousand this spring though
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i haven't done a ten K in a couple of years but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh i like to run i just don't like being outside in the winter i don't like
 	
 	
 		the wind
 	
 	
 		yeah the cold and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just
 	
 	
 		well in the summer time i love to bicycle i love i take my bicycle to White Rock Lake i ride around the lake i love it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i want to start riding around there i don't have a bicycle but
 		but uh
 		i i wouldn't mind that
 	
 	
 		i have a bad i have a bad foot so whenever i i'm on my foot a lot it starts hurting me so i can't do much on my feet
 	
 	
 		how would you do aerobics
 	
 	
 		i do i make sure that my foot is flat on the floor when i bring it down
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i just can't do anything on my toes because i hurt my foot
 		so i just i do the best i can
 	
 	
 		that's kind of
 	
 	
 		i just have to make sure that foot that heel is down flat
 	
 	
 		that's why i don't do aerobics is it's too iffy for the knees
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i've got that's
 		that's been my worse problem is the knee injury
 	
 	
 		but i think that uh exercise i think everyone needs exercise
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 		if i didn't if i didn't do this i uh  we've got a woman in our office that weighs three hundred pounds
 	
 	
 		you right right
 	
 	
 		and she can't walk she can't do things that she can't do the things that you would just do not even think about doing like walk couple of blocks down the street to go to the store
