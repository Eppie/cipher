 
     		
 	
 		you've done
 	
 	
 		
 
 		our most recent uh
 		in series of projects i guess was inside was uh we remodeled the bathroom recently
 	
 	
 		and how did it go
 	
 	
 		well it went pretty well um other than the fact that we encountered some uh problems that you run across in older homes with uh plumbing
 		which one thing led to another
 		and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes
 		from the sink clear back to the main drain which meant you need take the wall out and start all over
 	
 	
 		jeez it's like starting over i guess
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it wasn't one of those
 		it started out as a Sunday project and by the by the next Sunday it was done it wasn't a one-dayer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  and it
 		
 
 		boy that sounds like uh course uh i don't know once you get it done then you probably won't have that problem again
 	
 	
 		believe me
 		yeah it's good for another thirty years
 	
 	
 		um it you've got an older house
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		they uh built a little bit more sturdy than
 	
 	
 		well that's the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		everything in there was copper and it was all soldered
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		that's what drove me bananas because you know i'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and cement
 	
 	
 		and it's all been so
 	
 	
 		to fit them together and nothing wanted to go so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over
 	
 	
 		and just start at square one
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		that was an all day job just to get it plumbed
 	
 	
 		well and then if you do it wrong
 	
 	
 		fortunately i was very fortunate uh in the fact that uh when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked
 	
 	
 		everything went all right
 	
 	
 		everything worked and i just said that's marvelous i appreciate it
 	
 	
 		that's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happen
 	
 	
 		well i expected something to leak you know left a fitting loose or didn't use Teflon tape on one or something like that
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it all came together so i i felt pretty fortunate about that
 	
 	
 		all worked out all right huh
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well um ah probably the last thing i did was uh paint and wallpaper kids room
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i learned uh i used the wrong kind of paint this wasn't must have not been a very good quality because it just hasn't
 		stood up very well
 	
 	
 		what kind of paint
 	
 	
 		it was a latex plaint paint it was flat and i wonder if maybe i should've used the gloss
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but they say you uh use your gloss mainly in your
 		kitchens and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that and semigloss for trim work and usually flat for walls
 	
 	
 		yeah but i think maybe uh i don't know if it was just the
 	
 	
 		was it not washable paint
 	
 	
 		well it it is a latex paint but it just kind of is so you know so it's supposed to wash you're supposed to be able to wash it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it um just looks dingy i don't know how else to explain it just it's pink
 	
 	
 		what color is it
 		pink okay
 	
 	
 		it's kind of got uh
 		oh just kind of a worn look to it i don't even even know how to say  just didn't turn out quite as nice as i would have liked but
 	
 	
 		did you uh require more than one can of paint
 	
 	
 		we put two coats on it and it's a small room but i think it only took one uh can
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you didn't have to mix paint then right
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		we did uh
 		oh you do mix the color as far as
 		you start with uh white and then they add the color you know what i'm saying but
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		yeah but you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes right and then i wallpapered a couple of walls and uh
 	
 	
 		how'd that go
 	
 	
 		well that was the first time i've ever wallpapered and uh  that's a an education in itself
 	
 	
 		kind of fun isn't it
 		really
 	
 	
 		but uh the dye lots uh must have been a little bit different from first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if you're trying to match a design and i
 	
 	
 		repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you when you buy your paper
 	
 	
 		yes that's what i needed and i didn't think about that i got a Mickey Mouse print is what i got and so a lot is wasted
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats
 	
 	
 		so you'd know how i see i didn't even think to look for that  and then the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		one of them was just a  different color different color pink is what it ended up being
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and i
 	
 	
 		when you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall
 	
 	
 		no i didn't is that how you're supposed to do
 	
 	
 		or did you start at the edge
 	
 	
 		i started at one edge and went over
 		then you had to cut around the closet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and cut around a window
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i've had my best luck in papering when i start in the middle of a wall and i'll start with a plumb line
 	
 	
 		and start right there
 	
 	
 		and start in the middle of the wall and and go from there
 		and go all the way around the room
 	
 	
 		it seem to get it straighter is that the advantage or what's the
 	
 	
 		well you you
