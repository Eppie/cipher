 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay well you you start it
 	
 	
 		well i feel that women have in the roles that they've played they've uh they used to be at home all the time with the children and now most of them work out of the home because it takes two incomes to make it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		these days and um they just uh they there's more women than men now and they've learned that they have to take care of themselves that they can't depend on a man to support them now
 		
  
 	
 	
 		sure unfortunately what that's done is it's put everybody in a terrible position because it used to be that one person could work whether it a man or a woman
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		okay now we're in a situation where uh it or at least it seems that maybe it's the economy or maybe it's just uh you know employers taking advantage of the fact that women want to work
 		and now that they've made it or at least seems that like two people have to work in order to uh
 		in order to afford to live you know but uh i think it's it's great i mean my wife works uh
 	
 	
 		makes end meet uh-huh
 		well it's really too bad they and because the women are so underpaid and there're so many sole supporters that are women now
 	
 	
 		yeah it's true it's true what they say like women get sixty seven cents to the dollar
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that men make doing the same job that's that's terrible
 		but i i think that'll change too
 	
 	
 		well see in my days when i was a teenager my i wanted to go to school my mother said well she didn't want to send me to school i was going to get married anyway she said
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that meant that i was going to get married and a man was going to work and take care of me but you don't think that way now
 	
 	
 		no that's why now every every woman i know works uh even my mother who didn't work for a while is back working now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		except with the few exceptions of people that are unemployed which is unfortunate lately um every woman i know works my wife took some time off after we had our uh child our first child
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but even that she's planned on getting work which good for her is she works in a  profession that she could get work at home
 		so she's going to
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good that's really good
 	
 	
 		so we don't have to do the
 		yeah she's an editor so she gets to do that and my sister
 	
 	
 		she's a what
 	
 	
 		an editor
 	
 	
 		oh an editor
 	
 	
 		like in publishing yeah
 	
 	
 		oh that's really good she can do that at home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		she could do that at home so that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah i wish they could come up with more jobs for women to stay home with their younger children
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's the dilemma unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately my wife is in a profession that is uh relatively high amount of women in in publishing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and it just so happens or maybe doesn't so happen that it's not a very high paying field
 		now maybe that's because there's a lot of women in it like you're saying women are underpaid uh the amount of money that she was making didn't didn't make it worth her while to uh you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well
 		pay a babysitter and
 	
 	
 		not be home pay for a babysitter or day care
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know say that and and on top of the fact that
 	
 	
 		um-hum plus the clothing she has to have to wear
 	
 	
 		sure sure that on top of the fact that that uh
 		uh she can do some work at home that that it makes it makes it a perfect fit but
 	
 	
 		well that may be a thing for the future the computers now that they're trying to stress that for women to
 	
 	
 		yeah or to have
 	
 	
 		so women can stay home and work on computers
 	
 	
 		or or have day care at the work place one or the other
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but unfortunate it's like that's not doing too well i know a lot of lot of lot of times it's the opposite though a lot of times
 		um
 		men stay home and the women women go to work
 		which i think is good if you're not breast feeding
 	
 	
 		that's not i haven't found anybody like that i've heard of that but i haven't met anyone like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		no i i i've known a few people and i've read uh about others you know just like articles and stuff about other people doing it i certainly would do it uh i have no problem with that unfortunately i'm paid a lot more than my wife so it wouldn't be worth it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um for our family but i
 	
 	
 		well how do you think women's roles are going to change in the future
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i think as as time as time goes on women will um
 		definitely have a better better better role in the work place i think that you know the first wave of women in the work place in any substantial degree was in you know like in the seventies and eighties
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think as women take on um roles of uh more importance in in jobs and and also again not to sounds
 		i don't want to sound like
 		you know like i like i think it's hard but i mean a lot of times women were given jobs because they were women you know and i think once once it evens out so that women get the jobs that they deserve and get the pay that they deserve which will often be
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		powerful positions where there will be less discrimination in hiring when they hopefully when they hire
 	
 	
 		well see i
 		in the past i could understand why men got paid more than women because they were the they called them the bread winners and they'd support the whole family
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah but that's
 	
 	
 		but that's not the case now
 	
 	
 		that's why not the case
 	
 	
 		so i that's why i don't think that they should get paid more than the woman if they're
 	
 	
 		sudden
 	
 	
 		doing the same job
 	
 	
 		why would it be fair earlier i mean you know
