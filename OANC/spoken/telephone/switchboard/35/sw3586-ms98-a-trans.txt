 
     		
 	
 		i'm sorry um hobbies let me see i don't know if that took or not i'll do it again
 	
 	
 		that's okay i didn't hear okay
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay what are your hobbies i hear you have kids right  that's your full time uh hobby right
 	
 	
 		you you heard her in the background  that's babies takes a lot of time huh i like uh most sports i like to do that i kind of like to do a little bit of sewing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh little bit of embroidery work once in a while what do you like to do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um i try to do some painting although i'm not very good at it um
 	
 	
 		well i'm sure you probably are
 	
 	
 		i well no not really
 	
 	
 		you like it that's the main point right
 	
 	
 		yeah i i have you know i inherited the genes that make me think i'm creative but not the ones that give me the ability to be so i always try
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i do some sewing mostly out of necessity um i'm making drapes for my house just because i'm
 	
 	
 		oh boy that's hard sewing
 	
 	
 		yeah well it isn't and it is it is you know actually the sewing isn't the hard part it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room
 	
 	
 		measure it and get it uh
 		well if it it depends on how elaborate you get it if you get pleats and all kinds of things
 	
 	
 		yeah i've been doing that and that yeah that but usually i have to do the pleats by hand so that at least i can do it you know watching TV or whatever but
 	
 	
 		that's a lot of work
 		oh
 		right right
 	
 	
 		yeah and i've i've gone and you know put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through but
 	
 	
 		that feels really good
 	
 	
 		yeah so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything but i i need to do it
 	
 	
 		you do it right
 	
 	
 		i have let's see i have a dog and a lot of fish keeping fish i guess is my biggest hobby and
 	
 	
 		keeping fish
 		well they're probably easier than keeping dogs though aren't they
 	
 	
 		um yes and no it depends on and how frequently they die and how much that bothers you
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		how much that bothers you and you probably have to clean out the tank uh
 	
 	
 		that's you don't do as much as as i thought in fact my problem i had fish as a kid and they always died
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		i mean immediately and what i'm what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding because they need to have a little bit of the
 	
 	
 		because you have right you need to let the bacteria build up and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance
 	
 	
 		i say
 	
 	
 		and i would just take everything out and just like you know wash it with scalding hot water and and it would kill all the bacteria and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again so
 	
 	
 		oh no
 		and so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right so now all i i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing and i don't try and sterilize things
 	
 	
 		right right
 		don't go through the whole nine yards and
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		they kind of need a little bit of that
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so you've had fish for a long time
 	
 	
 		well i've had them i guess it's been two years now i've had a a tank here and and then back at home i used to have a small you know five gallon tank but that never worked well and
 	
 	
 		what size do you have there
 	
 	
 		i have fifty five gallons now it's a lot easier
 	
 	
 		oh that's good size
 		have you ever had it to crack or break or leak  i was just playing you fifty five gallons you'd hope it would never do that
 	
 	
 		no  no not yet
 		that's right i really do but you know
 	
 	
 		what do you have all kinds of different fish or
 	
 	
 		yeah i just have you know what they call community fish you know guppies and platies and and basic things i don't get into the expensive right right the expensive ones
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		real exotic huh well they're probably hardy to harder to take care of and
 	
 	
 		they are and they're very expensive and you know when you die it's like it when when they die it's more like an investment you've lost an investment so
 	
 	
 		yes i bet it is  do you have problems with them uh your fish eating each other
 	
 	
 		no not really only if there's baby fish you always have to isolate those
 	
 	
 		right
 		then you have to how do you isolate them
 	
 	
 		you get um
 	
 	
 		a jars something or
 	
 	
 		well no they have uh breeders it's a little plastic thing that sort of floats
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and you put the mother fish in there and then it's got like a trough underneath her so as the babies come out they fall down the trough and there's a hole in the middle so they fall onto the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that's you know it it kind of works but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate and on occasion if you get a real small one it'll fit out the slots
 	
 	
 		right
 		they will go through the slot
 	
 	
 		that's right so but you know it works i guess
 	
 	
 		that works all right they they don't uh want want the mothers to be with the little fishies
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh they'll eat them yeah
 	
 	
 		they will isn't that odd you wouldn't think that that
 	
 	
 		yes it and it's funny because the one i have every single month without fail she has babies
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		and oh no all all the time and um i've and she's supposed to her variety it says they won't eat the babies and i've seen her do it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that just makes you sick almost doesn't it
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh it's terrible well i mean it makes you understand that you know things are different you know we might right we might decide what's proper and what isn't but you know that's the way it is for them
 	
 	
 		yeah things are different in the animal kingdom huh
 		yeah
 		that's kind of the way they do it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's it
 	
 	
 		survival of the fittest or something
 	
 	
 		yeah because if the baby's strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide
 	
 	
 		right
 		go hide from them well and then you think well how do they do it out in the real world anyway
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		when these little fish are
 		in the tropicals or wherever they are
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of trying to keep up with that but if you're like me you never have enough time for the hobbies
 	
 	
 		huh
 		no not really i i try i also i also i play a couple of instruments
