 
     		
 	
 		hello Jim
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh in Austin Texas
 	
 	
 		oh one of my favorite towns i'm i'm in Houston
 	
 	
 		
  
 		in Houston uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we probably been having relatively similar weather
 	
 	
 		yeah probably although i would imagine that i've had uh  uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh although recently it's been fairly fairly humid uh
 	
 	
 		some warmer weather and and more humidity than  i think that's typically a little drier out there
 		has it really
 	
 	
 		yeah we
 	
 	
 		yeah Austin is a uh actually i have my uh my brother and sister-in-law live in Austin and it is one of my favorite locations it's just i i think it's beautiful
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah it's nice today i i
 	
 	
 		how long have you lived there
 	
 	
 		uh i guess about a little less than five years now
 	
 	
 		yeah practically a native
 	
 	
 		we have lots of non native Texans
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh how hot does it get there in the summer time
 	
 	
 		oh it it varies i mean occasionally it it it gets up over a hundred but it's not uh
 		that's not really well i don't know i was going to say it wasn't not typical but i guess there is
 		quite a phase this quite a period this summer that is was a hundred it stayed over a hundred uh it mid to high nineties it's it's fairly typical uh Houston doesn't get quite as hot actually because the humidity
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah that's correct i mean being i think being a little closer to the uh  to the gulf we it has a moderating factor but again what we what we lack in the heat we make up for in the humidity i lived in Dallas for six years
 	
 	
 		and the ocean
 		the gulf yeah
 		um-hum
 		the humidity
 		
 
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		before uh i was transfered  down to Houston in uh nineteen ninety
 		and uh  Dallas got hotter i mean temperature wise but i  you know Houston can get just as uncomfortable
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah well i
 	
 	
 		but
 		for some reason and and i guess it's uh
 		not having just the extreme heat i mean we had uh one one year we had in in Dallas uh a week or more where it never got
 		below of that eighty two or eighty three degrees at night and then over a hundred every day and that got to be awfully oppressive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i i'm originally from Kansas and and uh south west Kansas which is extremely dry and it's the opposite but but i mean that real serene heat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and and and very cold in the winter uh but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the last summer that i lived there i guess it was the last summer yeah i believe so the last summer that i lived there
 		it we had a streak of something like thirty eight days in a row over a hundred degrees
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh it just absolutely sounds absurd and one day it it it actually hit one hundred and fifteen degrees in the shade
 	
 	
 		you know you know it makes you wonder how anyone ever lived before air conditioning
 	
 	
 		oh i know i know
 		well well that's uh
 	
 	
 		uh how much snow did you get in Kansas
 	
 	
 		oh well well that same year that's when that's when i finally left is that  that same year we had this incredible cold spell and and i uh i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh i mean it was like uh you know thirty degrees below zero
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		yeah and and and i you know i had just bought a little MGB that i was going to fix up and you know sand it down and get it all fixed up and i and i had never bothered to check the antifreeze in it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and uh you know here is this freezing day and i got my heaters up full blast trying to stay warm and
 		and the uh uh and all of the sudden it dawns me i mean it's like  one O clock in the morning
 		oh i wonder if the car's got any antifreeze in it  and of course it didn't uh
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		you know and so so i you know i tried to jump start it i couldn't get it in it still i mean had some it was slushing and uh i tried to start it i tried to jump start it i couldn't it didn't have a jumper cable ran to the store and by the time i got back it had frozen out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		ran back to the store got a can of sterno and you know was doing all kinds of stuff put blankets on the top of it i babied it all night it was fun
 	
 	
 		did you did you uh keep it going
 	
 	
 		it actually i mean the box froze but it didn't it didn't crack anything and i uh i left it for a couple of days and we  called the tow truck and we hauled it over to a friend's garage put heaters on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		warmed it up and i didn't keep it much longer after that but  but it it did uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and after that i decided i was going to go live some place where it was warm
 	
 	
 		well i have never lived anywhere uh  well the farthest north i've ever lived is Raleigh North Carolina which is certainly you know not your ice and snow country
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh and it got you know reasonably cold up there in the in the winter time but i have never lived anywhere where i really had to battle snow and uh i don't think i want to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's kind you know i i finally decided that snow is kind of a neat thing to visit
 		uh you know when you when you felt some ice cold all white white Christmas and some things like that it's a nice thing to go visit but it's not something that i want to live in day in and day out
 	
 	
 		yeah i had some i had some friends who lived in uh  New Hampshire
 		for a couple of years and then they moved back south because they said you know it just  prospect of every morning having to get out shovel the driveway to get out and then shovel the driveway to get back in the morning and shovel it again the next morning they said it just got to be too much
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		well you actually get kind of get used to it after a while i mean and and and in the cold really it doesn't get at you that much because you you of course you learn how to dress well and the houses are well insulated and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i actually i i moved from there to New Orleans and and
