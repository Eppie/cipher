 		okay Lucille i'm Ron Ron Moore
 	
 	
 		all right and what did
 	
 	
 		and our topic okay our topic was did you hear our topic all right basketball i guess i'm probably a lot like you i'm a Dallas Maverick fan
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 		well i certainly am too now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year
 	
 	
 		well unfortunately unfortunately i don't expect a great deal out of them they just have too many problems too many ailments too many hurt bones and maybe too much age at this point
 		you know when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them it just hurt them so bad i feel like everyone else i feel sorry for Donald Carter and the owners of the team and the management of team and everyone else it just seems like
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a a final a final team playing for for all of it national championship or the world championship and something like this happens
 	
 	
 		yes yes sir
 		ah well do you think it's time that we go for new uh coaches is that part of our problem
 	
 	
 		yeah i think at this time we're just in a a rebuilding type of phase you know i think
 		that probably would be evident with the more and more the more and more young guys they draft
 	
 	
 		well it just it's it's it's so discouraging that they can't really i mean they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far
 		i i'm awfully sorry that the Mavericks can't come on and and do Roy who's your next best team or who do you like after the Mavericks
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i'm so much of a Magerick Maverick fan i don't know probably the Boston Celtics i've just always liked the Boston Celtics they have a
 		they have a similar situation now that a lot of uh old guys on the team and but they're still playing good ball but i'm a i've always been a Boston Celtic fan too but
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		you know i've lived in Texas since seventy four so being a transplanted Texan in in the Dallas area i have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks
 	
 	
 		we certainly need to support them do we not do you go to the game
 	
 	
 		yes we do you know
 		yes i go to a few games i haven't been to many i'm not a season ticket holder or anything i was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years and
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school college and doing their own thing sort of gets boring going by yourself
 	
 	
 		yes it does i'm sure it would it's such a monstrous place down there but um maybe next maybe they can do some i don't know who do they need to trade
 	
 	
 		oh you bet
 		well i don't know it seems like  Rolando Blackman and and Harper sort of carry the team they just
 		i don't know if i'm afraid to say that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good but and that can really help the team but they do that they trade the nucleus of their power right now
 	
 	
 		yes sir it seems that way to me i course i don't know any of the newer ones that they have and i'm not well of versed on their capabilities but we really need to do something
 	
 	
 		well you know i feel like uh the best they can hope for this year is probably ah an opportunity to make the play-offs i like their coach i really like Richie a lot
 		and i just i think he deserves a good break he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club and i think Donald Carter the owner i think with all he's invested he deserves a
 		a healthy team for one year and a good break also this thing with Roy Tarpley it just upset everyone i think fans owners management everyone
 	
 	
 		i really
 		yes sir
 		and they have just done as much as they can for that man and he apparently can't straighten his act out so we need to to build on something more positive than that
 	
 	
 		you bet i think they're fools if they ever bring him back
 	
 	
 		oh i do too i certainly would agree to that
 	
 	
 		hate to put it that way i just would not believe him anymore
 	
 	
 		well it um i mean you can't give  anyone too many chances  and i think he has gone over the limit
 	
 	
 		no
 		there's an old saying you can lead you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink so and i think Tarpley's just a sad case but to be making ah a million dollars a year that's pretty sad
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well
 		it is tragic i don't um i mean we're gonna have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes i think
 	
 	
 		oh i think you're right everything just been put out of perspective now you know you take a a young kid Roy Tarpley's age i'd say he was twenty one when he came into the league and and now he's probably an old age of uh twenty five or six
 	
 	
 		uh it
 		yes sir
 	
 	
 		and making all that money well that's uh that's quite a that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they they need at that point in their life i think
 	
 	
 		i think you're right i believe that one so
 	
 	
 		so
 		so i think you know it's created by
