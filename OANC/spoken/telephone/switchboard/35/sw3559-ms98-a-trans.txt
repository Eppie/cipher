 
     		
 	
 		where do you like to go to eat out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well my favorite place to go is a a little Chinese place called um
 		China Night  and i guess that the reason i like to go there is because i like the the kind of food they serve and we've been going there for many years it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's an older spot it's not a real fancy type
 		you know establishment but it is it is enjoyable and and kind of cozy and it's it's quite small
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that's that's where we like to go and how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well my wife and i go to this place in Denton Texas called Rocco's it's a Italian restaurant
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh well i guess first time i went there is about eight years ago i'd i'd just moved back from Florida and went over there you know with my parents
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh when my wife and i got married we had our our wedding dinner there
 	
 	
 		oh how fun
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		one of the things i like most about Rocco's is the people there are real people you know they're not all you know hoity-toity and all that good stuff
 	
 	
 		oh um-hum
 		uh-huh oh so there's good service good people and good food huh
 	
 	
 		sure
 		excellent service uh the food is is always hot and there's always enough
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah that's
 	
 	
 		you know  i hate when i go to a restaurant and i spend twelve bucks for a meal
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you know i got to spend another twelve bucks to find the appetizers
 	
 	
 		Tiffany yeah right and and then when you go home you're still hungry  well that's huh that's interesting you know i've never been to an Italian restaurant and i know  my sister in law was saying the other day she knew of a place little place down in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well it's about thirty miles from here that was a very good Italian restaurant she said and
 		and uh we were discussing going there so i that sounds good how about fast food do you eat fast food much
 	
 	
 		yeah i got cans in my cupboard
 	
 	
 		i mean in a restaurant

 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah we're out in the country
 	
 	
 		oh yes you are
 	
 	
 		and uh fast food for me is fuel you know it's like i buy the cheapest stuff i can find that'll hold me over till i can get home
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right right
 	
 	
 		usually i don't
 		go to fast food places because if i leave the house i generally pack my own lunch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		i i cannot stand cardboard food
 	
 	
 		right  right i agree
