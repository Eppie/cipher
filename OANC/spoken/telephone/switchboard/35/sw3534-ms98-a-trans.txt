 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay go ahead what are you gonna fix for Christmas dinner
 	
 	
 		you know i  i think the simpler the better
 	
 	
 		i think so too yes
 	
 	
 		too often we spend all day
 		cooking and uh it's like Erma  Bombeck's cartoon said it
 		
 
 		you spend eighteen hours fixing your dinner and it takes twelve minutes to eat it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		less than twelve minutes
 	
 	
 		well we're gonna fix a turkey and a ham we're gonna have about fifteen people for dinner and we're gonna have all the fixings with that the dressing and also you know everything with the ham so
 		we're gonna have a real nice dinner
 	
 	
 		well the i think that sounds like fun
 	
 	
 		the thing that i think that's missing at the uh  little Christmas parties though is uh
 		fruits you fix you put out grapes people eat those up first and
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you put out strawberries they grab for those first
 	
 	
 		right and we kind of get uh overdosed on the sweets don't we
 	
 	
 		i think it
 		right i think that's what the problem may maybe that's i think that way because i can't have those sweets  so
 	
 	
 		well they usually don't do a whole lot good for us and uh
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i'm been trying to think of something uh nifty to make for neighbors
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		for neighbors i used to just bake cakes and there's there you go more sweet stuff
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh right
 		i thought people kind of get so overloaded and most people are trying to lose weight anyway
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so it's kind of hard to get away from that isn't it
 		hard to kind of deviate a little bit uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so have you got any good recipes that don't have uh
 	
 	
 		well i i do but they're at home i don't have i'm at work right now and i don't have them with me
 	
 	
 		yes that's true that's right
 	
 	
 		i have some sugarless recipes
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		are you diabetic or
 	
 	
 		no i'm hypoglycemic
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so i have um recipes to make cookies without sugar we put uh fresh
 		applesauce you know fresh fruit in it applesauce and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		raisins and things like that in it
 	
 	
 		no you probably  that's the kind of direction you wanna go with food anyway
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh nowadays food it's uh almost everybody eats out of these boxes don't they  the TV dinners or the
 	
 	
 		they what
 	
 	
 		i think food it's really changing to  not spending so much time everybody's such in a hurry
 	
 	
 		uh you
 		yeah they don't wanna spend time cooking and baking and
 	
 	
 		well and i don't think they have the time as much maybe
 	
 	
 		well when you buy those prepared foods in a store like that they're all they either have too much salt in it in them or too much sugar in them
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		i'm uh i just haven't you know acquired a taste for them have you
 	
 	
 		no because they're too salty most of those
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		dinners like that
 	
 	
 		most of them are
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in fact turkey uh would be my choice of meal anytime i
 		i'm a turkey lover and
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		i could eat turkey
 	
 	
 		mine too
 	
 	
 		unfortunately it's not the easiest uh or it takes a while to prepare it
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but uh it's not necessarily hard it just you got to plan on five or six hours to cook the thing so
 	
 	
 		well that's why people usually have them on holidays because you're usually home visiting and
 	
 	
 		you're home and you've got the time to cook them
 	
 	
 		and it doesn't it smell good in the oven out as it's cooking
 		i said doesn't it smell good
 	
 	
 		yeah in the it just sets the
 	
 	
 		baking in the oven
 	
 	
 		the mood i don't know what uh Thanksgiving or Christmas would be without
 		especially Thanksgiving without the turkey
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		wouldn't quite taste right would it
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		it wouldn't be Thanksgiving dinner without the turkey
 	
 	
 		well even going out to eat we had discussed going out to eat
 		and uh
 		i don't even care at your best restaurant it's just not
 		the same on a holiday to
 	
 	
 		yeah when i go out to eat on Thanksgiving i still have a turkey dinner
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		you'd still have to choose that wouldn't you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i've gone out  on Thanksgiving like that and had other foods and then i'd leave and i'd say well that doesn't it doesn't seem like it's Thanksgiving to me
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		it seems like another day it's because you didn't we didn't have any turkey
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you right right
 		you kind of get used to that um well i think i hope that the trend is to change to more health conscious foods and not have so many  additives and uh preservatives and
 		you know you it's hard to even to get a cold cereal that you don't feel like it's sugar
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right well
 		and uh the women just don't have time to cook anymore like they used to because most of them work
 	
 	
 		no well
 		and i don't mind cooking it's just that you know after you think of the hours it takes you if you get very elaborate sometimes it doesn't seem very rewarding to
 		cook that many hours and then you usually have a  a mess
