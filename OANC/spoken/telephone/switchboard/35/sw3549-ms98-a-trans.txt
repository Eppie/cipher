 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what are you guys having for Christmas
 	
 	
 		what are we having  let's see  well i'm not planning the menu
 	
 	
 		oh you're not
 	
 	
 		no we usually go out to either either one of our folks they both live close to but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know it seems like a a big thing for Christmas is usually ham
 	
 	
 		well funny you should mention that
 		i'm a pig farmer  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh you are huh
 	
 	
 		well now it's kind of a hobby more than anything else but we're going to have uh wild boar
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		we uh we killed a boar the other day it was you know mating with the sows
 		and you can't use the piglets you know so
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's about six months of no use so
 		we uh we shot him and cleaned him out and had him you know processed into ham and uh we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig
 		because i've i've got one that's got a a hernia
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and rather than you know pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery we'll just cook him and eat him
 	
 	
 		is that is that hard
 	
 	
 		oh no hey i tell you what preparing a little pig is is a snap
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm telling you it really is it's easier than chicken
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah you just uh you kill him you know you probably most guys just shoot them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in the head they go you know in a second they're gone and then you just dip the carcass in uh boiling water
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		pull it out and there's a we use a little raspy brush pulls the hair off
 		and uh gut it and uh just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and uh some pineapple couple about three pineapples you know sliced them up
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh cover him up with uh wet uh sacks
 		feed sacks is what i usually use and then start a charcoal fire on top of him
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and after about six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there and it's the best eating you ever had
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well does a boar taste just like regular ham
 	
 	
 		it's just like a pig i mean you know uh it has a lot less fat
 	
 	
 		does that
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh this this wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds
 		and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds
 	
 	
 		oh my God
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		well you and we took the skin and the head and the leg and the feet off and that was about you know a hundred
 		hundred pounds of just ham
 	
 	
 		oh well how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas
 	
 	
 		oh well we're you know we're not going to eat the whole thing gee that take a year but uh you know we're gonna drive up to Kansas City see my wife's folks
 	
 	
 		eat it all yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh she she  what's what's what's your mother cooking for Christmas
 		yeah well her mom's doing brisket
 	
 	
 		i don't what is brisket
 	
 	
 		brisket it's a part of the cow that they used to throw away
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's just tough as a boot
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know they used to use it for leather i think
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		no i mean no i'm just kidding
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh it's it's a part of the loin you know the rib cage
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it has a lot of muscles in it and a lot of gristle where it attaches to the ribs
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it's really really a tough piece of meat but it's so tasty you can't stand it
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so you just take it and you marinate it for a couple of days
 		and
 	
 	
 		that softens it up huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and then uh
 		you just put it in the oven takes about four hours to cook one
 		they weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		and uh we're gonna have that
 	
 	
 		well  what else just serve with your pig pig
 	
 	
 		oh well we'll have cranberries and hominy and uh we we are we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so we have olive olives black olives and cucumbers and uh tomatoes we still have tomatoes
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		yeah fresh tomatoes
 	
 	
 		oh we we just got lots of snow
 	
 	
 		well it started to freeze up around here we there there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire and half of that's down i mean it's thirty degrees this morning
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh my goodness i didn't know it got that low at night
 	
 	
 		but
 		oh yeah well it's desert
 		you know where where we are it's it's it's uh the edge of the desert i mean it's part of the Great Plains
 		so in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred a hundred and ten at night it goes down to about sixty
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		yeah we get a fifty degree degree temperature swing in about four hours
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		so everything that lives around here is real tough
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		like the trees
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know we got hundred year old trees that are you know twenty feet tall
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		that's it that's all the bigger they get they you know they're just hard as a rock
