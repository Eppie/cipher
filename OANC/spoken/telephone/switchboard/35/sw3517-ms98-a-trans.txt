 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay i guess we're ready to start well i guess what part of  what part of the country do you live in oh okay well i'm also in Dallas
 	
 	
 		i'm in Dallas Texas what about yourself
 		okay
 	
 	
 		the reason i ask is the last two conversations i've had or have been out of state
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um  have you always lived here in Dallas and
 	
 	
 		no i've lived here for almost five years now
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and i'm a uh before that i was at school in Rochester New York and i'm originally from Boston
 	
 	
 		oh well you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood
 	
 	
 		that's right but i like it
 	
 	
 		you probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow
 	
 	
 		well i missed it at first but now i go back there and i'm a real wimp about the cold  so i like it here it's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's good i
 		i have lived
 		in Texas essentially all my life and around in Texas and and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know i'm not sure i would want to take on those winters i'm getting older and
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		uh not sure that's really something i wanna do
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i live uh over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um tell me where that is um
 	
 	
 		okay uh you
 	
 	
 		i probably do know but i don't know by that name
 	
 	
 		this is pretty well where LBJ and Audelia Skillman cross
 	
 	
 		okay sure
 	
 	
 		we're just north of uh
 		White Rock Lake
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah i know that area that's a nice area
 	
 	
 		well we have some very nice house homes here in this area um
 		my particular i guess they want us to describe the area so um my particular area the homes run anywhere from about sixty five eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's quite a range
 	
 	
 		yes um
 		the homes that were
 		here earlier  were smaller now they've gotten larger and larger as
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		as they've developed the land and of course it's pretty static right now and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well i am um i'm gosh i'm barely in Dallas i'm just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh okay
 	
 	
 		and i guess we have a similar situation i mean we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy eighty thousand and then we've got Bent Tree right across the street
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so i don't i don't even know how high those go but some of those are pretty big
 	
 	
 		yes those are over a million
 	
 	
 		yeah  so it's that's the strange thing about i guess Dallas because back where i'm from you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all
 		they'd all be pretty similar to one another within a a couple miles so
 	
 	
 		well we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas not as bad as Houston
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but  exactly what you're describing is what happens all over
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i've noticed that
 	
 	
 		well now do you live in a a home or a zero lot home or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh we've got a house let's see we moved in about four years ago
 		and it was it had previously been unoccupied but it had existed for three years
 		this is a whole block of homes that uh a builder built all of them and i guess he he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
  
 	
 	
 		type of deal so the whole block was all foreclosed
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so some were vacant for quite a while before they you know they finally sold them because there were so many
 	
 	
 		well your was your house in good shape was it damaged
 	
 	
 		yeah no the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open
 	
 	
 		oh it was oh
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah so we just you know we bargained to get an extra warranty on that
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and um we're really we haven't had any problems and you know we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the Northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything
 		but the prices are much lower here and this was definitely not a fix up special but i'll tell you it takes all my time
 		between we put in our own sprinkler system and i just finished repainting the exterior and you know making drapes and buying furniture it's just a money pit really is
 	
 	
 		yes i
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		am familiar with that i where i live is a house that's seventeen years old when i bought it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we bought it from someone who was in it but before they had it i found out after i had been in the house it had it had sat empty for the better part of a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm not sure what happened but i do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for for about four years
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		i i
 		i found a lot of things which
