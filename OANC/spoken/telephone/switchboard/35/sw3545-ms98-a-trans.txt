 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um tell me about where you live
 	
 	
 		i live in uh Richardson area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just close to uh Richland College do you live in the area too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i live in Houston
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		although i did live in Dallas for uh six years up until uh nineteen ninety and then i i moved to Houston
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh i uh had lived in Houston before and uh from nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty four and uh lived worked downtown
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when i was transferred from Atlanta uh to Houston i i bought a condo in southwest Houston
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		no and i clocked it and it was only nine miles from the office and of course didn't think that would be bad uh but the only time i ever drove it was not during rush hour
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so so after it was a rude awakening to me to find out what i faced every morning and every afternoon in Houston traffic because where i lived in Atlanta was i lived right on Peachtree um a mile and a half from the office
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i wasn't accustomed to commuting and it nearly killed me so whenever i moved back to Houston i said i i declared that i would not live where i had to drive on the freeways so now i live
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		in really inner city and uh but it's only it takes me about ten minutes to get to the office and i love it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well what kind of a a house is it now are you still in a condo
 	
 	
 		well i'm in an apartment
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but uh  it's just i don't know it's uh
 		i mean
 		most most of the people that i work with you know commute in anywhere from
 		thirty to forty five minutes some of them an hour or more one way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know  i mean i've i've had a house before and i mean and it's nice but it's just not worth it to me to sit behind the wheel of a car for that long
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i just i can't do it so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		anyway i'm very i'm i'm pretty content for the time being where i am
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh we um rent a duplex right now and it's only like a couple of miles from where i work it's a little bit further for my husband we used to both work at the same building at TI and it was only like two miles from the uh duplex
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now he's moved but he's going against the flow of the traffic so it's not too bad of a commute it only takes him about fifteen minutes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that isn't that isn't bad really
 	
 	
 		no he can get on the highway and  he's going north whereas most of the people are like in Plano going south
 		so he's you know in a good situation because the traffic is not as heavy in his direction but we've been looking for a house but  the first consideration to us is location you know they keep building
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		further and further out and of course you can get more house for the money and stuff but you know to me i'm the same way that day to day commute i don't like
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh you know it's like i said i i mean i've even had people at the office ask me they say how do you justify paying the kind of money you pay for rent because i do pay a lot of money every month for rent i don't deny it
 		but at the same time i said well you know let's think about it  i said i drive um less than ten miles a day round-trip
 		and they go you know they're jaws dropped and then and then they go and i spend way less than thirty minutes a day
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		round-trip commuting and you know that doesn't that's regardless of the weather if it's raining it still doesn't take me any longer i mean sometimes whenever and you know how Houston is it's just so flat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we have these torrential downpours sometimes and people literally get you know traffic gets backed up with the wrecks and everything and it'll take them an hour and a half to get to work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're just frayed by the time they get there i think no way so
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think too now we both have little bit older cars i mean both our cars are over ten years old now if you get a house if you buy a house more for your money further out you're gonna have to have a pretty decent car and put a lot into uh
 		your car payments and your gas and stuff
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i mean you know if you've got to drive it sixty miles a day you're gonna go through that car a heck of a lot faster than what we did i mean that's not something people think about is the car the car payments and the gas
 	
 	
 		oh i agree with you a hundred percent since i'm um  moved got this place i mean i used to i can remember years ago when i worked especially whenever i lived in Houston before i used to put twenty thousand miles a year on my car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		last year i put less than twelve on my car
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know and you you can really tell a difference i mean i just don't you know it's just not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't have that expense and by the time i cut down the the cost of my insurance because my car insurance is a little bit less by living so close then the additional automobile expense
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's i i thought about it  it's i mean i would like to own again i've owned in the past but i don't know i'm i'm hesitant to give up the convenience
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		plus where i live is so well managed i mean if i have any little thing go wrong i just pick up the phone at the office i call my manager i said we got this problem i come home in the afternoon there's a note on my dining room table saying we've been in we fixed it let us know if there's a problem
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i love it i'll be honest with you hey it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
