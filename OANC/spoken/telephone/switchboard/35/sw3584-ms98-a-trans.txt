 
     		
 	
 		well tell me about your home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay uh right now we're living in uh well it's me uh my wife and uh two young boys
 		and uh right now we're in a uh i guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which you might call it so we don't have a a big yard uh but uh when my wife and i first moved in it was just the two of us so it was enough
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and it's uh i guess what they call a story and a half because it's not a full two story
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where you know everything on top is on bottom
 		so it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it's about a five year old house now
 	
 	
 		it sounds nice
 	
 	
 		it's uh pretty nice unfortunately unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a Landmark is the one who built it
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know these guys that gambled high lost big you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		exactly what happened to them
 	
 	
 		i'm insulating myself from that problem i'm building my own house
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		
  
 		and as i look out the window of my trailer i can envision
 		all the insulation that's going up  today
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really are you doing it yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i used to be a builder
 	
 	
 		wow
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		and i retired about five years ago
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and started college
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and now i'm uh a college educated builder
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's still no work you know
 		so uh you know i decided this summer that uh you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so i did
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		and uh see the the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
 	
 	
 		really is that so i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own
 	
 	
 		that sounds kind of dumb
 	
 	
 		well it's to protect the
 		the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home and then it doesn't sell and then the bank's holding the bag
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		as as you know anything that involves the government is works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much right hence the savings and loan problem we have today
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh you know my home is uh fairly simple it's designed to be added on to
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i figure it's just me and my wife but you know i like to do stuff with my hands and what not so i'm gonna have a shop
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah how big a lot do you got it on
 	
 	
 		ten acres
 	
 	
 		wow that's nice that's real nice
 	
 	
 		well yes it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest neighbor he's on the other side of a hill
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		seriously
 	
 	
 		God that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		and well in summer in the winter time i can see see another guy but you know he's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i can just make out his place you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten mile to the
 		north
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		oh that's pretty good uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well i took a lot of time in choosing this site
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because the the house has no heating or air conditioning
 	
 	
 		oh you you you don't plan on putting any any of that in
 	
 	
 		well it's got a a very small furnace and a uh i'm use a wood burning stove as well but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in the house itself i've been working inside you know these low these many months and i have not had to use the heat
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		wow
 	
 	
 		because it's all geothermal
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		and with all the see i've got on the south side is all glass well as much as i could get in it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the east side is glass i've got uh one two three four five six windows in the east side on forty eight feet so it's almost all glass
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		my wife would love that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i mean you know
 	
 	
 		she loves lots of windows
 	
 	
 		there's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		is it a single story
 	
 	
 		well not really it's uh it's on the side of a hill
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		so the first you know the the the what i call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um i see
 	
 	
 		and the side that's on the uh the other side is about six feet high
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i got a pretty good grade there and then when i put the verandas which which will be twelve feet out all all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's kind of like uh like a Victorian style
 	
 	
 		so
 		exactly yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i've always liked that the you know i we don't have much yard but i built a small deck in the back but you know i i see th ese magazines where you know do your self your own decks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i kind of wish i had them the size property and
 		and uh one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck when
 	
 	
 		yeah
