 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well seems to me the one of the reasons that people don't go out to vote is maybe they're bored with the whole election process
 	
 	
 		well i agree with the boredom of the election process but i also uh think that people don't realize that their boat vote will make a difference uh they feel like that
 		you know it's going to go however it's going to go and their one little vote's not going to make that much difference and it's just why make the effort
 	
 	
 		well sometimes strangely enough one vote has made the difference
 	
 	
 		well i agree with that and i and i do know that you you know all those votes are counted and and they do make a difference
 		um also i think that
 		people have a tendency to to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the
 		the more local elections
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of strange because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day-to-day lives
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		exactly and uh i i even have a tendency to do that myself and i have to really make a concerted effort to to get involved i lived i live in a suburb in Mesquite
 		and uh so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what's going to because that directly affects me but i i think on the whole most people don't
 		uh feel that way or don't even look even look at that i think they just don't even
 		i i don't think they're conscious of it
 	
 	
 		well main part of the problem is they don't they think they have enough choices
 	
 	
 		well that may be true too i hadn't thought of that
 	
 	
 		you know in some of the European countries they have numbers of parties that run and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		and sometimes it's uh
 		well not sometimes but many times it's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign and
 		and issues get uh bogged down
 	
 	
 		well maybe it's a matter of you know voter awareness
 	
 	
 		um i think voter awareness i worked i did some work for the uh Women's League of uh
 		Voters uh several years ago
 		and i think there are some organizations that used to uh do some voter awareness uh things don't they don't get a lot of participation they don't get a lot of uh
 		activity most of the League of Women Voters
 		what they did was they put out information
 		so that it it would just be made available to everyone now other areas that i've worked in like in the chambers they would just have the candidates come and it would just you know that was not a lot lot of community involvement and those were people that would mostly vote anyway
 	
 	
 		well i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long in Britain you know they have a set period of time and and for campaign that's it in this country it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign
 	
 	
 		it's a it's an ongoing campaign and it's expensive campaign and it it uh eliminates a lot of qualified people
 		uh maybe more qualified and uh more dedicated
 		uh
 		uh to the issues
 	
 	
 		well the they don't want to spend the time or they don't have the money
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		exactly and it it
 		i i can't believe i just can't believe i've i've worked in a couple of local campaigns
 		i just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally
 	
 	
 		well it's a matter of name recognition people aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of
 	
 	
 		oh well i agree with that
 		but also and i and i'm not for
 		controlling controlling how much is spent but do you know
 		that's one thing if a if the time wasn't so
 		if it wasn't such a long uh campaigning time
 		then
 		they couldn't spend as much money
 	
 	
 		and even debates don't seem to help much
 	
 	
 		no they really don't
 		uh it's always it's a lot of it is who looks the best
 		who uh
 		who happens to say the right thing at the right time who not not it who may not be
 		the most qualified and can get the  uh the job done
 	
 	
 		so we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		and it's a it's a lot i've worked in public relations a lot and
 		uh
 		that kind of thing can make and break make or break you as you can
 		remember  uh Clayton Williams'
 		campaign
 	
 	
 		well that was certainly a media event
 	
 	
 		it really was and it's just uh
 		uh he possibly could have uh won that election had it not been for some of the
 		the uh the way he presented himself
 	
 	
 		well he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hoof is is i guess the right term for him
