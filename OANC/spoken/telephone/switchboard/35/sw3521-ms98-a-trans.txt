 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so are are you a news person
 	
 	
 		uh i really am i enjoy i enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as i can although you know i'm a full-time student and i work full-time too so or not full-time but i work quite a bit and so  so i mostly depend on the radio
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know on the way to work i like i like to listen to National Public Radio uh All Things Considered
 	
 	
 		yes great show
 	
 	
 		yeah and i like to listen to that and catch you know you i don't get i don't get a lot of uh sometimes i don't get the current events you know because that show kind of has feature stories that might not  directly deal with uh
 		you know some important issue on the day but
 	
 	
 		yeah so so the real the real current news and the hard news
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is is not a there's not really enough of it there
 	
 	
 		right that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i've had i've had that frustration too and i end up switching stations from time to time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah do you like you like NPR's uh programming
 	
 	
 		uh in general you know um i watch
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a lot of CNN uh and C-SPAN
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i i  subscribe to three newspapers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know i sort of can't get enough of this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and i when i travel elsewhere i'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have
 	
 	
 		how how how oh yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		of of world world events and national events
 		well in in Dallas what are the what is the newspaper situation
 	
 	
 		well  we don't we we have a a big newspaper situation uh
 		because we used to have two newspapers up until uh last Sunday and a uh major um a one of our major papers just closed down they closed shop and said well we can't put any more papers out and we're done
 	
 	
 		hm
 		was was that the the better paper or  compared to the the other
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought so it was a it was a more effective paper as far as i was concerned it it had uh  uh it got to the news you know and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh which i like i don't i don't like to you know i like to save the editorial information or the  the politically uh weighted information you know for the for a different section i like just to get to the you know find out what's happening
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		pretty quick uh and i feel that the other newspaper uh uh the Times the Dallas Morning News is the one that's still here the Times Herald is the one that closed up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh the the Morning News was was is is okay but you know you have to wade through a lot of editorial
 		garbage as far as i'm concerned you know  many times it doesn't  doesn't reflect my own opinion and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		but if you if you were to look at the front page of today's Morning News Morning Times rather uh would would you would you see  things about what's going on in Europe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no no that's the problem uh you you know you see you see Troy Aikman's knee surgery on the front page you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		whoever Troy Aikman is
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah a a quarterback for the Broncos or for the for the Cowboys uh you know you know you know what i mean that there's uh  local news that
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh that really a lot of times doesn't doesn't change
 		change my life one way or the other  so uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess it's current events but not the kind of current events that changes the world
 	
 	
 		right right yeah not something you'll you'll uh be interested in ten years from now by any means
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know how how about you uh i guess in Washington D C you guys have several papers that are pretty
 	
 	
 		yes um i i rather like the Washington Post
 	
 	
 		pretty effective don't you
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i also get the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and you know each of them covers different things in in different different different in different ways and so it's
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh you know if i only looked at one of them i would have a different perspective clearly would have a different perspective on the world
 	
 	
 		right yeah uh i i i have a question uh does does does the Wall Street Journal uh i i've kind of gathered lately that uh maybe their information is not just only related to business is that is that a correct assumption
 	
 	
 		that that that is certainly true um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they will they will have articles like a few days ago they had a a nice article on Einstein you know theory of relativity
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		you know that started on the front page and ran ran in into the full almost full page inside
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now these are feature kind of articles all all the all the um
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		you know the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but but there's some very good other articles
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you'll find in the in the Journal
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you find that you're uh  uh disappointed or pleased with uh uh the performance of like network coverage of news
 	
 	
 		um  i wish it were in more depth um that doesn't mean to say longer just more facts would be nice
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		CNN has has you know was was pretty good during the war
 	
 	
 		oh yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		um
 		and they were you know sort of had a unique vantage point for for doing that reporting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you know it's not it's it's uh never quite
