 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so how do you feel about capital punishment
 	
 	
 		well i i'm not really certain how i uh i i'm not certain that it does does a lot of good i mean that it ends up ends up effectively uh uh
 		uh avoiding a lot of the crimes that that have capital punishment
 	
 	
 		right you don't think
 	
 	
 		penalties yet on the other hand uh i don't know i mean there's things that seems like it's it's it's the right thing to do now
 		you know i mean somebody as serial serial serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns you know fifty fifty children in a school yard you kind of
 		i don't know
 		what about yourself
 	
 	
 		i uh um i have a the same dilemma i think um it's it's you know it seems right sometimes and then other times you don't know um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i mean people like i  it's been shown i mean like the Arab societies and stuff end up uh having  effective effective
 		effective punishments and and they're they're extremely severe
 		um i you know i think to a certain degree the reason that it it doesn't serve as a deterrent uh may be because
 		you you you you never know if it's gonna be applied applied
 		right unlike unlike uh like in in Arab societies if you got get caught stealing they chop off your hand and and you walk around the rest of your life  with one hand and then everybody knows exactly what what for right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know and here with our court system and and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can
 		you can kind of
 		always count on the fact you know or or there's a good chance you're gonna get off and so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and also it doesn't seem like it does them any harm i mean sure their life is taken but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway so i think sometimes they'd prefer just to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		get it over with so it's more of the easy way out than
 	
 	
 		yeah some people
 	
 	
 		making them pay for the consequences for the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know what they've done
 	
 	
 		except that you know i mean the the average cost  to  society
 		to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is is extremely high i mean something i i was amazed at a uh per year it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to keep people in jail uh you know i mean that's sort of a uh sort of a crass perspective i mean on the usage of capital punishment but on the other hand uh um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i don't i don't know if if it's a crime that's that's that serious that they're really never gonna be out of jail um
 	
 	
 		right but then again also you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway so
 		um
 		it's
 		it doesn't it seems by that by
 		i don't know doesn't ever really
 		pay um
 	
 	
 		oh i know i mean you can't it doesn't taking taking one more life doesn't doesn't doesn't get replace you know get things back the way they were right yeah i don't know i i don't know i really don't know uh i'm in Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right it doesn't bring back every
 		what state are you in
 		oh really in Dallas
 	
 	
 		where where no i'm in Austin
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and where are you where are you calling from
 	
 	
 		um right now i'm in Utah but i'm from Plano Texas
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		yeah so you
 	
 	
 		um what are the laws like in Texas it's
 	
 	
 		it is Texas is has has is one of the
 		one of the states well i guess there's more and more states that are that are going back to capital punishment um Texas has had it for a while it's one of the quicker it once it was uh it was reallowed i think it was outlawed for a while by the by the supreme court i mean or or the interpretation of the constitution
 		and it seems like everybody stopped and then and then once they sort of reallowed it Texas was one of the first to uh to actually uh implement it again
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		they do it by uh by lethal do it by lethal injection
 		so you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm originally from Kansas and in Kansas also uh they
 		they almost immediately put back capital punishment and uh there they do it by hanging
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		still right they have
 		i still remember the the the movie uh In Cold Blood
 		i don't know if you've ever i i i'm sure you're familiar with it but have you seen the movie
 	
 	
 		i haven't no
 	
 	
 		yeah the way
 	
 	
 		and they do it that way
 	
 	
 		yeah well they they show it  not not i mean the the movie was made in like nineteen sixty two or something like that and so it's uh it's not particularly graphic but on the other hand it's
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's fairly impressive to watch them you know walk into the room with gallows it's a kind of a barn like structure
 	
 	
 		wow
 		yeah i think that they're i think that capital punishment is is is um in tact in Utah also i'm not really familiar with
 	
 	
 		is that right are you there in school yeah uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i am
 		so but i think that they do  well well long time ago i can i remember my dad was telling me this i think that um
 		they do it by like a bunch of men have guns and one of them has the real gun in it so they don't know who killed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		has has a yeah has has a real bullet and the rest of them have blanks
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think
 	
 	
 		yeah i i certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner i know that  i've always said that if i if i had to kill and clean and  my own my own meat i think i'd become a vegetarian
 	
 	
 		yeah i know
 		i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		as as long as you're sort of safely removed from it it seems seems not so not so bad i guess but
