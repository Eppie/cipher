 
     		
 	
 		you go ahead and start or i will whichever you prefer
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay um well i the thing i like to do the most is swim
 		and i was doing that real regularly but i am expecting right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and sick and uh so i have kind of slowed down a little bit
 		but anyway that's the thing that i've found works the best for me is is just doing lap swimming
 	
 	
 		well me i play i love playing basketball and volleyball
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		i do and i play well i played a lot
 		until i hurt my shoulders this summer playing volleyball and
 		they haven't come back to full swing yet so i haven't been able to play as much as i would have liked to but
 	
 	
 		oh did you play in high school
 	
 	
 		no in Texas they don't have um they don't have volleyball i played basketball but not on the school team
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just played a lot recreational i didn't have i worked so so i didn't really have time but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's i love actually athletics is really for me it's a great thing to do i do it one to keep in shape and two just to to not stress it's my release of tension
 	
 	
 		oh well i know my husband likes to do that he plays racquetball too yeah uh-huh he still does some
 	
 	
 		oh does he
 	
 	
 		he's he's played it since i guess he was in college and then um he plays uh two or three times a week so he's a member of the Sports Mall in Salt Lake and he'll go on his noon hour and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he still likes to do that so that i know that that's one thing that he likes to do and i think that relieves stress too
 	
 	
 		that's awesome
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you guys mostly just exercise to release stress or to relax or
 	
 	
 		oh well i think i do it for uh weight reasons i mean you know to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so you don't gain weight but
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and also i i know i feel a lot better when i do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i like i said i have just been really sick and and just can't i'm just almost too tired i i was going um in the mornings
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that
 	
 	
 		well i tell you having a kid is rough isn't it
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		from what i hear having a kid is rough
 	
 	
 		well yeah we we have also have an eleven month old and a six year old and and so it's just kind of
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um it's finding the time for me to exercise is another thing but i really do like to do it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well great
 	
 	
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		you're a brave woman to do all that
 	
 	
 		oh jeez well the the kids kind of keep me exercising too
 	
 	
 		that's true there
 	
 	
 		just chasing after them i guess yeah so you do you have much time to do that since you're in college now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i make time really if i if i don't make time my study habits or actually i don't my studying doesn't go as well i can't concentrate and so
 	
 	
 		and so it just kind of helps to work it in there huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and really it's if i don't if i do it i i feel like i get a lot more accomplished in a day than if i don't
 	
 	
 		huh well
 	
 	
 		and so it's it's for me it just is worthwhile to find time to even if for half an hour just to get out and run
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's probably true with anything when you work some exercise in it just seems like things seem to go more smoothly i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that should be a part of i guess everybody's daily things
 	
 	
 		i tend to agree i think it makes it a lot better for the person as well as as for a couple if you're married or if you're anything like that it just helps to i don't know to have something to do
 	
 	
 		oh i know my husband wants me to take up golf that's another thing he does and uh you know i don't know that i see that as a real big exercise though
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i've i've been a few times but that's something i am really bad  i mean you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it takes me a million strokes to get it in so
 	
 	
 		that's right that's me too and i'm supposed to be good at it so
 	
 	
 		oh  so you do golf huh
 	
 	
 		i do no i try i'll put it that way i'm not very good i i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i enjoy it just because again it gets me out it gets me away from every all the stresses of school and work and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well do you ski
 	
 	
 		i do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's something i really enjoy i
 		especially now that the snow's good this year
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		been a few times and really enjoyed it it's it's amazing how each exercise works on a different part of your body i never realized you know i thought basketball basically covered it all but after i skied a few times i've just been dead
 	
 	
 		have you oh
 		yeah you felt some muscles that you  oh i haven't been skiing for years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh

 		huh-uh uh not downhill we do have cross country skies and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i i enjoy that but i don't know downhill i was always real bad at that too and it's just the thoughts of it kind of scare me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was one of these out of control
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		skiers but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well
