 		uh what kind of hobbies are you into
 	
 	
 		well i'm quilting and uh pressing fact i was pressing a
 		the uh pieces for a quilt block i will stop start stitching on  when the phone rang
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so where uh what are you into woodwork
 	
 	
 		uh no uh tole painting and uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		folk art
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw something uh you've seen these old wooden school desks the old ones
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i saw some uh
 		or one anyway in a shop here
 		oh i don't even remember where i was
 		two or three weeks ago that had been uh
 		painted with that looked like maybe just a flat finish and then tole painting on it and the uh
 		flowers and borders and trims and stuff and it was just real pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we we used to live in Hillsboro and i there's a
 		a lady that i knew that had a uh gift shop and she gave art lessons and i've taken lessons there and got into it and
 		tried a little bit of landscaping so
 		painting is pretty interesting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how long you been quilting quite a while or
 	
 	
 		no not uh not a real long time since about um
 		i guess it was in probably nineteen eighty eight when i got into it
 		and i belong to a quilt guild in in McKinney we just meet once a month but
 		uh we've had a project going this last almost a year now where we uh when i joined the quilt guild there was just
 		i made the
 		i think the thirteenth member and we just wrote down the names of the
 		months and then we all drew for uh
 		a month
 		and everyone in the guild makes a block
 		for the the person who's turn it is that month and we have the uh
 		privilege of selecting a pattern or
 		of colors or providing the material and the pattern
 		or some of them just say
 		uh for instance the December is what they call a Christmas sampler
 		and she gave us one piece of uh fabric to use in it and then we have to come up with something else to go with it
 		and when they're all put together needless to say they've got enough for a block and our guild has grown now to where we have twenty members
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and so uh February is when i get the blocks
 		and my husband has picked the
 		the pattern that he wants and the colors so
 		it'll be it'll be interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah it sounds like it  i've seen some beautiful quilts around i i've got some that my mother made and i still have
 	
 	
 		oh goodness those are those are really
 		family heirlooms and
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got one that uh she made when i was a kid with the you know Raggedy Ann and Andy patterns on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's some of the stitches you know have come loose on it but
 		you know i still keep it though

 		John Godfrey that that TI who's doing this his son's in our scout troop
 		and he contacted us and he he suggested that all the adult members do this and turn the money in
 		that they collected for the phone calls to the troop so we you know pick up a little extra funds that way
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good
 		it really is that's a
 		a good fund raiser

 		involved
