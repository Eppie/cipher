 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh  okay  all right i'll start uh funding
 	
 	
 		well i guess  you could go first perhaps on this one
 	
 	
 		i think that in light of the seriousness of it of the fact that that uh by what uh
 		i think they said by the year two thousand there'll be at least five is it five thousand a year or more
 	
 	
 		is that what it is statistically
 	
 	
 		uh yeah will be dying from it and i know uh what is it uh over in Africa it's just  already in horrendous uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right truly an epidemic
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is so in light of that i think that that we're probably going to have to increase the funding for research i think that uh i don't know if they have it but it looks like to me that all the countries could go together
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and have like a joint AIDS research program i don't know if they already have one of those where everybody could put in their input
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		do you know if that exists today in a cross country kind of collective
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		i don't know i don't i don't hear about research that much except in the terms of what the United States is doing
 		and the celebrities that show you know the benefits and things that they put on for AIDS research i do i did hear about uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Africa and um
 		how rampant it is over there
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and i know uh in talking to i have a relative that works for uh state welfare in Oklahoma the AIDS children that are coming in with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it i mean it it's it's tragic it's just absolutely horrible and it's you know it's not just homosexuals it's you know heterosexuals it's you know the drug users it's
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		innocent people that you know go in for blood transfusions so i mean it's starting to affect everyone
 	
 	
 		do you think that the visibility um is part of what is keeping it in the limelight the fact that the funding sources are being discussed so so regularly um is because um
 		of  the nature of the disease the fact that it's such a terrible way to die and so on
 	
 	
 		i think that probably partly is it i think that it is has received so much more publicity since we have had well-known actors athletes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		everything coming down with it i think that uh i do agree with someone when uh Magic Johnson announced
 		uh there was a uh spokesman spokesperson for the gay community
 		that came out and said that you know it would not be receiving this much publicity if it wasn't for someone like Magic Johnson and it would be you know very interesting to see
 	
 	
 		it's true it's a different level of publicity um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right and i think it it i think it makes people more aware that it hits other than just the gay community and uh
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but i do think that that
 		in light of the fact that it's going to hit all of us i think what are they saying by the year two thousand i think it's one in three is supposed to have it
 		you know it it because it it is it's spreading so rapidly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		i agree with you i do believe that there should be a greater amount of uh funding sources set aside for it but i
 		i know that the visibility of it is part of what's causing it to get this attention now and i would hope that the emphasis would continue over the long term i mean i'm surprised to see
 		the numbers of um people who for example who women who have breast cancer and have died are even greater than the number of people who who have died from AIDS
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't realize that
 	
 	
 		on on a regular basis that the statistics are higher and yet
 		it's such a benign kind of a thing it seems like it's been with us for a long time and it's such a
 	
 	
 		well it is i know that i i heard another conversation regarding AIDS the fact that that you know cancer is not receiving this and yet is is cancer growing at such a rapid rate
 	
 	
 		that may be the other issue that it's it's it's reaching epidemic proportions and we have
 	
 	
 		you know it it
 		you know and i think that's what is scaring people is that it is reaching such epidemic proportions you know where
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		is is cancer on the rising is it rising as rapidly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know as for instance AIDS you know uh it
 	
 	
 		yes and i don't know that it may not be
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't know either you know it's it's just uh
 		and granted i i do think that because of the publicity and because of the people you know getting it and everything
 		i think that that people are more aware of it than you know say if you know someone just dies with cancer which is it's a tragic way
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean you know it's tragic that it's that way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i i look at the community resources that were dedicated to um those with cancer in terms of transitional living environments and um  volunteer services and those sorts of things
