 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right
 	
 	
 		so what was the last car repair that you had done on your car
 	
 	
 		well we have two cars and on our little Honda we had to replace some CV joints and on our bigger car it's a Chevrolet we had to repair
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the control module
 	
 	
 		the control module a mystery box huh
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		yeah yeah right so we've had just recently a couple of things the CV joints my husband just did himself and i'm glad he can do that because that saves us lots
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's that's impressive he's able to do a job like that because that requires special tools
 	
 	
 		lots of money
 		yes he does and he's lucky in that way too because his his dad lives real close and he has a lot of the tools
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		so so he's able to do quite a few things like that and saves quite a bit of money
 	
 	
 		that that's great what
 		what kind of jobs would you folks repair refer refer to a garage
 	
 	
 		um well we had to have the the Chevrolet had to be repair done by a repair man the you know the control module and even though that
 		that still hasn't been taken of in fact we were driving along the other night and the engine light came back on but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the man wouldn't the repair man when he fixed it said that it looks like um the computer panel or or the whatever it was needed to be replaced also and we didn't have it done at the time so it looks like we'll need to go back in and
 		have that done
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well um the last thing that i had to have done to my car uh i wound up doing myself and um that was uh tuning it up
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um i had been having a a problem where i would be driving along and and i would notice this at night when i'd be sitting at a light i would see smoke in my uh
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		my headlights and uh then later on when you know i'd i'd get out wherever i was going i would smell uh something had been burning
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i pretty much figured it was oil because i'd looked under the hood a couple of times and there was a a lot more oil sort of floating around than you should have on a Honda which i ironically have too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you'd expect the car to be really clean inside
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it run real well real well and so anyway i i had been thinking about it for a long time and discovered that um
 		uh or i had decided that what had happened is there's a a a little piece of metal that sits there over the top of the valve train called the valve uh uh cover
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i decided that there must be something wrong with the gasket or perhaps the the whole cover itself hadn't been uh tightened down well or whatever and so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		when i was doing this tune up i decided it was time for me to explore
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and sure enough that's what the problem was
 	
 	
 		my word huh
 	
 	
 		and so i went out and i got a new gasket and slipped it in there
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and on on older cars up to i i in fact i have no idea when they started doing this but but on the older cars they used to make the gasket out of a cork like material and on this car they make it out of a rubber like material
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		oh so do you enjoy doing the repairs yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah up to a certain point i used to do a lot more of it when i was younger than i do now um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i have to admit that when the weather starts to get cold there's just no fun like a busted knuckle i just uh i just can't even tell you the joy i get from that experience and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		right
 		oh well that's what my husband says too he says when you have the right tools and a good place to do it in it's it's enjoyable and he really likes to be able to to do it but when you don't have the right tools
 		you're out in the weather it's no fun at all
 	
 	
 		sure and my finances have always been a little precarious so sometimes repairing the car is a financial necessity
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right right
 	
 	
 		um but it's the the down side of that is that i very rarely always had the right tools and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i've
 	
 	
 		because yeah you can't afford to buy them so
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly yeah yeah it's a sort of a catch twenty two if you're well enough off to buy these exotic tools you need to do the work then you can generally have somebody else do it for you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		uh-huh so have you found um one certain type of car needs less repair work than another
 	
 	
 		so
 		well um
 	
 	
 		have you had that many different cars or
 	
 	
 		it's funny i've i've owned a lot of different cars i started out with Volkswagons and then um
 		uh graduated to um a Honda and had that for a long time and then graduated to a Volvo and then wound up with a Honda again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i've i've  had them all and and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh have gotten to know the engines in each one of these uh sorts of vehicles and but uh i in the Volkswagon business i i went from you know owning a bug to owning uh one of their cars called a Rabbit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		oh yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the and there was a completely different kind of engine in the Rabbit um but i i actually rebuilt a Volkswagon bug engine at one point and uh so i learned an awful lot about cars uh that way and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		boy i'll say i'll say well we i don't know we're a little bit partial our Honda we have got a hundred and
