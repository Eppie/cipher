 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		this is a kind of ironic subject for me because this is the first year um
 		i purchased i mean i i was actually able to uh get some credit cards because i'm twenty one and i got it through school
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		and i i've kind of you know you kind of make a purchase and you and you forget you know what you put on your credit card and you know within a month you know they send you your bill and uh
 		i i'm about three thousand dollars in debt right now
 	
 	
 		oh dear  it can add up in a hurry
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they do i mean it's amazing it's like a an an illness or a sickness or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well it's it's uh it's easy to use there's no doubt about them i've had i've had one for oh probably ten years now
 		and if you can if you pay it off every month generally generally you're okay um our experience has been um we usually pay it off each month but around Christmas time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we sometimes have to slide a month or a month or so to
 	
 	
 		yeah Christmas time i can understand but what my after i got one i didn't just stop i got i've got about five
 	
 	
 		yeah get caught up
 		oh uh-huh they'll send you one about every time you turn around
 	
 	
 		six six credit cards yeah and uh
 		so i just charged a little on each and uh and you just get the um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		the adding machine out and you add it up and it's it's amazing
 	
 	
 		well you see these people that cut there's up say it's time to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		we went to we went on vacation and uh
 		and i charged a lot you know just well i charged um like clothes for the vacation and then on the vacation you know charged your hotel
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then you know when you got to eat you charge the rest i mean you know it's so convenient and
 	
 	
 		oh and there's uh
 	
 	
 		and you just don't i guess you know i'm just really stupid i just didn't realize
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i like them for a couple of aspects one is you don't have to carry a lot of cash with you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the other is you know you got that statement and you can make one payment you don't have to write out a bunch of checks or always be paying for things it's convenient from that standpoint
 		so it's it's nice from that standpoint from that angle but it can get out of hand in the interest rate on them is is quite high generally there are some that are lower you know you can get some that are
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh probably around twelve thirteen percent but most are around sixteen to eighteen or higher
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i have a friend that um she's married and her and her husband uh
 		she said you know they tried really hard to pay them off and it took them three years before they were able to uh pay off their credit cards
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah although you know they keep increasing your limit too you know i had a card that uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i think it started out with like a fifteen hundred dollar limit
 		and i've had it for several years and i think i'm now up to uh seven thousand five hundred on it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean i'm not course i don't always spend that much but that's what they'd let me spend if i wanted to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess they they get to trusting you a little bit and
 		i want to hold that bait out i don't know if the card companies that you have usually around Christmas time they'll they'll send you a little group of checks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		say instead of using your credit card if you want to just go ahead and write these checks and we'll charge it'll go right against your account they they try to induce you during the Christmas season to to wrack up a few more dollars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i think they're good but you've got to be careful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that'd be my overall summary
 	
 	
 		i think it was hard for me because i wasn't working at the time and i was just going to school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it was like every weekend i would just
 		it's it was like sickness to me and i just got and just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		spend uh but
 	
 	
 		well  i don't know  everybody likes them at least for a couple of things they're they're handy they're nice on when you travel
 	
 	
 		just yeah
 	
 	
 		well what kind do you have
 	
 	
 		um i have a Discover
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a Visa
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a Sears and i have like most of the department stores
 	
 	
 		yeah well the Discover one is supposed to pay you back a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have you experienced that or not
 	
 	
 		i have um i have maxed that one
 	
 	
 		what have you well that's uh i think that one's sponsored by Sears if i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it is and i got the Sears through the Discover before i had um
 		and i didn't even know i went over my limit i mean that's i just didn't even add it up i don't know i'm just
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i was just going crazy
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		and there's about fourteen hundred dollars on that card
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well it can it doesn't take long
 		i i just ordered a video camera yesterday and that's why that always bothers me a little bit to give your credit card number over the telephone but i
 	
 	
 		um-hum i wouldn't do that i would not do that i've seen on TV and and there's too many scams
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and there there can be there's no doubt about it we've
