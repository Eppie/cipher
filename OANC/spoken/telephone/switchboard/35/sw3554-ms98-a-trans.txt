 
     		
 	
 		of the exercise program you have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well um  i have a a a former exercise program i'm a graduate student and this semester i'll tell you what i it's been almost impossible for me to get you know back to regular exercise
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um  last summer i was a a swim instructor all all summer and and lifeguard so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming and
 		um and since i worked at a recreation center i could uh  you know use those facilities quite often but
 		um
 	
 	
 		well swimming is uh one of the best exercises you can do
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean as far as for uh cardiovascular and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and there's and there's no jarring movements
 	
 	
 		and it's least least least hard on your body i
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		it's the least hard on your body as far as uh impact and
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah um fluid yeah fluid resistance
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		um-hum how about you
 	
 	
 		well i do uh
 		a little aerobics oh three or four times a week but it's not enough to
 		boy if i go the summer time i try to job jog a couple of miles and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i end you know even doing that three or four times a week
 		when summer hits that's a hard thing to go out and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and go jogging for uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		half hour or so but so i'm not quite getting the level that i need to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		do you do you kind of think it's a chore or do you enjoy it
 	
 	
 		i like it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i like it uh
 		part of my problem is i have small children so
 		oh to do a whole lot it just requires a lot of
 		oh coordination as far as scheduling and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that type of uh deal you know uh
 		when you're in college boy you get a hundred things going on course you're got a little different direction going but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh yeah uh i um i used to uh i i used to weigh uh two hundred fifteen pounds and now i only weigh about one  about one seventy five
 		um  so i drastically had to change the way i ate uh when i when i first moved to college and uh i i had started weight lifting quite regularly and
 		so i got my weight down and  it's kind of easy for me to  to forget about it now because uh you know when i'm not fat like i used to be uh you know i just don't worry about it you know
 	
 	
 		right you don't notice as much yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum although lately i have noticed you know even if i gain like two pounds i start i start feeling it and
 	
 	
 		you feel it don't you it's amazing how uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how much uh it changes and i weigh probably about the same i've weighed for
 		oh i don't know how many years but uh it's changed places and things don't fit just quite exactly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		fit the same
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh so do you do a uh
 		in Texas uh
 		there's a probably quite a few few facilities
 	
 	
 		yeah there are um i'm living in a dorm right now and so right downstairs there's a facility and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where all you know all we have to do is
 		is uh run down there and
 	
 	
 		do you enjoy it or is it uh
 	
 	
 		i really do if i have the time to
 	
 	
 		if you  can have find the time it's just the
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i really do because i like to get you know get off alone and just do that for a while but that's hard you know
 	
 	
 		yeah it is hard it is hard it's uh like anything else whether or not you wanna sacrifice another half hour my problem is i don't wanna wake up another half hour earlier
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and do more don't get enough sleep as it is right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh kind of have if you're having the pressures of school and uh everything else it's kind of course it's really you know as soon as you do it it's really a release
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you feel invigorated and you feel
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh you feel so in a lot better shape just like eating right foods
 	
 	
 		yeah ready to go another twelve hours yeah
 	
 	
 		if i eat too very much sugar boy it just does something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly um-hum
 	
 	
 		i do i have to be real careful
 	
 	
 		um-hum i stopped eating meat about oh uh
 		must have been eight months ago uh-huh completely i mean any kind of meat or
 	
 	
 		did you
 	
 	
 		and i and i really feel a lot better  now you that really does
 	
 	
 		makes a lot of difference well there's a lot of fat in meat
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah that's it i mean that's about where almost all of the fat comes from
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and so i found that really helps
 	
 	
 		right
 		and unless you really like uh fish
 		fish is pretty good for you but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i eat that i think i've eaten fish like twice since i used to eat a lot of fish too but  i just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happened
 	
 	
 		kind of see what happens i i've tried to do that with sugar and it
 	
 	
 		yeah and i like it and i
 		i  i don't know if i'm that brave yet
 	
 	
 		it's almost impossible everything has sugar in it
 		i mean if you go your ketchup has sugar in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		course and i like sugar too that's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's uh a problem but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		anyway well it's uh nice talking to you think we've uh covered all the subject
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay yeah it sounds good
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well good luck to you there in Idaho
 	
 	
 		well you too good luck uh enjoy college while you can let me tell you it's uh
 	
 	
 		well i'm in graduate school now i  i i kind of feel like i wish i could've gone back to undergraduate now  yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a little different uh challenge isn't it
