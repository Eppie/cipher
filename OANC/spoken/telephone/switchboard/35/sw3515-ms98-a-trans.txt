 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well do you do any recycling
 	
 	
 		um we do here um see what do we recycle we they recycle they have bins
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and um plastic bottles
 		and i think that's all they have
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		what about you guys
 	
 	
 		well we uh there's a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously  is uh aluminum cans
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh we've got a we've got a couple of different things uh places uh they're like unattended
 		aluminum can smashers  and you can go up there and and uh redeem we've got one that gives you like a penny a can
 	
 	
 		really for smashed cans
 	
 	
 		so if you yeah  well actually you have to give put them in there unsmashed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh when you do that it it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot
 	
 	
 		oh can you can you hold on for just a minute i'm gonna try pressing one again to make sure that i pressed it hard enough because okay just a second
 	
 	
 		sure
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		oh okay well i guess
 	
 	
 		well i heard it that i heard it that time
 	
 	
 		i guess
 		yeah okay well anyways you guys only get a penny a can well when you buy like um canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit
 	
 	
 		uh no you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly and so it's like they charge you for the deposit so when you turn in the cans unsmashed you're just like reimbursed
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay no they don't charge us that extra nickel
 	
 	
 		type of thing
 		that's sort of nice though
 	
 	
 		yeah it it really is really what happens is we just get a penny a can back
 		off the off the price if you wanna think of it that way so when we get like uh um a twelve pack then that's like twelve cents back
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah so you guys can actually get ahead
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh they have sort of like uh things that you can you're not like reimbursed for or paid for like we can recycle uh clear glass brown glass green glass
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um and milk jugs and um
 		newspapers you know everyone does newspapers
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah everybody does newspapers
 	
 	
 		but that that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they they said they can't be smashed or else um it doesn't fit in their little containers and they're not reimbursed by the the people who are over them or something
 	
 	
 		well shoot maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed uh Pepsi cans and whatever up there
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly yeah send it to this address no  but um  let's see they said that how ways we can encourage recycling um
 	
 	
 		i i i tell you what what really works uh at least down here is if there is if there is some even even some money basically to take care of the gas
 		to recycle it you know what i mean then people tend to do it uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		in other words uh taking care of the environment is is all well and good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but if it's gonna cost you to take care of the environment they're not quite as uh likely to do it as if uh as if you get something back for it
 	
 	
 		as likely to do it yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and uh so you know if there are some energy savings or if there's some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		you know it kind of reminds me of using an ATM card
 		you know to get money or doing your banking you know if it's free people will use it if it costs them something then they're not as likely to use it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		you know
 		but uh i know we had a problem down here with uh oil people taking oil out of their cars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and just putting it down the drain you know the sewer the drain sewer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh all that because there was apparently a lot of people you know every time they change the oil they just dump all the rest their old oil down there now they're starting to recycle that stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's good
 		um another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other
 		and  one way that we do it sort of in in Iowa is that
 		we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that way you know you don't get near enough as as much as you bought it for but you you got the use out of it and what you're gonna basically donate to to a Goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and so that's something that i've never i we're we're new to Iowa and so  that's something that i hadn't you know looked into before but that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah i know the a lot of places they um uh
