 		something about a food wasn't it uh-huh what was what was it exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well okay i heard it a lot of times i should know it by now um um talk about food and cooking and then it got into um what would uh i guess what foods would you serve at a dinner party
 		um and share a recipe if you have one or something like that
 	
 	
 		share a recipe huh i'll let you go first
 	
 	
 		oh i'm not much of a cook in fact i'm standing here going through a pile of stuff looking for my cookie cutters to do my Christmas cooking
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't give dinner parties the most extravagant i get is pizza for twenty but um  i don't know but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		well the thing i like at at most dinner parties i just i like vegetable trays yeah just the the you know dip with the  oh broccoli and cauliflower and  you know things like that well
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		a healthy person
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i think that both are good i like i like those and then i pretzels and things like that but  far as fancy recipes go though
 	
 	
 		well i'm impressed
 		no do you cook much
 	
 	
 		uh  well i'm in charge of the barbecue  i think that is pretty common once in a while i'll cook uh i'll cook Sunday dinner and we'll have uh
 	
 	
 		uh yeah right
 		uh-huh it is
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i have a very limited uh  group of things i can cook
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i will cook a pot roast too once in a while or  or uh
 		oh i've i've cooked the turkey before Thanksgiving but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm not much of a cook really
 	
 	
 		no well i'm not either i bought a precooked turkey for Thanksgiving yeah
 	
 	
 		oh is that right does that take long to just have to heat it up is that all oh
 	
 	
 		that's right  well it was one of those smoked ones so it was pretty good
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i never tried those
 	
 	
 		yeah it was pretty good it we got it we got it real cheap is why we got it and i'll probably do it next year to it saved an awful lot of work
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that
 		that turkey's about a three or four hour project you have to keep checking on it and see if that little thing pops up and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right see mine never came out good anyway so i figure  it's not gonna come out well i might as well not waste all my time on it and just get something
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum  oh what's worked well for us is put one of those um cooking bags that seems to have helped things a little bit yeah they just slip i guess you've seen them they're plastic
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah i've never really tried one though
 	
 	
 		and they don't they don't seem to melt obviously but uh they keep it uh warm moist and tender
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh-huh  hm  well i don't have much else to say on this topic
 	
 	
 		well this isn't my favorite well i'll be honest with you
 	
 	
 		i've gotten a i've gotten some interesting ones in the past i was just on a jury recently
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and the toof - days after i got off the jury one of my topics the first day was what do you think of juries and and the jury system and the next day was what do you think of capital punishment so it was pretty funny because i had a lot to say on that
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 		uh-huh i i work for a law firm so i probably could've responded to that one  you know
 	
 	
 		oh really well that's good well listen it was good talking to you and i hope your wife's feeling better
