 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		there we are
 	
 	
 		all right um um well uh tell me about the car that you've got
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i have a Honda um hatchback nineteen eighty four
 	
 	
 		and uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i had a hatchback a nineteen seventy eight version before this one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i'll be honest with you i have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and and uh put together and it it does its job
 		all i have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty five hundred miles and i i did have to put two front two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles
 		but that car just purrs like the day it was built i get forty two miles per gallon on the highway and right between twenty eight to thirty driving around in town it's a uh five speed straight stick machine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i can carry more in that uh that trunk area in my little Honda than i can in the big cars and i have a large um Pontiac
 		and i have a sixty nine Cougar which really is i'm saving because it's it's old but it's in beautiful shape
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i can carry as much in my Honda or more than i can in in those other bigger cars
 	
 	
 		well that's very interesting i've had i've had exactly the same experience with the one that i've got it's a and surprisingly it's also an eighty four
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and um
 	
 	
 		LX
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm still there
 		um i'm sorry what
 	
 	
 		it was an LX
 	
 	
 		yes it's an LX it's not a hatchback but it's um it's uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yours is a four door
 	
 	
 		four door yeah and very very comfortable car big roomy trunk uh and uh and very happy with it and i must admit it's you know if if if uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah my only consideration were were you know buying another car just to tool around town and and make you know brief trips and things like that i i would very very seriously consider buying one
 		uh i think they're extraordinarily reliable cars um my my real concern with with uh
 	
 	
 		yes we are
 	
 	
 		uh why i'm not sure i i want to buy a Honda is because i have to make a kind of a a steady um trip down the road
 		about once a month because i'm divorced and i have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina and uh
 	
 	
 		well hm
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i drive down interstate ninety five and it's just an absolutely wild highway
 	
 	
 		ninety five is wild in any car there's no doubt about that
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 	
 	
 		because i i i run over to Crystal City or used to i'm retiring the end of this month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there
 	
 	
 		and you well you've got it and uh so having precious cargo in the car with me
 		as you can well imagine it's very hard for me to imagine that that uh a Honda's going to be as safe a car as as the one that i've got got my eye on which is a Volvo
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		in in fact  quite frankly i've owned a Volvo in the past and uh i've i've they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've found that i've had a lot of luck with them uh course i'm a mechanically inclined kind of person and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that
 		you know need to be taken care of and so forth and i guess that's one thing that that recommends the Honda to a lot of people is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood and
 	
 	
 		yes it just just sits there and purrs and you all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter i get six hundred miles on a tank of gas
 	
 	
 		oh i know it's really amazing
 	
 	
 		yeah beautiful beautiful machine
 	
 	
 		it's
 		absolutely incredible
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so um yeah anyway i've been looking at the prices of these cars and and and so forth and i think that it's it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to
 	
 	
 		is that right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		buy ones that are about the vintage of the the cars that you and i currently own
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		well a brand new Volvo costs what thirty thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		well certainly some of the top end ones you can still get get uh even the the low end wagons um for less than twenty thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we get you know in the Washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any any week and i sort of you know scan the paper and look at them and so forth and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um  anyway and that's that's the other thing is that i've i've never really been too terribly much of a new car person i think i've bought one or two new cars in my life and i've tended to um
 		to uh buy cars that are you know two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old this Honda that i have i bought used and
 		in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it i've just rolled seventy thousand miles and it's a seventy four i mean an eighty four so
 	
 	
 		well my my eighty eighty four just has seventy seven on it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach Virginia where my mother lives and things like that and i drive it
