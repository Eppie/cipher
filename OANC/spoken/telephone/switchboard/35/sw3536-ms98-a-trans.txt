 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what magazines do you subscribe to Lori
 	
 	
 		well we have probably too many  we've got not enough to keep up i mean too many to keep up with we get uh Forbes Fortune Newsweek
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Southern Living Texas Highways and National Geographic i think i think i've got them all
 	
 	
 		oh gosh yeah
 		uh-huh well i i take um right now i've kind of a whittled mine down i just take Vanity Fair and uh Harper's and uh Houston City magazine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you know how i used to subscribe to Texas Highways that's one of the best magazines for the money going
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean it's such a bargain what what i mean what is it like twelve dollars a year
 	
 	
 		it is
 		something like that yeah
 	
 	
 		and then the photography's beautiful
 	
 	
 		it is
 	
 	
 		yeah it's matter that's i thought about it not too long ago that uh  i had seen an issue and i thought gosh i ought to give my parents that for Christmas but i of course now it's Christmas i haven't done it so maybe next year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i know i had i had uh found myself about i don't know two years ago
 		in the in a situation where i i literally had more magazines coming in than i could read and i thought this is crazy so i
 	
 	
 		right
 		you know it's not so bad if they're monthly publications but like Newsweek which i really enjoy um comes out every week and so it's really hard to keep up with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well i i took Time for i guess ten years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i enjoyed it and it and i it you know it has just you know a wealth of information i mean it's therefore similar to Newsweek
 		but whenever i got to the point that i just i just finally said this is just insane because i had so many magazines i let them all lapse
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then once they were all gone and of course that took a while i didn't realize how much i had paid up on some of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh then i decided well i you know Vanity Fair offered me a special thing to come back at a reduced rate you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then Harper's did and so i you know little by little i've i've you know subscribed to a few more again  but uh i take the newspaper everyday
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i've got plenty of reading material
 	
 	
 		yeah well we get the newspaper on the weekends and that seems to be enough
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		because we'll just turn on the news otherwise and see see what the latest is
 	
 	
 		well you sound though kind of like me though but i mean it's i'm i have
 		always plenty of reading material around my house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when i go to visit my brother and sister-in-law in Austin it drives me crazy because i i always have to be sure and put something in my suitcase to read because honestly i wonder these people don't ever read
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean their house just a you know it's just it's it's appalling to me they have nothing to read
 	
 	
 		well maybe that's what you ought to get them for Christmas
 	
 	
 		yeah really well uh well actually i think one year uh several years ago i did give them a a subscription to Time and they never said a word about it you know and so i thought well maybe they weren't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really i'd
 		they're not into that
 	
 	
 		maybe they weren't into it you know that's fine but it's just it's so different than
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i just i require reading material that's all that is to it
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yeah um
 		you know one thing i hate i don't know if this is really on the subject but when they call you the different places call you to sign up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		at this you know and they try to give you this big bargain and and you're like no we already subscribe to enough magazines at the time and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah well i um  you know i had as a matter of fact the the Vanity Fair whenever i let it lapse
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they had sent me all these you know final notice things and i just you know didn't send them back in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so finally once i did decide to subscribe again
 		i sent in a a thing that said hey you know i mean it was whatever the the uh subscription rate was i think like fifteen dollars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and  about a month later i got a thing in the mail saying well hey as a former subscriber you can now get it for twelve and they had a one eight hundred number i called up and i said hey i want three bucks back
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right
 	
 	
 		so they extended they said they were gonna extend my subscription for three months but they're pretty competitive
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 		but um i find at times
 		i have numerous magazines piled up  and i'll just sit down you know one weekend or something and try to catch up on them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i mean i you know i enjoy it i guess you know um
 		as far as comparing that to other media it's so much easier to listen to either the radio or to watch TV to listen i mean to know what's going on rather than to read an article
 	
 	
 		oh it is it is and it just but at the same time you can  you can get information i mean there there
 	
 	
 		in a magazine
 	
 	
 		the variety and you can get different types of information and and you know television is is geared so much to
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		the average Joe Blow and quite frankly i mean there there are items of interest to me that you'll never find on television
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah that's true the other thing is um some magazines
