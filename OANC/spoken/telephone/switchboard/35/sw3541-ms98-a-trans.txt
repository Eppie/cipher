 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		you think you're getting your money's worth
 	
 	
 		uh never
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		uh the only thing i'm i'm thankful of is that we don't have to pay any income tax here in in Texas
 	
 	
 		well that's probably the next year's agenda
 	
 	
 		yeah boy i tell you what i sure hope they don't pass something like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they're finding the way the tax you every time you turn around and i i think one way or the other we're gonna
 		pay for the bureaucracy i guess
 		and uh
 		it's one area that's uh really i i think hurting the economy more than anything i think the taxes have just
 		every time you turn around they they have taking more bite out of the
 		dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products and i i i think that is probably
 		as big a item fueling the recession as anything
 		right now
 	
 	
 		well i i tell you um i remember every time it seems like we turned around they're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and  actually that one the the the taxes on gasoline don't don't bug me as much as uh uh what are we eight and a quarter percent sales tax
 	
 	
 		yep that's right
 	
 	
 		and every time you go to buy anything now uh even though you know they they tax food that's the one that really kind of bothers me
 	
 	
 		well i think that uh that the problem with the sales tax of course is it's an unfair tax across the board
 		uh as far as ability to pay which allegedly allegedly allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards
 		but uh now people with the
 		lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of you know taxes on everything they buy
 		and where people that make
 		you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they aren't going to be paying taxes on you know
 		and uh
 		that's the unfair equity inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue but i don't think it is anymore not in Texas anyway
 	
 	
 		oh i got you because people that uh don't make very much money wind up spending it all
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		and whatever they spent it on they have to pay tax on
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		and that's the unfairness of the thing but uh
 		i think taxes generally are unfair
 	
 	
 		what what do you think of that new luxury car tax anything over ten thousand or thirty thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		well you know
 		like other things if they don't affect you you don't worry about them too much
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i
 		i have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still so uh it doesn't
 		i i think uh
 		uh you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is uh you know and uh
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		i guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car uh that's their
 		prerogative you know  i i i don't have a whole lot of sympathy on that you you maybe you buy that you know and i don't mean to be knocking uh
 	
 	
 		no uh no i haven't but it it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax
 		uh on top of it and there's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand
 	
 	
 		yeah there are there are and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that i guess you know unless they really want it buy something that
 		you know
 		more
 		well it it's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids you know it's a way of
 		increasing the population that that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on on federal taxes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and where you exempt things like uh uh one of the best things i heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably Lloyd Bentsen
 		said that all you know if they gave back the ah deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		now i don't know if that's true or not but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and you know any any kind of
 		interest that you're paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchases
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they don't you know to a degree
 		well like booze you know example they keep raising the taxes on booze it gets to the point
 		you know it makes drunks sober you know they quit buying anything
 	
 	
 		well what what about the taxes on cigarettes
