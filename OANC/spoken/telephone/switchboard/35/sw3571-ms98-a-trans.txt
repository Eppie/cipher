 		Lori i think we know about the weather had a lot of rain this year though
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 		yeah that's true lot of records i think
 	
 	
 		yeah i know it i just don't know what winter's gonna be like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh hasn't been bad so far
 	
 	
 		no it hadn't but i mean we're due for a a big one here we hadn't had a big
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		big winter in a long time
 	
 	
 		well yeah i guess not
 		well  how about somewhere else you been somewhere else lately
 	
 	
 		somewhere else where was i i was in Florida here recently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and what was the weather like there
 	
 	
 		great  it was fantastic
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you wanna go back right
 	
 	
 		yeah sure i wouldn't mind going back
 	
 	
 		did it rain every day it usually rains every day there
 	
 	
 		no it didn't really didn't they got maybe sprinkled maybe once i remember that's about it
 	
 	
 		really
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 		did you go to uh what is it Disney World
 	
 	
 		no i was down there on business but we were right across the street from it
 	
 	
 		oh oh really and you didn't get to go huh have you been there before
 	
 	
 		no never went
 		no never have
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh have you been to the one in California
 	
 	
 		my
 		no my kids were the one to the one in uh out in California
 	
 	
 		
 
 		gosh we have to go  it's just one of those things you have to see you know
 	
 	
 		i know
 		that's what i heard think we're straying off the weather though
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		yeah
 		hum boy we can't go very far with this subject
 	
 	
 		i don't know i what kind of winter winter are we gonna have this year
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know hopefully not too bad well bad enough so it kills all the fleas and bugs and whatever see we have to have our freeze for probably a week
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but aside from that i hope it's still warm
 		not too cold maybe maybe maybe well maybe a little snow on Christmas Eve or something would be nice but it doesn't look good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they were saying that the freeze last winter did you see i don't know if you saw on TV about the uh the migration uh not the migration but all the crickets that they had this year
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		did you see it they were saying they were saying that was caused from a very mild winter
 	
 	
 		oh it was amazing
 	
 	
 		that that the winter didn't that the winter did not kill all of the eggs like it normally does
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but i was out  i work out in Plano at a restaurant out there and they just uh i mean the my whole building was covered with them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh what restaurant is it
 	
 	
 		i hope
 	
 	
 		oh okay all right i work out in Plano too i was just wondering if it was near where i am
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but i mean it it was it was i couldn't i couldn't believe all of them
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember going to work one day and just crunching on the stairs it was terrible
 	
 	
 		oh it was unbelievable we couldn't see our parking we couldn't see our parking lot hey i'm not i'm not kidding we got pictures of it we could not see our parking lot
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's pretty bad for a restaurant i guess probably doesn't help your business
 	
 	
 		yeah it is well it didn't it well it didn't hurt it though that's the bad thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		didn't hurt it they weren't on the inside they were just on the outside of the building just hanging around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh well it's in here we started to get some in the house now i i wonder if it's because it's getting cool out  and they want to come in
 	
 	
 		yeah they want to they go towards the heat that's why that's why they were coming out of the ground when it first started getting cool they came out of the ground because it was warmer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes
 		and into the house
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah they like coming into the house but they were going crawling crawling up our building up into the eave where it was warm
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh huh
 	
 	
 		where the lights were and everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but hopefully uh we'll have a nice hard winter and it'll kill them all this year because i don't wanna put up with that again
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i know i mean it sounds cool to say but yeah it was pretty
 	
 	
 		uh a bug's a bug who cares
 	
 	
 		and i ended up spraying for them anyway after a while i think
 	
 	
 		oh we spent a couple of thousand dollars on getting the getting the restaurant sprayed and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet you do huh you probably have to do that a lot of times during the year don't you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well we get we spray monthly just as just as a maintenance but uh i mean this was like every other day he was coming out there with his truck he normally doesn't spray with a truck
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 		hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he was having to come out there with a big truck and uh just douse the douse the grass and everything else
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow yeah i guess you'd have to you don't want bugs in there that's for sure um
 	
 	
 		oh i know it
 		but i'm i'm ready for a little snow though got to have a little bit couple of days anyway  maybe shut shut down shut down work but i doubt it maybe where i can stay home a few days and and play in the snow with the kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah it would be nice
 		
 
 		yeah that would be nice
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm looking forward to it i don't know about anybody else
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 		well as long as i don't have to drive in it
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		that's that's the lousy part
 	
 	
 		yeah i know and Texans don't know how to drive in it anyway
 	
 	
 		oh well i'm not from here but yeah i never really did learn  so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well i don't know what else we can talk about the weathe r
 	
 	
 		well
 		i don't um probably nothing
 	
 	
 		yeah it's getting cool now i got a fire going so i'm enjoying it yeah
 	
 	
 		oh sounds good well listen i enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		enjoyed talking to you too
 	
 	
 		and uh i hope we get a better subject next time or or at least someone on the other side of the country so that you really can ask
 	
 	
 		i i i know it
 		well the maybe if they're listening to this maybe if they when they listen to this maybe they can set that up a little better
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's probably just whoever is around or has the right hours on their sheet so they can call because it's getting hard to find people now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh i know it that's true
 	
 	
 		takes a long time and this was good i mean you were only the second one they called
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but sometimes i've had to wait
