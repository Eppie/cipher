 
     		
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		do you do you have uh some strong feelings one way or the other about about the care of the elderly
 	
 	
 		well yes i do um this is a a question that hit pretty close to home uh i had to go through this with my dad about
 		four years ago he was his health was failing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh he was adamant about two things one was that i take care of my mother and two that he not be put into a home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we talked  about some length and i respected his wishes he uh
 		stayed at home as long as he could and then uh he died in a hospital but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think that my position was is that uh you you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care of the
 		of their uh of their clients
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um
 		because i've heard about the many abuses and because he had heard of so many abuses he just didn't want that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well  my graduate work is in speech pathology
 		and uh so so uh i've thought about this more than once uh you know dealing with
 		uh  you know i'm concerned we're gonna have a geriatric uh population in in twenty years it's gonna be you know phenomenal
 	
 	
 		yeah almost thirty all all over thirty percent isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah  uh  and um but i have been amazed and and in talking with uh some of my fellow students
 		it looks as though um nursing homes are not going to be the only option anymore and uh  in twenty years
 		uh where a lot of students are hoping uh to work as an in the home type uh uh approach approach where
 		where the uh where there's the speech you know the speech therapist or whether it's a nursing uh specialist or someone plans to uh work
 		out of a family's home and take the responsibility away from the family but yet allow the the loved one to stay you know at home with the family members  uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it  it's it's difficult for many families especially in the case of uh of of Alzheimer's and and uh some of the more degenerative diseases to uh say
 		uh uh leave them to to have them at home because then the family becomes completely uh
 	
 	
 		they're captives
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah and and did did you experience that with your with your father or not
 	
 	
 		uh we had a at one stage we had care somewhat like like what you're talking about we had the Visiting Nurses Program
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they sent somebody in and it it was a a nominal charge that this uh
 		it started out the lady would come in i think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they would try to get him to exercise they would try to uh you know they would check him over temperature
 		you know the basic checks
 		try to get him to talk and be motivated and uh that's what we went through
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh up to a points things seemed to be working and then i i think he he became discouraged
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they did not know how to take care of that and then um at that point i think it mostly a psychological problem
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh but yes i agree there's a lot of options there could be a lot of options
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think it's time that uh we decide to do something about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		definitely you know uh one of the other subjects on the on the switchboard and this is one that i've that i've been thinking applies here uh  where where uh
 		young ones young
 		kids uh graduating from high school whether they should do a community service type work this would be an excellent example of somewhere uh someplace where
 		um the community could be more involved  you know more than just leaving it only to professionals there is a lot the communiky the community can do to uh enhance the or or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home
 	
 	
 		i suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need
 	
 	
 		possibly before i don't know now
 	
 	
 		yeah the church or synagogue whatever because typically these were close-knit groups at one time but in today's large metropolitan areas or even
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in most even even the rural areas now people are not quite as close as they once were
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		uh the mobility factor the factor that uh
 		oh we're living longer and
 		people are less trusting all these things tend to destroy this type of system but i agree with you it it might be some possibilities there
 		although dealing with geriatrics
 		is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do
 	
 	
 		oh i agree that's a that's a good point
 	
 	
 		i think they would have to have some training some
