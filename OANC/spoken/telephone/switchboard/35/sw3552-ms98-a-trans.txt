 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		well what kind of music do you like Beverly
 	
 	
 		well i play piano and organ and have since i was a child and i sing in church choir and have done that since i was a child and still sing now
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		and uh i play cello
 		in high school and college and occasionally play as an adult but i don't have a cello and i rarely ever practice so it's like adult groups that's i teach school adult groups at school or something when they are in dire need of somebody
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i still pick it up occasionally
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh my son is a music major he's uh in performing French horn he was an all state French horn player all through high school and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so there's a lot of music in our family
 	
 	
 		well that's terrific i think it's wonderful that you got that that you play an instrument that you passed it on to your children  i uh  um as as a child reluctantly took piano  for for uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess three years  and you know  looking back i'm i'm really happy that i had that experience because certainly i i learned some basics about music that i would've been completely ignorant of had i not had those lessons
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i i wish now of course you know in  in hindsight that i had  uh uh uh kept it up but i didn't but nonetheless i i do have some uh rudimentary knowledge of uh
 		the scales and the keys and the chords and et cetera
 	
 	
 		um-hum  do you do anything with music nowadays
 	
 	
 		other than buy it  prerecorded
 	
 	
 		no  you you buy it and listen to it huh
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah and and uh what i i i am kind of i've got a real nice stereo system that i've invested too much money in and you know all the latest gadgets and but i do enjoy good music
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i've got quite a wide uh
 		repertoire  i mean i've i've got everything from classical to jazz or rock and roll to blues i mean it's just i i cover the whole gamut and it depends on the mood i'm in uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and for instance Sunday mornings with coffee and the newspaper i  for some reason like to listen to classical music  and uh other times it you know just something completely different will strike me i i like almost everything except rap
 	
 	
 		i i do too i don't really care that much for rap  the only thing i i've liked
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		with rap is is when the kids at school uh will take information and they'll learn it by making a rap out of it and then i think it's useful otherwise i don't have any use for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's  it's the first time something that has come along that makes me feel  that you know i am obviously of another generation this is a there's gap between me and rap music  and  i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i understand
 	
 	
 		you know that's just i don't relate to it at all but then again i'm that's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it it's definitely a a huge hit with the younger people
 	
 	
 		they seem to like it
 	
 	
 		they do
 	
 	
 		well my eldest son took piano for  oh about four years and lost interest but he learned enough that he can still sit down and play and enjoys doing that and has a keyboard
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then my daughter uh took piano for a while she also played bassoon and then she  has taken dance well she took dance from the time she was about five
 		on up through first part of college and
 		she got so involved in dance and that sort of thing that she let the instruments kind of slide behind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and but yet she still enjoys uh music and still enjoys dance and you know for exercise she wants aerobics to music and that you know that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well you sound like you've got a very talented family
 	
 	
 		well they do have quite a bit of musical ability which is is nice uh we do enjoy good music and uh
 		like  however uh with the kids going through college and we have two in college right now they are the ones that have the stereos we we don't seem to have much stereo one of these days we will
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh it
 		yeah yeah really well um uh  uh what was i gonna ask i was there was a question that's on the tip of my oh yeah  as far as a voice did you ever have any uh uh voice coach either or lessons
 	
 	
 		the the only ones that i ever had were actually through the church where they had uh
 	
 	
 		or
 	
 	
 		a voice teacher uh offer lessons at sort of at a discount you might say for members of the choir who were interested so i did that a couple of times
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but as far as as any other training no i just it was uh what i learned through singing in choirs and um  my other music piano and the organ and the cello
 	
 	
 		a friend of mine the reason i ask a friend of mine and her sister  both took voice for oh i guess three or four years  and they sing like angels they have the most they you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they're just beautiful and i wonder how much of it is innate talent and how much of that is a a function of of how much they've learned and and retained
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well there has to be some talent there there has to be some voice
 	
 	
 		something to work with
 	
 	
 		something to work with right i mean you can only overcome so much but there are tricks to make
 	
 	
 		right
