 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well let's see my husband does the majority of the um the uh gardening um taking care of the lawn and fertilizing but i um tend to all the
 		planting the annuals and and the spraying and um taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in you know throughout that season and
 		later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and um  any kind of decorating for the holidays you know i'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for Halloween and
 		Christmas but basically he does all the heavy stuff and i do all the fun stuff
 	
 	
 		well we have it just opposite here
 		my wife works in you know at at at the TI and she's uh sedentary all day long
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so when she gets home she likes to mow
 	
 	
 		i say
 	
 	
 		and we have about ten acres and she tries to mow about half of it
 	
 	
 		wow
 		wow that's a a big job
 	
 	
 		well yeah it keeps uh well it's doing real well because when we got this place the the dirt was just overgrazed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean you know it was bare dirt in a lot of places
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and now you know since we've been mowing it and you know of course we water a little bit
 		but that's just too much to water all at once but
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we've reclaimed a lot of it
 	
 	
 		oh i bet it's beautiful
 	
 	
 		yeah but we don't do much in the way of uh flowers we have one little flower garden that we that we work with the rest of it is just like wild flowers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		wild flowers
 	
 	
 		and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they're about oh i guess a third the size of your palm of your hand
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh that sounds lovely
 	
 	
 		and
 		of course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh the wild flowers are beautiful i think um i was thinking about throwing some for in the back just where the kids um just way in the back behind the swing sets so that
 		just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved
 	
 	
 		yeah well my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh she enjoys mowing i can't believe it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i know a lot of uh-huh a lot of women do uh um i've just never really you know maybe one of these days i'll have to get out there and mow but
 	
 	
 		i mean i hate it
 	
 	
 		my husband takes  that and i'll help rake up the grass and um sometimes i'll help him edge um because we don't have that much property but we're on a corner lot so there's a lot of edging to do and um
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		uh that's what's nice about living more in the country you don't have to worry about any of that
 	
 	
 		we don't even have any concrete or asphalt
 	
 	
 		oh oh that's nice i this is different for us because the other
 		the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks and um it's been a little more country with the trees and we do miss that um if we had a chance to move i think we'd move back to somewhere that it
 		was little more countrified and a little less maintenance required
 	
 	
 		yeah but you know we do everything together this this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the actually this fall what am i talking about two weeks ago
 	
 	
 		as as far as that goes
 		um-hum
 		wow
 	
 	
 		we got a thousand pine trees from the you know soil and conservation people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we're in the process of of planting
 	
 	
 		wow that's a
 	
 	
 		and we're building a stand uh just to the north
 		and along the east uh property line
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i uh i think what we're what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i'll tell you in winter time when that wind when that wind comes out of the north
 		it just cuts right through you like you're not even there
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so
 		on the other side of the house though that's where we have all the the delicate flowers and the mums and we have morning glory and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers
 	
 	
 		well i took
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of water and we get hummingbirds come in the spring you know all summer long
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		oh that sounds so pretty
 	
 	
 		and well when we leave the doors open they fly in the house
 	
 	
 		oh really do they don't do any damage though they just fly right back out if you have the
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well yeah they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat
 	
 	
 		i say
 	
 	
 		and when you're as busy as one of those babies you got to eat most of the time
 	
 	
 		i say
 	
 	
 		and we've got a few you know we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know for the most part gardening for us is well we got asparagus and uh we've got some plum trees and some apple trees
 		and some tomato
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and some blackberries and strawberries man we get the best strawberries that you just can't believe
 	
 	
 		oh oh that sounds wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah we just got our last tomatoes
 	
 	
 		oh i love home grown grown tomatoes there's nothing like them they just don't have the same ones in the supermarket
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well these are accidental tomatoes
 	
 	
 		what does that mean accidental tomatoes
 	
 	
 		well last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes course you're gonna lose some that way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the seeds go right through them
 	
 	
 		i say
 	
 	
 		and wherever they pooped
