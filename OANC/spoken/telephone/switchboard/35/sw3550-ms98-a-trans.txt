 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay go ahead
 	
 	
 		all right
 		well what kind of car would i wanna buy i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the question is i mean would i want to buy or would i would i probably actually buy may be two different things
 	
 	
 		oh well if you if you had all your all the money in the world or something i don't
 	
 	
 		if i had all the money i wanted then that's whole different matter yeah uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no the car in in that case i'd i'd i don't know
 		i i my dream car for years was a was a Porsche Turbo Carrera
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know if i'd want one of those now well i of course i would want one if somebody was was giving it to me but i maybe would buy a BMW
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		or or even a Volvo
 	
 	
 		what do you have now
 	
 	
 		i've got a a uh a Dodge Daytona
 	
 	
 		um-hum  hm
 	
 	
 		it's actually the first car we ever bought new and everything
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah we just we well i have my car is the first one we ever bought new too but we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what
 		uh-huh me yeah me too  so so what car do you drive what is it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um mine is a Honda Accord and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we almost bought one of those do you like it
 	
 	
 		yeah i do and and um it's funny because after i bought it i was doing a lot of business traveling and i some of the cars that i got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i didn't like them as well except it wasn't really fair comparison because those were automatics and mine is a standard and the reason i got a standard was because i thought it handled a lot better it had a lot more pickup and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah you get a little more control over when it when it's doing the things it's doing yeah um  so what what rental agency did you go to to actually rent to to rent those kind of cars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um usually Avis
 	
 	
 		to what Avis really
 	
 	
 		Avis yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		huh i guess
 	
 	
 		well it's just because we're on uh i think of it i'm not sure if those are Avis or not but we have corporate contracts
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		you know with the various companies so it depends on your destination too it's kind of strange
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		you work for a big company then
 	
 	
 		work for TI um-hum which is how i heard about this
 	
 	
 		TI i
 		uh-huh um but  yeah i i uh
 		i don't know i i would probably if i were to buy a car myself you know and with the constraints of the real of the of real money i probably would would
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		go with something like you you know like the Honda Accord maybe it would it one thing i i really liked about about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have uh um  this seven year warranty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		um and it really saved us some big money once
 	
 	
 		it did wow
 	
 	
 		yeah they had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and uh the bill would've been over fifteen hundred dollars and i had to pay twenty five for the
 	
 	
 		oh that is great that's unusual to hear usually you know if something breaks you look at the warranty and it's excluded
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well the well we we bought the extended the the extension
 	
 	
 		oh i see okay
 	
 	
 		and uh at the time we bought it it was like you know it was i don't know four hundred and twenty five dollars or something extra
 	
 	
 		oh well you got your money's worth
 	
 	
 		yeah we did but you know we really debated at the beginning and of of course i'm glad i did it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that is good
 	
 	
 		but um we still have we still have like you know couple three years left on it
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've been lucky mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		but i was real lucky because it just hit the um the lens to the light it didn't actually dent the car or anything so it cost me twenty five bucks to replace that
 	
 	
 		bumper
 		oh
 		well that's good are
 	
 	
 		and the store will pay for it anyway so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		no big deal
 	
 	
 		um if you were if you were going to uh buy a new car would you buy another uh another Accord
 	
 	
 		um i probably wouldn't just because we already have one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you know if i had to make the choice again i yeah i'd i'm perfectly happy with what i decided um although we did just buy another car and that's a Legend um but it's it's a used one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah those are nice and
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um my husband has really wanted one for a long time and the fact that you know this car this car that i have has performed so well and before that i also had an Accord it was a real old one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i bought that used i had absolutely no money to my name and bought that and it served me real well too so he's been impressed with all the Honda cars
 	
 	
 		hm
 		right
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		yeah my sister drives one she drives a uh um i don't know is it Legend it's uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh i'm not certain though  but she's liked it um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i i have i have never had and we  in fact what i'm driving right now we bought a
 		we only had one car for a long time and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth you know from four miles to work and back kind of thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so uh i bought a used Yugo just to be a little you know a little car that i could care less about just waste yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		how did it go for you
 	
 	
 		oh well it's uh it's worked you know it i mean it's exactly what it is you know it's just a it's a cheap lit tle you know little car just to go you know running run around town in and uh
 	
 	
 		hasn't left you stranded
 		yeah i know
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's actually kind of fun to drive i i i you know getting back in the Daytona now i almost don't like it you know it's just like too too mushy and it you know it's it's an automatic and the
 	
 	
 		really
 		huh well that's what my husband thinks about my car now that he's had the Legend it's wimpy
 	
 	
 		it's too it's the steering is just you know you feel like you're in a boat or something you know it's kind of
 	
 	
 		i can't drive that the Legend it's just so huge i i don't like it and it's so uh
 	
 	
 		oh
