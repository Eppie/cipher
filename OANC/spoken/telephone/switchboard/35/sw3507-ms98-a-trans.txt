 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		this area Dallas
 	
 	
 		i'm born and raised here
 	
 	
 		well great so who you want to talk about baseballwise
 	
 	
 		may
 		may as well talk about the Rangers
 	
 	
 		the Rangers all right
 	
 	
 		uh uh
 		might as well
 	
 	
 		well do you think they're going to get anyone in Florida
 	
 	
 		uh i hope i hope they do they've uh i forgot who've they signed already
 	
 	
 		did they sign that shortstop that was
 		they were talking about some shortstop they were going to try to get in the free agency draft
 		or the free agency market
 	
 	
 		i don't know who they uh they they decide sign finally signed up Brian Downing i know
 	
 	
 		for
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		they're they're trying to get uh God what's his name what's that black man's name uh
 	
 	
 		is he with them now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Ruben
 	
 	
 		Ruben yeah they haven't they still haven't signed Ruben yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i heard that they're not going to talk to him till next week's now they talked to his agents today and then they're going to talk to them some more next week which i don't know whether that's good bad or indifferent because
 		wish they'd get that out of the way and maybe he could do something else
 	
 	
 		yeah i know well they said they made a mistake they made a mistake by  uh
 		not signing not signing him uh to a longer contract than what they did
 	
 	
 		i know why do you think they did that
 	
 	
 		oh they did did did it for economics but it's coming back and it's going to haunt them this year because he played such good ball the last couple of years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because now his uh his contracts say they i think they signed him for like three or four hundred thousand last year but now it's going to cost them somewhere about uh eight hundred thousand to a million  is kind of
 	
 	
 		oh
 		you don't think he'll get that twenty seven million like that other guy just got
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
 
 		i don't think so i don't he'll he's it's it's going to cost them though
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's going to cost them but he's worth it
 	
 	
 		that's true well do you think they need to fire Bobby
 	
 	
 		Valentine's a good guy i don't know if he's i don't know he's he's done a lot for the team
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he really has i think he's an excellent i think he's an excellent coach he's probably one of the best ones that they've had just because he's more consistent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he's more consistent than any other coach that we've had and had there in a long time and i i think he'll do some good he just needs a they just need to put together a good pitching staff and i think they'll go pretty good
 	
 	
 		not have so many injuries
 	
 	
 		yeah that was that's what killed them last year i went to a few went to a few of their games and it just uh the pitching was okay but it was
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		it was inconsistent
 	
 	
 		are you comfortable that Bobby Witt will be back
 		or is he
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		ever going to develop into a super pitcher
 	
 	
 		uh i don't think he is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't think he is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what about Kevin Brown
 	
 	
 		Kevin Brown uh he might he might he still he's still got a little learning to do
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought maybe he would but i was kind of disappointed last year
 	
 	
 		yeah i was disappointed the whole season so  they they they started out i mean if they would have continued they went off that fourteen game losing streak or winning streak then they kind of hit the dumps there for a while
 	
 	
 		well they
 		yeah
 		yeah but then all their pitchers were hurt so that that really hurts when you can't
 		when all of the pitchers get hurt like that so
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true you think they're going to do anything this year
 	
 	
 		i don't know i uh
 		uh i think they need a another arm
 		and i'm still not sure that that new third baseman Dean Palmer is as good as they think he's going to be
 	
 	
 		i think they made a mistake they made a mistake trading Buechele uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		well i don't think they uh think they knew they couldn't afford
 		him and Ruben and they decided to go with Ruben because he
 	
 	
 		yeah that's probably true but uh you know you got to you got to have more not one person's going to make the team
 	
 	
 		yeah but they're not willing to pay big bucks it doesn't seem i think they'll have an exciting team last next next year and i just you know if they don't have any injuries but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh Kansas City you know just signed a big time player so they're they're tough at signing all those people they got uh Joiner Wally Joiner from California so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that should help their team
 	
 	
 		yeah it sounds like you keep up on baseball pretty well
 	
 	
 		no i have one of those uh minds that remembers trivia that's of completely useless
 	
 	
 		that what useless trivia
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i mean something important i can't remember but something about baseball or football or something that really doesn't mean anything i can remember it's one of those
 		weird things i don't know why you know and i can't find my car keys then but i can remember
 		you know something that
 		about sports that's not even important
 	
 	
 		remember remember who Kansas City signed but you can't find your car keys
 	
 	
 		that's right or my glasses  yeah i know and and why why do i remember sports it's just one of those things i don't know why that if i can hear it on the radio and it just sinks in and
 	
 	
 		that
 		that's great
 		well that's great i've never i've never had a decent conversation with a woman about baseball
 	
 	
 		well
 		well that's that's a yeah oh that's that's embarrassing almost but no i could probably name them almost the starting lineup for the Rangers
 	
 	
 		until until now
