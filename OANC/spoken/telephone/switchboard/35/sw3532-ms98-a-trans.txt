 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay you know what happens is
 		i've tried i was out because of surgery last week so i tried calling a couple of eight o'clock calls and i got a person from Utah and a person from New York and a person from New Jersey so i thought
 		sort of need her calling really early in the morning
 	
 	
 		early in the morning and you got somebody from Dallas uh well i'm from Mesquite
 	
 	
 		out of town
 		so  that's why that's why i've been making been making it a habit of calling in the morning
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but anyway uh
 		the topic was the
 		most important benefit of your job today besides salary and how satisfied are you and everything i'm sort of self-employed so uh i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well i am too for the first time in my life um-hum
 	
 	
 		really i'd be at a a little loss for words on this as far as i'm concerned most definitely uh most important benefit today would be hospitalization and of course retirement and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i've worked for a large Fortune 500 company before and have had the luxury of uh benefits and um at a very  small cost
 		and uh  then got out on my own through no fault of my own i was with Safeway and they left the country  or left the um north part of the state
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i find myself in the insurance industry
 		and i am finding i although i don't sell group insurance or major medical i sell supplemental health i'm finding that every place i go to talk to them about my product
 		it's they're in such a dilemma about um the major medical group market right now it's just not very desirable
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that's very true i can understand that because
 		i'm a just a small business person i run a
 		my company has five people but uh they're all straight commission salesmen so they all provide their own
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		insurance and it's been that way since nineteen seventy four and my office is just a one person office i have myself plus my secretary and she comes in at nine leaves at five and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		she's on her husband's insurance program and i just uh
 	
 	
 		so you're fortunate in that manner
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well um i think some of the benefits that are being made available nowadays like the 401K to the employees
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um is beneficial i was not a participant or that was not available when i was employed
 		but uh i did participate in a stock program and uh
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		and that really worked out well for me when i had been with the company for thirteen years and now have a a you know a small retirement set aside which is
 		allows me to go on commission sales
 		and um and do it you know comfortably
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat are you married
 	
 	
 		uh no i'm not
 	
 	
 		okay well i'm married and my wife's a school teacher so i'm on her they have pretty good insurance so i they she carries me on her insurance program which works out real well
 	
 	
 		they really do
 		what uh school district is she in
 	
 	
 		she's in the Plano School District in Plano
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's not cheap it's like all insurance insurance just keeps on going up more and more every day and course the uh
 		the prices they're charging today and because of the problems they have
 	
 	
 		exactly and the deductibles are going up and that
 	
 	
 		oh deductibles are high
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's one of the reasons my um the what my product is just getting more and more popular because it's a catastrophic
 		cancer insurance intensive care and a daily hospital indemnity and so those kinds of things not only help a person
 		um cover um their deductibles
 		it helps you know pay the rent and or the mortgage and they and the car payments when uh that person has to be off with something like cancer or heart attack
 	
 	
 		oh you bet
 		supplemental anything is important today i'll tell you whether
 	
 	
 		exactly and i'm i real feel real fortunate that i've landed in a with a really good company in a good position
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		and they're really nice too one of the benefits of that company is that they provide me with some stock
 		um they give it to me uh three point five percent of what i sell
 		and um uh annualized premium and so this is really going to add up through the years i've been doing this over a year and have already accumulated quite a bit
 	
 	
 		well that's super
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 	
 	
 		we're just uh
 		i carry my own Keogh Plan as far as benefits and i've been doing that since nineteen seventy four or seventy five or whatever and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's more or less my wife's and my retirement i'm fifty years old my wife is forty nine and she didn't start teaching till she was forty so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we raised our kids first and she went back and got her degree and started teaching so it looks like
 		we're gonna retire in a couple of years and she'll uh she'll qualify for a little something after ten years of teaching but not a whole lot but it'll be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		certainly be useful and needed
 	
 	
 		right what kind of business are you in
 	
 	
 		i'm in the sporting goods business i'm a own a manufacturer's rep firm and uh we we represent eighteen different hunting and shooting type companies and that's all i've done since
 	
 	
 		i see
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i graduated school years ago sold a sold
 	
 	
 		is that right well it's the first time i've been in sales in my life uh-huh
 	
 	
 		really oh it's neat isn't it
 	
 	
 		i love it i love it i should've been there a long time ago
 	
 	
 		oh yes
