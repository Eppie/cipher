 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh what topic would you like to discuss political topic
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know i guess the thing that's on my mind lately is these hostages that have been released  so i can't imagine how it would've been to been incarcerated incarcerated for that length of time
 	
 	
 		well i think it's marvelous they finally figured a way to get them out of there huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm not sure what it ever  what it really accomplished having them uh locked up for that long did the uh did their captors ever really say this is why we're holding them and
 	
 	
 		well what they wanted of course was uh one money and two the release of all the Palestinians held by the
 		Israels
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know the the the Jewish folks and uh i guess they're gonna get a lot of those released and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		i understand there's uh what several hundred or even thousands of political prisoners
 	
 	
 		probably a lot i probably a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah  what's uh what's been pressing you lately
 	
 	
 		well i think the developments in Soviet Union are rather interesting
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not real sure how they're gonna all turn out i hope they turn out positively and not turn into chaos but
 	
 	
 		well does it sound like Gorbachev definitely out of a job to you
 		
 
 	
 	
 		certainly sounds that way doesn't it
 	
 	
 		looks looks that way uh i'm a little disappointed and i and i think people uh
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		well he's won a peace prize and uh
 	
 	
 		well i think that's one of the
 		problems being a Mister Nice Guy and i think that's what he was and is you know i i think he tried to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		accommodate  too many people uh and in a structure like that apparently it's a difficult if not impossible task i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but Europe is
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and whether we like it or not when
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the USSR was together the peace was kept in Europe relatively speaking
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh there might be a big void there and i uh it's certainly a
 	
 	
 		well
 		
 
 	
 	
 		fence sitting situation i i i hope it's not a
 		i hope it gets resolved properly let's put that way
 	
 	
 		yeah  well it's gonna be interesting see what happens the next year there
 	
 	
 		with all those nuclear weapons floating around you get uh
 		get the wrong person there i think we could have major problems
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		i i don't necessarily mean we in in the US alone but the world
 	
 	
 		i'm curious what uh what Texans think of their neighboring state and uh recent uh gubernatorial race there with uh David Duke
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how was the what was the press like in in Texas over that issue
 	
 	
 		well of course there's a number of rednecks in Texas that i'm sure would jump on his band wagon and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i'm sure the vast vast majority would
 		think it of him as he probably is
 	
 	
 		um-hum i it's remarkable that he can uh i think that he can get this far as he's gotten  with uh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		you know the kind of background he's got and i'm i'm just surprised that he has uh
 		seems like that'd be something that be so controversial that it pretty well exclude himself from any political office
 	
 	
 		well i think the South is not the nation
 		certainly still has many racist type people that uh would jump on his band wagon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		being a springer splinter operation i'm sure it wouldn't you know it it raises a lot of noise and everything but i don't think it would probably go very far in a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		overall scope of things
 	
 	
 		well i think we're a little isolated where i live here we just don't have many uh
 		many blacks to speak of uh you know probably less than five percent of the population i would guess
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		we have a fair  a fair amount of uh
 		Hispanics and um
 		Native Americans
 		not too many blacks
 	
 	
 		well well i think it's a i grew up in uh Milwaukee and Wisconsin and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think uh you know it's definitely a different philosophy of how you look at blacks up North as you do in the South
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know it i growing up uh
 		where i grew up in our high school you had one black that was from out of the area to start with and you know we had three thousand kids in our high school so
 	
 	
 		that was the extent of it huh
 	
 	
 		we weren't really you know even you know when we played football against a couple black teams and you know that part of Milwaukee uh
 		you know they were nothing you know i mean now now it's all the blacks in football and basketball
 	
 	
 		i'll say there's they sure dominate the pro sports don't they and well and collegiate too so
 	
 	
 		so i
 		i don't i don't know what uh you know times have changed but
 		i i think that's one of the reasons the Packers will always have problems having a
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		getting back to the status they were during the Lombardi years and uh Green Bay being an extremely small town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of sixty thousand fifty five thousand
