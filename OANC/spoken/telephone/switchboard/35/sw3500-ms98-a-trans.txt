 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in in light the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot
 		i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem
 	
 	
 		do you why
 	
 	
 		why well if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to so they could become doctors the problem would go away
 	
 	
 		you think the problem is not enough doctors
 	
 	
 		i think the problem is that the doctor  doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors
 		and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor you are going to pay high premiums on your health uh unemployment i mean on your liability
 	
 	
 		gosh i really have a different point of view on this  well because i'm a nurse for one thing
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		and you think there are plenty of doctors
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i don't think there is a shortage of doctors and i do know that OB which is my field the doctors' health insurance the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it's astronomical
 	
 	
 		that deliver babies now they can't doing anything about that i don't think they're in a conspiracy i think it's our fault because we as people just sue them
 	
 	
 		no people don't sue
 	
 	
 		people are very sue sue conscious
 	
 	
 		lawyers sue if you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they wouldn't sue a one of them
 	
 	
 		well that's probably true too
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		but people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days
 	
 	
 		well sure but you know when you think about reasonableness now i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the the tort theory you know what tort theory is
 	
 	
 		and so
 		no
 	
 	
 		well a tort is when you do something wrong
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well it uh an OBGYN doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		if the baby is born dead well that happens if if they have complications and
 	
 	
 		well
 		it depends
 	
 	
 		well i know i mean there are guys that are real slobs but you know there are also people out there that are really doing their job
 		and the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else
 	
 	
 		well that's true they are because doctors are performing many more tests many of them are unnecessary they are doing so many C sections
 	
 	
 		you know
 		
 
 		just to prevent a a law suit
 	
 	
 		just to prevent because they have all these monitors now and if anything looks even a little bit funny
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby and so it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests for surgery for longer hospital stay so it's terrible
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		see i believe that there there is a system already in place
 		for health care
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know they have indigent health care you show up at Parkland bleeding and they'll fix you
 	
 	
 		you'll get it that's true
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		in fact you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there too and we have that happen we have patients that go through Parkland through the clinic and at the last minute they come to us well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh we can't turn them away
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation
 		the problem would pretty much evaporate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'm for that i've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer so i'd like to wipe them all out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i i happen to know a few and i even claim one as a friend
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he's a divorce attorney
 	
 	
 		he better not be mine
 	
 	
 		but
 		
 
 		i think he'll go nameless for the for the purposes of this conversation but i also know an uh OBGYN who has stopped practicing
 	
 	
 		yeah some they do
 	
 	
 		uh he just said
 	
 	
 		they stop their OB at least
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean he's not going to deliver any more babies ever his malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year
 	
 	
 		right right
 		that's incredible
 	
 	
 		and you know he said i had to he had to earn gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice
 	
 	
 		yeah and most of them are very sincere most of them do the best they can they are human occasionally
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 		this this guy is Catholic
 	
 	
 		something will go wrong
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean you know
 	
 	
 		well you can be human and Catholic
 	
 	
 		yeah i know you can be human and Catholic but you're not likely to find somebody who is going to you know have a less conscientious effort i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah no most of them do i really believe that from dealing with doctors dealing with lawyers there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious
 		but
 	
 	
 		well you know who is getting rich
 		insurance companies
 	
 	
 		yeah they are
 	
 	
 		you know if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would
 		negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance
 		say say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed or
