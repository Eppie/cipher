 
     		
 	
 		well my view i work for a financial institution and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		yeah and i love my credit card uh you end up with more consumer rights by using credit cards than
 	
 	
 		what do you mean by that
 	
 	
 		uh what i mean is say you pay for something with a check your check clears you're out the bucks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you pay for something with a credit card you dissatisfied are dissatisfied with it you take it back and they say sorry we you can't take it back if you know you can leave it there and then just have your Visa charged back
 	
 	
 		oh what's your favorite credit card do you use Visa how come
 	
 	
 		get your money back
 		Visa
 		well that's the kind we offer
 	
 	
 		oh that's a good reason that's a good reason
 	
 	
 		and uh we're just offering a a new card that gives you one up to one percent back of all the charges that you make
 	
 	
 		now
 	
 	
 		cash back you know like Discover's
 	
 	
 		i was gonna say i know Discover does that
 	
 	
 		yep and we're starting to do that
 	
 	
 		Visa's gonna do it too
 	
 	
 		we are
 	
 	
 		who all right who puts out your Visa card
 	
 	
 		uh we do  America First Credit Union
 	
 	
 		who is we
 		America First Credit Union and you're gonna offer the cash back just like Discover does huh well i i'll tell you that works because i use my Discover card more than any other credit card for that sole reason
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		did you get much back
 	
 	
 		hm  yeah  unfortunately i use my Discover card more than i ought to not a great deal i get i get about a check for about fifty some bucks at the end of the year usually
 	
 	
 		well good for you that must mean
 		and it's one percent so you spend about five thousand
 	
 	
 		i shouldn't tell that to you
 	
 	
 		that's pretty good
 		well i i do better than that everything goes on mine and then i've got a business too that i use it for charging computers on
 	
 	
 		well i tell you then then i have an exact account of everything i've bought it's all printed out
 	
 	
 		it is nice
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and as long as you keep your statements then you know exactly what you've spent and if you know when you bought something because often i won't remember
 		and i can go back you know i'll remember the month so i can go back to my my credit card invoice and there it is it tells me the exact date and everything
 	
 	
 		well how many cards have you got
 	
 	
 		well i have a whole slew of the them but i really i use i have a Visa um but my Visa is an automatic draw from my credit from my
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh a debit card yes i don't like those
 	
 	
 		yeah and so i don't either because it's gone although they don't debit it until the end of the month yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really that's interesting
 	
 	
 		um but it still automatically comes off that month if i time it right then any like  my
 		my date is the twelfth so if i charge something on the thirteenth then i don't get that bill till the end of the month and it's not due till before the twelfth of the next month so i can put off paying for something for free for two months
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		with a debit card
 	
 	
 		no not with a debit card with my Discover card i can and and i use Discover more than any other because of the cash back
 	
 	
 		oh credit
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i have MasterCard and then i have all the different department stores but i just really never use them and i try desperately hard to pay it off each month
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		because the the cost to use it is terrific
 	
 	
 		
 
 		is it twenty percent interest
 	
 	
 		uh it varies from eighteen and a half to twenty one percent
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and that's that's tremendous amount
 	
 	
 		our card's thirteen and a half
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding me
 	
 	
 		uh with a ten dollar annual fee
 	
 	
 		how do you get one of yours
 	
 	
 		well you have to be a member of our credit union
 	
 	
 		and what credit union is that
 	
 	
 		America First
 		it's we're the
 	
 	
 		oh but see you're in Utah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and you'd have to be a resident of the state
 	
 	
 		oh okay i was thinking about your brother he said Jack and he'll do that but that's you're nowhere near us wow  that's a neat idea though perhaps some other people around here will catch on and do it too
 	
 	
 		uh do you have Mervyn's and all those have you noticed that they all have started issuing their own credit cards
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah they have for years but you can still use the three big ones MasterCard Visa and now Discover you can still use those three um at almost any department store
 	
 	
 		what do you think of Discover uh Sears not taking anyone but theirs
 	
 	
 		they have not done that for years
 	
 	
 		yeah do you like that or do you think that's fair or
 	
 	
 		i don't know i used when i was a a kid  i worked for Sears
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it i'm just  i'm so used to them not taking anybody but theirs they'll take Discover but see they back Discover too so it doesn't bother me because i use Discover most of the time
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's theirs
 		ah okay
 		let's see
 		do you think that uh the move towards plastic is a good thing
 	
 	
 		i think i
