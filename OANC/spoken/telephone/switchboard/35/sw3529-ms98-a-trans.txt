 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i asked you first because i couldn't think of which one i've seen
 	
 	
 		well let me see
 		uh i guess the last one we saw at the movie was probably Pretty Woman
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw that uh-huh it was cute
 	
 	
 		did you
 		oh i thought it was too i thought it was a real good movie um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the last one that i saw i i was thinking about whenever the  the voice was uh telling us what to think about i rented last weekend this movie called a The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie
 		that was made in nineteen nineteen sixty nine starred Maggie Smith  who's really one of my all time favorite actresses i don't know if you're if you're familiar familiar with her
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		oh i've
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but she's English and she won the Academy Award for it that year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh
 	
 	
 		and um i had just seen it but it was just a fluke that i happened to see it i was in college back then and i  and and happened to see it and it and i remember thinking thinking at the time when i was watching it i was going gosh this is you know
 		even that at that young i said it this is an Academy Award performance it has to be you you know and as it turned out she did win it that year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's great i remember that movie and i remember that it was very good i don't remember if i saw it or not
 	
 	
 		yeah but but i rented it uh last weekend and i can't i  i don't know when i've enjoyed a movie um as much as i did that one it was just excellent so um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		uh there's one that um oh let's see my son likes with Tom Cruise it's a an airplane movie uh
 	
 	
 		Top Gun um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		Top Gun yes i thought that was a good movie
 	
 	
 		lots of rock them sock them action in that yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah there's a lot of action but i thought it was an excellent movie
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it was good
 	
 	
 		and let's see
 	
 	
 		do you like any of the old have you seen uh  friend of mine that who is in Denver was telling me about uh all these old movies from the thirties and forties
 	
 	
 		oh well now i love all those
 	
 	
 		well she told me about one that uh and i said i said gosh i don't think i've seen any of that and she said well rent this one she told me  it's called Now Voyager with Betty Davis great it was terrific
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		oh well that's good um i remember that movie i don't remember if i saw it i saw everything i could see when i was younger  and i remember a lot of them and i love seeing them again
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i don't think anything will ever top Gone with the Wind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you know it was on television here in Houston oh about two weeks ago
 	
 	
 		yeah we taped it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		did you yeah it it it really is it's such a classic yeah
 	
 	
 		it really is anything course with Clark Gable i like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh   oh i don't know let's i like the older movies because they were just so much more classier than what you see today
 	
 	
 		well they really were and i i don't know that it just seems that you know there was so much more thought that went in behind them and the the dialogue was good it wasn't uh uh i mean
 		you know i'm i'll be honest with you it takes a fair amount to offend me  and sometimes i go to these movies and they've got just this gratuitous uh uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know cursing in there just and and it seems like you know it and they somebody says well we need to have the you know x number of of dirty words in in order to make it appealing and and and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's  i'm always impressed with a with a good movie that that can get by without it i saw tell you what i saw  know and this that reminds me of it is City Slickers which was um was real cute
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but anyway the thing that reminded me about it was real clean
 	
 	
 		yeah well they could leave out a lot of that stuff and the movie would be just as good
 	
 	
 		i agree i agree
 	
 	
 		now um let's see i saw that Dances with Wolves  it was good yes
 	
 	
 		that was good wasn't it
 		i didn't think it was just the end all and be all like the Academy thought the you know
 	
 	
 		no i didn't think so and i told everybody that if i had made that movie i could have made it shorter  because there wasn't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		any need to go into that much detail
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know show me one thing and i get the picture no right but it had a good story and uh and it was a little different but it was a little too gross for me
 	
 	
 		yeah not over and over and over and over
 		uh-huh
 		well you know that's it my my mother i whenever she and my my dad went to see it and i asked them uh uh how they liked it and then my mother said well if you like a lot of gore and blood it's great and  you know and i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		i'm partially immune to it but it didn't  excuse me it didn't seem to be
