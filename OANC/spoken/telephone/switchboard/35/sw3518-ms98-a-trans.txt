 		hi how you doing Kevin
 	
 	
 		
 
 		fine thanks
 	
 	
 		good good glad to hear that i understand are
 	
 	
 		
 
 		are you a total banner
 	
 	
 		total banner no i i believe that uh the American public and i as an individual and private citizen have a right to to bear arms and to have a gun as long as i uh am responsible with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and protect the safety and welfare of my kids and
 		and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it i think that education with a gun is is critical and important
 		um however i do believe that uh guns ought to be maintained and and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people
 		that are angry or have concerns or want to get seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns and in the heat of the moment they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people so
 		on a scale of one to ten i i think i would rate myself as a in the six or seven or eight
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		but i think that there ought to be some control but i still think that uh individuals have a right how do you feel about it
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well so let me make sure so so you think that uh maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate
 	
 	
 		well i don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate uh that uh
 		that might cool down some tempers i think a a one day would be sufficient the reason i say that is there's an awful lot of people who go to gun shows
 		and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun if that five day waiting period were in effect that you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show
 	
 	
 		uh you just you'd be able to buy it but they'd just have to mail it to you i suppose huh
 	
 	
 		well i don't think you can mail thing guns through the mail i don't know  i think that's a against the law ever since Kennedy was
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		well
 		
 
 	
 	
 		assassinated so how do you feel about guns
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		let's see i think that gun control has come up because there's been some crazies that killed people with guns
 		and i think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault whether you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well do you think that there will continue to always be crazies
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		then uh
 		how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns
 	
 	
 		well we have some laws on the books that uh don't allow convicted felons to purchase guns if i understand correctly and
 		uh i would agree a a short waiting period would be appropriate to uh take care of the heat of the moment type things but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i think banning semiautomatic twenty two rifles is a a bit on the extreme side
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway
 	
 	
 		okay do you uh do you feel that there is a need in the world today to have a an automatic handgun
 	
 	
 		the only purpose for handguns is to shoot people
 		in my opinion or or you could do it just for fun you know kind of like a game but uh
 	
 	
 		well i think that the the police uh or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves but the public i don't know
 	
 	
 		i think that i should have a right to own a handgun not a automatic semiautomatic
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah not an Uzi
 	
 	
 		no no uh but i think a person needs a way of defending themselves
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you saw Indiana Jones the guy came after him with that big knife
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and just he took care of him just one shot
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yes that's true and he uh saved himself in the in the in the process also
 	
 	
 		that's right so how's work going
 	
 	
 		very fine very very
 	
 	
 		they don't let you take guns to work do they
 	
 	
 		no they that's uh that's prohibited where we work although down here in Texas uh you do have a right to to wear and carry arms with you at all times
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's still uh that's still you can still do that down here
 	
 	
 		can they be
 		is it concealed or does it have to
 	
 	
 		oh you can't no it it should not be concealed
 	
 	
 		has to be on the hip
 	
 	
 		it has to be on the hip  has to be in sight so that uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah that you're not uh a menace or
 		a problem to individuals how about where you live there in Utah
 	
 	
 		can a
