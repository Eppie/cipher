 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		about the weather  uh
 	
 	
 		oh yes uh very appropriate i guess
 		uh you ready for this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay John just a moment
 		
 
 		well guess what we get to talk about the weather  uh
 	
 	
 		the weather is uh this time of year has actually been kind of unusual i've expected it to be colder until you know what we've gotten last couple days
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i fly for a living and i've uh the weather's been terribly unusual every where i've been
 	
 	
 		oh you do so you you you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather and imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 		that way it was around here last night i'll tell you that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well actually i'm i've i've heard on the news that we uh will be setting a  record here in the state of Texas for the uh large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year
 		that it's gonna break all kind of records that were set set set back since nineteen thirty two
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		so yeah  if it uh keeps on raining like this and i understand it's supposed to rain until Saturday night
 	
 	
 		hm
 		Saturday or Sunday they were saying yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yes so we're gonna
 	
 	
 		yeah i know the systems have been real strong out i went through uh Phoenix on twice on uh Wednesday morning
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh shot approaches to low minimum it was both both times you know and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather
 	
 	
 		wow
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well so are you an airline pilot
 	
 	
 		yes i am with Southwest yeah yep
 	
 	
 		oh great
 		with Southwest fantastic i have a brother i have a brother that's a pilot also with American
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yes and so i imagine you uh
 		oh with all this kind of weather it's uh makes it kind of dangerous for you
 	
 	
 		well now i no i wouldn't call it danger this is uh this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in this is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the springtime
 	
 	
 		oh i guess so yeah
 	
 	
 		you know the the the air systems are reasonably calm you don't have uh the turbulence you know you little bit of chop but it's not like it is in the spring time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yes well we moved actually down here from another location and it's spectacular the the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 		spectacular is the right word for them
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		spectacular is a good word for them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've never seen a thunder show like i've seen down here before in in Texas
 	
 	
 		it's amazing
 	
 	
 		lights up the whole sky and even on a on a actually i've i've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky it's a cloudless night
 		and the rain isn't falling but you can see the thunder and lightning excuse me see the lightning going horizontally across the sky and and back and forth and what a light show it's it's fabulous
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 		yeah cloud to cloud it can be real really sensational here
 	
 	
 		yes yes that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah really where you from originally
 	
 	
 		i'm from uh northern Utah and that's a very arid climate from uh Salt Lake City area
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there's always a lot of snow in fact where i grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to uh twelve different major ski resorts
 		and so there was an awful lot of snow and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		which made it fantastic for skiing and
 		and sleigh riding and everything else so we had a great time and
 	
 	
 		oh oh yeah yeah
 		were you near Park they were near the Park Cities area
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's beautiful area
 	
 	
 		in a
 		in Snowbird and Solitude and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and Brighton and yes all those areas so i imagine have you skied before
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we've skied i have not skied that area i've driven through it several times uh i've skied we skied California a bunch when we lived out there and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh um and of course grew we grew up in Minnesota and we do some skiing there
 	
 	
 		oh yes oh yes
 	
 	
 		lot of cross country skiing there
 	
 	
 		yeah great well do you think this the the weather is typical for this time of the year
 	
 	
 		well not really i you know Minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow um the uh the um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh we've getting a fair amount of rain for this time of year already i i think and uh i've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today you know that moved in last night
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 		yeah it's been it's been cold there was a time though in the uh middle part of November that got really cool really really unseasonably cool
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes it did
 	
 	
 		and then it warmed right back up and i thought great  and that's
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's a fun thing yeah uh my wife was just listening here and she said yeah it froze in fact
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it was real cold that was that was very unseasonable for us down here
 	
 	
 		and uh but uh i've really enjoyed the weather down here too because uh two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather weather
 		and it's not as severe i should say as the weather that i've experienced up in northern Utah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah that's that's real true same with us from Minnesota it's it's uh in fact i've i played golf on the first on the New Year's Day one year
 	
 	
 		down here
 	
 	
 		you know it was yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		not in Minnesota
 	
 	
 		no no no no
 	
 	
 		i have a brother-in-law that lives in Minnesota and they say boy six months out of the year it's bitter cold and
 	
 	
 		oh it is it is
 	
 	
 		and the wind and the blowing snow and everything it's
 	
 	
 		well and they've had uh you know usually in Minnesota they get their snow in January and uh February
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're up over sixty five or sixty
