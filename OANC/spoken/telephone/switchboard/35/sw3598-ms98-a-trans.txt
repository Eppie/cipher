 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well do you like to sail
 	
 	
 		i used to sail quite a bit when i was younger and i haven't sailed much recently but i do like it i do like it how about yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that
 		oh i love to sail i have a i was first introduced to it when i was in Atlanta
 		oh gosh in the late seventies i had a neighbor who had a little seventeen foot day sailor that we used to go out on Lake Lanier north of Atlanta just about every weekend in the summertime
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it was just more fun than a barrel of monkeys
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and just loved it and then uh i i don't know it i had never sailed before and i took to it like the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		how old were you at that time
 	
 	
 		um that was um twenty five or so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then i was transferred to Houston
 		and as luck would have it uh one of my cohorts at work uh was partner uh with another guy who had a forty two foot uh Tarten as a matter of fact he still has it and so i got to go sailing a lot uh
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		on that we've been down to Corpus and over to um i've been on the Pensacola yacht race and just in a whole little bit of gulf sailing and uh it's spectacular um i just it's one of my favorite very favorite things to do
 	
 	
 		what's it like sailing on the gulf in um Corpus
 	
 	
 		well once you get out
 	
 	
 		is it pretty rough
 	
 	
 		well now sure i've been  whenever it was just horrendous i mean when we went out in storms and then again i've been out there whenever it's just almost
 		you know just real light light waves i mean it's it's varied from one extreme to the other but whenever you get out away from the shoreline out in the blue water and the you know the dolphin start swimming along beside the boat and it uh it's wonderful
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		that's something
 	
 	
 		and of course that's the best of all possible worlds because i don't have to pay upkeep on it or any
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because honey you know that that there's a saying what's a sailboat it's a hole in the water that you throw money into
 	
 	
 		i've never heard that one i suppose that's probably true so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh the guy the guy my friend who owns the boat that's what he professes that he said yeah then he said
 	
 	
 		forty two foot boat is probably quite a investment
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 		yeah it really is and uh he also says uh uh sailing is is uh a way to go uh nowhere fast to go to go nowhere at very slow speeds at very great expense
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but then you know there's something so much more magical about sailing as opposed to other kinds of boating i feel like
 		um
 		i don't know if it's a matter of the speed or if it's just the fact that you have a little bit more control
 		at the tiller than you do say if you're in a power boat
 	
 	
 		well oh yeah and i agree with you a hundred percent i mean i have after having sailed a little bit i just have no interest at all in a power boat and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		almost seems like it would be slightly boring
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's just you know the whole idea of getting out there and uh making  you know fine tuning the sails and trimming and and adjusting just to to eke out a little more speed from the wind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		and uh just have and i don't know just the whole you you you well and you're closer to nature too than having a big throbbing engine behind you
 	
 	
 		more of a challenge
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i i really do love it i've got uh um my company uh has some a facility in Aruba and i'm going down there in uh this spring and i hope to get a chance to do a little sailing down there
 	
 	
 		beautiful clear water down there i'm sure
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		so one of the things i think i may even try is uh uh you know the the little sail board with the what they call it
 	
 	
 		oh where you're standing like a surf board only there's a
 	
 	
 		wind sailing yeah whatever but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't you know i'm not quite sure if i'm ready to try that or not i
 	
 	
 		i almost tried that once with a on a Club Med vacation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um they had these other flat they weren't flat actually they were
 		um probably eight to ten foot little skiffs that were a lot more fun  so i went where my experience was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah and i i have heard people talk that that uh you know you almost have to have lessons and then it's really you know not easy to master those uh those
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it looks challenging physically challenging
 	
 	
 		it really it really does but again it looks like something that looks how it maybe like roller skating would be it looks like a lot of fun but not that easy to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh have you ever surfed
 	
 	
 		no i never have
 	
 	
 		that might be the same sort of muscles that you'd use but
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		or skied  those are also if your muscles are developed there then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it wouldn't be as difficult as it might be for some other people
 	
 	
 		yeah right right but uh anyway that's uh sort of the the extent of my water sports but i i do i find sailing just to be uh one of the best ways for me to get out and relax and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		have you ever considered uh either buying in with someone else a partnership in a boat or
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i have considered it and at the same time it's um
 		where i live in Houston it's in order to to really get the use out of it i would need to move down near Clear Clear Lake closer to the water
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and uh that would mean commuting up the Gulf Freeway every morning into downtown and and i'm i live so close to the office that i'm just not
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know the idea of having to commute on a freeway in Houston every day even as much as i would like to have access to a boat you know more often than i do yeah it's it's just not that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's a trade off certainly
