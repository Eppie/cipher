 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i tell you what uh my my uh notion of camping is uh
 		uh well i haven't been very far out see i've been in the uh hill country that's about as far as i've gone as far as camping so i haven't done any really really rough rugged camping
 		but uh yeah to me it's the uh pitching a tent and i mean we we're talking real roughing it no cabin no johns nothing just being out there in the woods yeah that's it exactly no uh i don't
 	
 	
 		
 
 		Boy Scout huh yeah do you do you backpack car camp
 	
 	
 		no actually the only camping i ever did was was when i was a scout and uh as much as i would like to you know to do it i
 		you know don't really have the time right now but i've got two young boys and i'm waiting for them to get a little bit older then we'll start doing some camping
 	
 	
 		my son's twelve and he's in the Boy Scout and he went on his first backpack five miles i've gone with him on uh some other things where we
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		we kind of called it car camping where the car is you know a hundred feet away or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i did not go on the backpack i'm uh my back wouldn't allow me to  carry that so
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		he got the backpack in and carried the whole thing and do it the Boy Scout way and he came back tired and wore out but what i didn't my scouting was not as involved as i'd want i got the star and that was it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i'm hoping he'll go all the way his troop is very active and there's about as many dads involved as going out camping and canoeing as there are boys so
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		it's an important part are you involved in Indian Guides or Indian Princess with your children
 	
 	
 		no not yet but i'll tell you i i know i was when i was smaller i started out Indian Guides and then went into Cub Cub for a very short time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then we kind of i kind of got away from it for a while and then uh when i got back into it again i was ready for for Boy Scouts and i joined joined the Scouts
 		but i tell you i i sure uh recommend it for any any any young boy girl too i mean i i really enjoyed my time in the Scouts
 	
 	
 		does
 		we've done rent a tent in Arkansas once where it was a state park and they have very nice manicured
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well paved park and beautiful uh
 		uh bathrooms within walking distance and you rent a site and they rent a tent that's and you put your tent well one tent's already up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's not very rough at all you have electricity and running running water right there but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i think for a family outing it's good
 		uh but you know if you're with a bunch of uh preteen and and young teenagers who really want to rough it yeah i i'd recommend going the old backpack method
 	
 	
 		you mentioned the word rough my idea of rough my wife's idea of roughing it is if the town only has one Holiday Inn to choose from and she just feels like she's being imposed upon
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i kind of at my age i kind of like the car car car uh camping
 	
 	
 		yeah i can understand that
 	
 	
 		uh uh my sister and her husband uh their children are out of college by gosh they're already into this uh well car camping plus they will leave the car a few miles away
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh but they're they're they're enjoying that so uh we've gone cabin camping in Colorado
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh where there's a uh you you uh have all the conveniences but you camp in the cabin and that's not camping at all in your opinion
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i hope you find more places to go camping
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm really looking forward to it you know i i really did enjoy my experience and i i'm hoping my boys'll enjoy it as much as i did
 	
 	
 		have you checked checked into the State Park system
 	
 	
 		no not yet but i tell you i i know my wife she hasn't she really wasn't uh well her family
 		they used to go camping quite a bit when she was younger then as she got older they kind of stopped going and and she's expressed interest in going and doing some camping so
 	
 	
 		sleeping on the ground that whole bit huh
 	
 	
 		but probably yeah probably not that rough we're probably talking probably tents
 	
 	
 		screened in shelters work her up to screened in shelters that's a good place to start from in a yeah a cot and then slowly break her in i don't think my wife would even consider going to a tent camp again at all it's just
 	
 	
 		yeah with cots with with cots yeah and
 		
 
 	
 	
 		one time we did go that thing uh there we came back from an event and turned the lights on around the camp site and there's a skunk right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and without thinking i picked up a stick and threw it at it as it as it was starting to voluntarily walk away why i didn't let it but i threw a stick at it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-oh
 	
 	
 		it turned around and if a skunk give you a dirty look it did and i said i done made a mistake
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i said please skunk go on and he looked looked at me a little bit more then wandered on off very very slowly as my wife and children headed for the nearest tent to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh people we'd go down to the coast every now and then and we've noticed some people camp out on the beach on public beaches and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 		i didn't know you can do that
 	
 	
 		uh public beaches State of Texas beaches not where it's city owned property
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh not like Corpus
