 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh how you how do you find out what's going on
 	
 	
 		what's new
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well uh
 		quite a variety of ways i guess uh like to listen to the radio back and forth to work at least back to work and in the mornings
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you listen you listen to the same station or do you switch back and forth
 	
 	
 		well i have one station i listen to when i get up in the house then i listen to another one in the car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i listen to i actually i listen to the radio most of all i don't i don't buy papers and stuff i i listen a lot to national public radio
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which is i know pretty much it's got in the morning it has like an all news format
 		and then uh toward it it changes like it goes onto classical then onto jazz later on but on in the way to work that that's what i do is i listen to to NPR and what it says about about what's going on
 	
 	
 		hum
 		well we don't have uh well let's see i guess it might be available i just haven't heard of it on that one i i guess i have come to think of it but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i haven't made a practice of listening to that one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		watching some TV in the evenings
 	
 	
 		uh what  it's it's funny i haven't seen do you watch like CNN or do you uh or the
 	
 	
 		well i usually catch the networks and i will occasionally watch CNN too depends on what you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		Jack do you listen i don't know do i i like it when i watch TV i don't really watch TV news all that often but what i do is i i like ABC i think i think they have the best news network
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		i generally uh i don't know i go to the NBC sometimes
 	
 	
 		have
 	
 	
 		ABC sometimes
 	
 	
 		have you ever watched Nightline with with with Ted Coppell or is that i i i get to see that i get that occasionally but it's like i i he's a i think he's sort of like an upscale Geraldo
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i watch that
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know he i digs he he digs just a digs just like a a a little a little too much i i wish i could actually stay up late enough to to see some of the to see some of those things
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you get Time Magazine or Newsweek or anything like that
 	
 	
 		uh i don't take them i read them sometime i read them in the barber shop or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		dentist office material
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i actually i i kind of gave up on on news magazines they they haven't they kind of pile end up piling up
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i was just about to say about the newspaper i uh i take it then i quit it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah it
 	
 	
 		gets there laying around and don't get to read it's does get to be quite a volume of
 	
 	
 		oh well i tried like uh i like i read the Sunday paper you know i that one i can probably i can find time for you know like on a i i really like to on a Sunday morning get up and uh listen uh get up
 	
 	
 		material after awhile
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and read the Sunday paper like first usually i try to read it from like from cover to cover you know
 	
 	
 		yeah that same here
 	
 	
 		and that that pretty much gives you gives me an idea what's going on and in about like a two hours it takes me to run right through it i can figure out exactly what what what's happened in like the past week
 		but that's about the only newspaper that i really listen to
 	
 	
 		our our morning paper throws you a curve they uh you know that's what i would like to do i say well i'd just like to take the Sunday paper well
 		we'll uh we'll let you have the rest of the week for free
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 		what do you what do you do
 	
 	
 		so you end well you end up with like a big stack of papers anyway on the on the way out huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		but i say well the heck with it we'll go buy it from that guy on the street
 	
 	
 		well one of the things that i i can't do is i just can't find the time to read the paper all that much it just
 		if i were to if i were to it would take like what half hour a day
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		to to to find the time to read the paper
 		and that's why i like the radio the best especially especially in the car because i when i'm in the car and i'm on my way to work there's nothing else i can do other than like watch the road you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've gotten into some uh
 		you know we have a uh
 		news service on our uh
 		network here on the computer
 	
 	
 		oh and it its it slides in a window across the bottom
 	
 	
 		well we have that at at lunch in the cafeteria but we also have uh one that you pull up on your screen you know we have a computer network here at TI that you can go to uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so do you is it is it Dow Jones
 	
 	
 		Dallas and get the national
 		they have a Dow Jones segment there where it covers us uh you know some most active stocks uh general average
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		friends of mine at friends of mine at other at other uh at other locations they have they have that and it's like you can actually see like the ticker run you know you can open a window on your work station
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and you can run and you can run the uh the ticker across the bottom and it it actually you know they they run a ticker for for news items as well as stock
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's actual that DJNS i guess
 	
 	
 		and so you can see you can see the uh you can
