 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so um i pretty much read the paper
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yeah read i catch the news sometimes uh but we're so busy usually i just grab the paper at work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh we we and we get the really local papers here so can find out what the school board's doing and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh i don't watch i don't watch any TV really um and i i don't subscribe to the paper but a lot of the people who i work with do and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i i like grab the paper like to see how my stock is doing and things like that because i don't always call my broker and things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but actually now that i think of it the thing the place where i get most of my information is i have an hour commute in the morning and in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh so we listen to NPR a lot and we hear we listen to Morning Edition in the morning and Fresh Air and All Things Considered in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh and even if we're not listening to the feature stories we certainly tune in at the top of the hour because you got about six minutes of good news and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i guess i get most of mine um just from word of mouth just people chatting at work and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah i i'd like to get you know things little straight a little more from the horse's mouth although i dislike the way that the media for instance distorting the the campaigns like oh big surprise Clinton won in the South you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know this must mean he's the frontrunner now why because you know all of his region votes on one day
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 		but you know i i find especially NPR is fairly unbiased you know i use to watch CNN a lot when i got cable
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because uh they also seem to not lean one way or the other in their reporting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh our local papers like the Boston Globe you know where you we have you know you've got the Boston Globe which is extreme in one way and the Manchester Union Leader which like supports Buchanan and things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so between the two of them you know it's not a lot of and then you've got the Boston Phoenix Weekly with the nine hundred ads in the back you know but other than that there just isn't a lot of you know unbiased local print reporting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		right yeah the the the constitution is is pretty bad too and and they it it just seems like they spend a lot too much time on trivialities and things you know they they emphasize the wrong things especially in the campaign
 	
 	
 		yeah and and i i don't even bother with local news because it's it's like you know um i'm a pilot so i'm aware of how how they misrepresent you know it's like a guy would do a gears up landing and it'd be there was a crash landing today and our camera crew was there
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know they they or and then of course on sweeps it's how you can get cancer from eating common foods but we're not going to tell you during the thirty second spot you know tune in for a twenty seven part report over the next three weeks
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 		i really think that um
 		you know you have to go to some uh place like NPR that doesn't have a vested interest in you know they don't really care about you know getting two hundred thousand people to watch their shows because they're funded by people who do want to hear this kind of news
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and the other nice thing about my local uh NPR station is they also got monitor radio and the BBC
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		through yeah they do  this this is basically our all news AM station 10A
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so what you get is you get uh they they've kind of picked up so you get like five AM they give BBC then you've got  uh you've got Morning Edition from like six till nine then they pick up again with the BBC
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then in the afternoon you get uh the NPR's talk show and then you've got uh Fresh Air at four All Things Considered till seven then you get Market Place then they give you BBC again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		what
 	
 	
 		so it's really you know for they they've got a bunch of classical music in the afternoon but other than that it's just straight news reporting from about four different sources
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		and you know it's kind of neat to see how the BBC reports things differently you know they they've got a much different view like reporting South Africa and the Middle East
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i find that NPR and the BBC has a much more global view than like ABC or one of the US ones
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		but you know because you know i find that um a the the American uh electronic media is so uh ethnocentric
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where
 		you know they they they don't realize for instance that there's a recession happening in the rest of the world too it's not not just us lucky people
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 		so you know that's pretty much where i get my information from uh and you know i'll i'll glance through the Boston Globe to get the local news there and i'll glance through the uh like the Milford Cabinet uh the National Telegraph to get the really local news
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah it's like the Globe gives you like regional news uh and Boston news
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like my fiance is telling me the Globe sucks uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and then you get like uh you know the uh the Telegraph and the Cabinet is giving you like how your high school football team did and what's being voted on and you know we got our picture in the Telegraph in the in the Cabinet because we went to the school board meeting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you know that that's the kind of level of stuff you get there so you get a real diversity of coverage
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
