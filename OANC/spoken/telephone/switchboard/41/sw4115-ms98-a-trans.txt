 
     		
 	
 		it sounds like you feel like taxes are probably too high
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think there's a big waste of our tax dollar
 	
 	
 		it does seem that way i was trying to think of whether we pay more tax now than we did ten or twenty years ago but it doesn't seem like we get as much out value for the tax dollar
 	
 	
 		we don't uh we it there's there's too much um
 		uh
 		pocket stuffing uh going on as far as different companies contracting to do things for the county and
 		do uh projects for the state and you know course they they prove that all the time on over the TV
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah it does seem like the special interest groups are what what keeps taxes high
 	
 	
 		but i
 		right that uh i just i just pay you know more taxes than than i can imagine if i could get i've got a little piece of property
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i just i mean when i tell you little piece of property i mean i've got five and a half acres it's out in the country
 		and if i could get what they're charging me for taxes on that i would sell it in a minute
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		you know so that that's why i just don't uh
 		there's a lot of you know a lot of expense
 		as far as our taxes and all the all the hidden costs that they spend our money on that that they shouldn't be spending our money on
 		but uh
 		i i'm i'm very uh i'm a single parent so i'm very touchy about taking every damn dime i make
 	
 	
 		yeah that does make it difficult
 	
 	
 		it does
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		really does are you you are you accountant an accountant or
 	
 	
 		uh well i used to work in finance but i i don't any longer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i was also trying to think of whether our tax rates are high compared to other countries i seem to recall that uh many many other countries have higher tax rates than ours
 		but they may also get better value for the dollar that's the real question
 	
 	
 		right well you know i've i can handle the i can handle the tax money the amount of taxes that i pay i can handle that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it
 		you know when you hit all the uh bad roads and uh
 		and you hear of all the misuse of the money and that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's a that's a bigger
 	
 	
 		right that's what's irritating
 	
 	
 		problem to me than than having to pay them
 	
 	
 		It's also irritating that
 		you we keep hearing a lot of lip service about how  how to make it better and how to spend it more wisely but they never to seem hear that that it changes or improves
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i think i think one of our uh and this is really not the total uh thing uh not totally on taxes but one of our things is our on our uh the our
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Federal Government is our uh why in the world they don't get rid of
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		one of the houses either get rid of the senate or get rid of the Congress you know get rid of one of those housing systems and uh because that's costing that's costing the taxpayer multimillions multimillions
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh but they govern each other and they they vote their selves in to staying in where they are you know and um
 		i don't i've never understood uh you know why i there is one state what state is in the United States that only has one housing i meant one governing body
 	
 	
 		um
 		i don't remember hearing that
 	
 	
 		okay there is there's one state i've i in fact i don't know whether it's New Hampshire it's a northern state
 		um
 		or New England state that has one housing body and uh one governing body and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know they their taxes are are
 		more well spent
 		but uh no i've you know i disagree with a lot of things but um a lot of things i can't change
 		but uh
 		what state what part of the country are you from
 	
 	
 		i'm from Texas but now i live in California
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm course i'm
 		i'm from Texas too but i i'm think my the two counties that i pay taxes in are two of the highest tax rate counties there are anywhere around here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		which counties are that where where do you live
 	
 	
 		so
 		i live in uh my i have some my little piece of land is in uh Benedict County and i live in Smith County
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and what state is that in
 	
 	
 		Texas
 	
 	
 		still in Texas
 	
 	
 		still in Texas you hear this Texas accent
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can't get rid of it
 	
 	
 		course in Texas at least you still don't  have income tax
 	
 	
 		well i think we pay it in other ways
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think we i really think we pay it in a lot of other ways it's funny to me too that uh why the government taxes has a tighter higher tax rate for a single person
 		than they do for a married couple
