 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		alright what do you think
 	
 	
 		well uh i think air pollution is a pretty big problem right now and it's i mean i think it's a real bad problem i don't think that a lot is really being done about it at this point
 		and there's just things like uh for a i think that cars especially here in the United States are just a major source of the pollution when you consider that most people have at least one automobile and people drive around all the time
 		and i think you know if you just totaled up i don't know any of the exact figures but all the millions of cars that are driving around spewing out carbon monoxide all the time i think you're going to end up with a pretty big uh number
 		
  
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		um and if you look at other countries like in the third world and stuff where people ride bikes and all that i'm sure that their uh
 		air quality is much better than ours just as a result of their lack of having cars like if you look at Los Angeles i mean they've they said that the major reason that it's so smoggy there is because they all sit and drive down the freeway everyday
 	
 	
 		hum okay well um i i mean also along the same lines i know that there's somebody i i read one time about um somebody's developed uh a test to look at the emissions from um your car
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know you know i i just don't understand i mean everybody's so concerned right now about recycling and everything i think that's pulled away from the focus of air pollution
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we're making all these changes with cars and everything and and and battling to have US built cars versus other countries and we're not looking at  um the air quality that we're producing from our cars
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		right and there was just i just saw today that uh
 		President Bush they were had new a new regulation out that was going to put a canister to collect some of the exhaust fumes on most new cars and he uh
 		is not going to let that regulation pass through because he says that well it's going to cost too much money and take too many jobs away from the people up in Michigan
 		and i just think that's ridiculous that i mean if they've developed the technology to remove some of the harmful pollutants that come out of people's exhaust pipe and not implementing it is just seems kind of ludicrous to me
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i hadn't heard anything about that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well you know until these older model cars i mean granted i have an older model car  but i mean some of the some of the really older ones that you know the mufflers falling off you know and they're not quiet up to specs but they're still being driven around
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and you can i mean i'd go behind somebody the other day and you mean you saw this this huge amount of smoke pouring out the back of their car and you had to change lanes to get away from them
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and i mean if you can see it and smell it that badly on that vehicle think about how many others are pouring out that you can't see and smell
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		right exactly uh the another thing i don't know here in the Midwest in Indiana at least we produce most of our energy burning coal
 		and if you just look at some of these there's a coal burning electricity plant here in town and you can just sit there and watch the the smoke stacks and the amount of pollution that just pours out of there
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i use to live right next to this plant and every single day you would go out and your car would just have you know it's not like three inches of dust or anything but you can see the dust that had come out of this smoke stack and just fallen right down on your car
 		and you know they say that the the coal we burn here in Indiana is responsible for a large part of the acid rain that they have up in New York state and in Canada and all that
 		and it's just you know it's ridiculous when we could be spending the money to develop the technology to you know clean up some these uh
 		sources of pollution like the smoke stacks but then the big businesses say well we can't do it because it's going to cost us too much money and it's like well we kind of got to think a little bit more forward instead of
 		you know we're not going to make as much money this year because we're trying to clean things up i just it kind of
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's
 	
 	
 		bothers me
 	
 	
 		well i know in Dallas um i'm i i live pretty close to downtown to Dallas and you know and there are days you just you open the door and just go huh i'm not leaving here today you know
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and i mean there's uh there's a place that used to be called Concrete City and they have all these things where they used to burn um and and what they would burn off would be lead
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and now you know i mean here they've been spewing this stuff out for forty years or more and they're just now beginning to figure out that you know that what they've done is is wrong
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and now we're trying to clean that up but you know we've seen the visible effects in the soil but it makes me wonder what kind of effects that it's had on the atmosphere that we don't know yet
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and so many of these things takes so many years to develop that we've never you know it'll be past my life time before i see the effects of some of the things that we're doing now
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah all and all i think that we really i mean almost if you look at almost any industry it's it's producing so much pollution i mean they're spewing out just tons of this atmospheric garbage every single year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and something really ought to be done because it it's basically we don't see the problem right now and like you said even the pollution that we're putting out now is not really going to affect anybody for twenty thirty years so i don't think it's got i mean the the past
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
