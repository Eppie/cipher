 
     		
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		where where do you get your current events
 	
 	
 		i'm i don't keep up on current events very well at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		what i what i do on my i keep up on current events by as i walk by the newspaper stand if there is a headline that grabs my attention then i will stand there and look at it for a minute then walk into my office
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		maybe once every six months i'll i'll find something that's interesting enough that i'll buy the paper and then usually i read end up reading a lot of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um do you watch any television
 	
 	
 		uh no oh yeah i do i watch i watch Star Trek and sometimes i watch the Equalizer i never watch the news
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh huh
 	
 	
 		my roommates watch the news sometimes so sometimes i'll get
 		get interested in a news article so i guess a little bit leaks through there and uh sometimes on a on a plane or in a airport i'll i'll be sitting some somewhere and there will be a newspaper next to me and i'll read parts of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't make any deliberate effort to keep up on current events i probably about one of the least informed people  around how about you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well um i used to read the whole paper every day
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and uh when you when i did that i really knew stuff you know i mean if you read the whole paper every day you walk into work and you're like you want to talk to people about
 		so what do you think about the situation in West Pakistan  like this the parliamentary government's not going not you know not going to stay in there and people sort of stare at you uh
 		but now i have a child and i i read the comics every day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um and i sort of glance at the front page uh i also used to listen to um public radio
 		tried to listen to that every evening for the news and every morning and when i when i was doing that and reading the paper i really i really felt informed uh especially having the two different viewpoints uh slightly different anyway uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now i listen to the radio
 		maybe five minutes in the morning and i don't get to listen evening some i'm pretty pretty uninformed uh but those were my two big ones the newspaper and the radio
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a news station here that i listen to sometimes on the way to work but it's a short drive
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh  yeah oh that was the other thing i used to drive to work i used to have a long commute and i would listen to every morning on uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		public radio there's a show called Morning Edition that lasts an hour and a half and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they repeat the main headlines every half-hour so i would listen to two segments of that and you know really really know stuff and now that i'm just walking and riding the bus um
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		i i miss that
 		uh
 		the uh the well during the during the Gulf War we turned on the TV a couple times did you watch watch any more during that
 	
 	
 		in the Gulf War
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh that i have to say that during the Gulf War yeah i watched a lot of CNN
 	
 	
 		the whole Iraq thing
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i really did uh because i was pretty interested in that and i have a a an Iranian roommate
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so he had on constantly
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i'll bet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh so and actually i learned a lot from him about world situations and also i have a bunch of Persian friends because of him and so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you probably learned a lot from them yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and they are always telling me about countries i have never heard of and political political situations that totally amaze me
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah there's so much to know it is amazing
 	
 	
 		and so
 	
 	
 		um
 		well uh one thing that was interesting during that whole thing was i would listen to the radio quite a bit and uh you know i started bringing a radio to work and i would listen a little bit at work and listen on the way home and on the way the way there and uh
 		i really felt like i was keeping up pretty well and then i would watch CNN for you know fifteen minutes or a half hour and see a bunch of pictures and realize i hadn't really learned anything
 		you know they sort of show planes taking off and uh
 		like i i got more visual information but less
 	
 	
 		less content
 	
 	
 		real information in a way
 	
 	
 		they were kind of starved for real information i think at that point because all they had was was military clips and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah and it's almost as though
 		that was stuff was more available to TV so they used it
 	
 	
 		yeah well they have to show something
 	
 	
 		you know they have to show something and that's all they could show on TV they could i mean on the radio they would bring in all sorts of you know experts from God knows where and interview them and talk to them about it and speculate
 		uh i think  in part at least because they had to
 		uh which is kind of interesting so i just found that they the information per hour was much higher on the radio although the TV was a little more compelling
 	
 	
 		i never thought about that
 		the information per hour well technically the information on the TV is higher but the actual content is less
 	
 	
 		right it's it's an interesting question about
 		you know the bandwidth of the television
