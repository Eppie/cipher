 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay want to go ahead and start then
 	
 	
 		sure uh recycling in this community has uh been a problem for the past two years i moved down here two years ago from a community that had had recycling
 		band this particular town uh does not offer municipal trash services so we are all uh under obligation to get our own trash hauled away
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and when i talk to the local trash haulers about recycling they said that uh they could haul it to the recycling site but it would be about twenty dollars a month more
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it was uh fairly amazing to me that this thing that they are trying to mandate throughout the state
 		uh was being snubbed in this particular town
 	
 	
 		hum
 		wow
 		do you guys have like recycling bins
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		for your glass and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		no we don't uh
 		as i said we we are responsible for finding our own trash pick up
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and all the uh trash haulers in this area will take the uh the sorted trash and
 		bring the recyclables to a uh a recycling center but they charge twenty dollars or more a month for that particular service
 	
 	
 		i'll be darned
 		down down here in  isn't too much of a tax burden up here down here it's uh
 		they have uh the the garbage company picks it up for us and they what we do is we have to separate this stuff you know papers and and plastic materials and glass
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh they'll they'll come by in a separate truck and i guess it's paid for with taxpayer's money
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but up there i guess you guys are saving the tax payers uh
 	
 	
 		well uh it it's interesting because this uh the town i live in is a a coastal town that uh
 		during the summer really is a uh a tourist resort type town and uh the population really drops off in the winter so they uh
 		i guess they figure that they wouldn't uh
 		they wouldn't provide that particular service
 	
 	
 		oh i see yeah
 	
 	
 		uh when i when i lived back up uh closer to the city it we had the municipal trash pick up and we sorted the bottles the paper and all of that and uh
 		you know i'd had about a year or so to get used to that whole system and i moved down and i said this is a great you know i like doing this it's not that much of a pain um it sounds good to me
 		what do i do to keep doing this and the answer was you can if you want but it's going to cost you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i was fairly surprised
 	
 	
 		yeah that's it is surprising but it sounds like you're in uh are you near the ocean and stuff then or
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh so you are in a nice place
 	
 	
 		well i really do like it here uh i
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm close to the ocean myself i'm in Juno here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it's it's pretty nice  about uh probably a half mile from the beach i'm not right on it but uh i'm pretty close to
 	
 	
 		right i'm about i'm about uh maybe uh
 		quarter of a mile to a half a mile away
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty good
 		that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		but uh the the other thing about recycling that had uh that i've noticed is i've seen a few articles in the paper now that uh
 		there's more recycled material than people know what to do with
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh apparently the uh the uh the manufacturer glass people the plastics the paper people the glass people aren't using enough of the recyclables
 		to uh
 		to keep the chain going so there's a a back log of of material that was put in for recycling that no one knows what to do with and it's actually
 	
 	
 		hum
 		was that a uh was that a beverage manufacturer that uh wrote that article
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i've seen it a couple of times and i'm i'm i couldn't cite the source  right now
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right
 		well it's true we uh in this state don't have a bottle bill and every time it's raised there is uh that lobby that keeps it down and i it's
 		i i really can't see why people would get that upset about it because once it's in place it doesn't seem all that uh that difficult to manage
