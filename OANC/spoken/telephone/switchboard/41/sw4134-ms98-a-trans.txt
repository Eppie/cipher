 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i've recently dropped my subscription to the local paper well not exactly local it's a pretty big one the Atlanta Journal Constitution because i was thoroughly and totally disgusted with the quality of the paper
 		was really pretty poor and i couldn't see spending half an hour a day looking through that
 	
 	
 		yeah i did the same thing actually i uh don't have a i'm not subscribing anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah i try and watch the news as well we get uh cable here and watch Headline news but it's such a
 		i don't know there's really very little depth to it they seem to be really out to try and entertain more than uh
 		you know pass on any real information it's pretty trashy i'm not happy with it
 	
 	
 		are you unhappy with the uh with the how should i say it uh
 		the one-sidedness of it or or the
 	
 	
 		uh
 		the i think more the uh the just the the real lack of meat behind it i think there was an article in some local news magazine recently that mentioned it  talked about the uh uh level of
 		uh reading ability or something or other and things like President Bush's uh statements to the public and they were comparing him with Michael Dukakis back during the old uh
 		the the last election nonsense and they were talking about how Dukakis his statements were like in a tenth to twelfth grade reading level while Bush's were down around an eighth grade level and by that
 		uh being able to convey to that larger much larger of an audience you know he
 		was supposedly that much more an effective communicator and i think that's the same problem with the news is they're trying to communicate with maybe so many people that it's just coming out really pretty poor
 	
 	
 		my my problem is that they just don't uh
 		how should i say it i i can either get uh things on one side or the other but not uh a meaningful discussion
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that relates to well how should i say i either get these highly polarized things
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree
 	
 	
 		and sometimes they're i say okay we're going to we're going to do uh
 		uh
 		we're going to be fair so we're going to present two highly polarized articles which which is uh better than than one but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's like uh trying to maintain a temperature in your house by running the heater and the air conditioner at the same time
 	
 	
 		so uh anyway so we're uh
 		one of the problems the other problem that i have is that that uh
 		as you said uh a lot of the articles are they're either fluff
 		uh well actually out of the press they're they're fluff or they're uh
 		pretty shallow but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		course i have i also have the option and i guess you do too of signing up for one of these
 		uh specialty magazines which is like in the case of uh
 		science you know you sign up for
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah they are good
 	
 	
 		Nature or something like that but
 	
 	
 		i'm surprised at the the the range and quality of things that are out there like Scientific American there's such a broad uh spectrum of science and yet it's really in depth at the same time
 	
 	
 		but when it comes to news uh it's a i find it i i think the reason perhaps for that is that the uh
 		the uh press like everything else is is becoming a
 		uh how should i say is becoming
 		they're not neighborhood uh press anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah and national
 	
 	
 		they're worried more they're more like U S A Today type things uh pretty shallow and and can we make it uh and they're run by you have ten newspapers that are run by uh
 	
 	
 		held by the same company
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree we recently had Newsweek at the house but went ahead and dropped it decided it really wasn't what we were looking for and we started subscription to U S News And World Report but it hasn't started arrived yet
 		going to try and evaluate that you know another interesting source of news is the is E-mail the network news do you get that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's yes that's one of the most interesting that's how i found out about this
 	
 	
 		yeah me too i really if if i when i move when i go to my next job i'm really going to be uh upset if i don't have access to that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well there are some places here in town uh for people that are
 		uh
 		having uh withdrawal pains so to speak uh there's a bookstore that has a uh
 		uh subscription type thing where you can pay the guy forty dollars a a year which is pretty small potatoes
 	
 	
 		oh that's cheap and you get to call in across a modem
 	
 	
 		yeah call in on the modem and you can read your news i mean read your mail and uh and uh look at the all the different internet uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		man
 	
 	
 		uh groups
 	
 	
 		excellent yeah that really seems to be a a one of the cutting leading
