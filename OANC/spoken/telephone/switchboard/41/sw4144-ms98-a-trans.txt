 
     		
 	
 		to uh  trial by jury and whether it works or not is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hey i like the current system
 	
 	
 		yeah i expect it's um  about as good as one can expect um
 		i suppose you get an illogical verdict now and then but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i figure the answer to that is to educate the consumers or the uh
 	
 	
 		the
 		the jurors you mean the people
 	
 	
 		right  just
 	
 	
 		yeah i just got called to my first jury duty uh-huh
 		i never been on a jury how about you
 	
 	
 		hey
 		two weeks ago
 		first time i was ever called
 	
 	
 		and were you did you did you show up and do it or whatever it was
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i showed up but uh the case settled before they could uh
 		make us uh actually listen to anything so i have no idea what the case was about or uh you know i didn't get to do anything
 	
 	
 		my brother was on some real complex business case where they were um
 		decide to asked to decide the exact amount to the penny of fraud in some credit card case you know
 	
 	
 		wait so the jury had to like go over
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		ledgers and financial records and
 	
 	
 		well they went over it in the trial but they didn't give the stuff to the jury afterward it was really bizarre uh
 	
 	
 		wait a second don't
 		don't they have to enter that in as evidence and can't the jury request any piece of it
 	
 	
 		yeah but they have to ask for it and then the the bailiff brings it and they can look at it then the bailiff takes it away again it's not like they can just spread it out in their jury room and then you know get out a bunch of calculators and pocket computers and add it all up it was
 	
 	
 		right the the jurors request an IBM three seventy
 	
 	
 		yeah right would you give me an IDMS IDMS system or something like that  dear judge
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know it was it was a very peculiar case i guess that one was didn't work very well um uh but
 	
 	
 		whoa that i'm not sure that's the jury's fault
 	
 	
 		no no i don't think so either um
 	
 	
 		but i don't know what else they could've done
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah um i guess i guess nothing else but uh
 	
 	
 		TI suggests just giving it to the judge but uh
 	
 	
 		well
 		for sentencing i don't know does that make any sense i mean
 		it depends on what i i don't know what the offense is i guess that's why we have juries is to take each case on a case by case basis and that's fine
 		anyway um
 	
 	
 		no i mean the jury
 		there's problems with it as far as finding jurors as far as weird verdicts
 		as far as just the timing the timing you know it takes a lot of time
 		but uh
 		you know i like it because i think
 		you don't have the abuse or it's a sort of a check
 		if you have one guy doing something he can sort of
 		go out of control and it's a long time before he gets reigned in
 	
 	
 		yeah or if it's an organizational problem you know where where you know the
 	
 	
 		and he can do a lot of damage
 	
 	
 		you know it's possible to imagine a corrupt judicial system where you know all the judges are are
 		part of the system i guess that happened in Chicago once huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or just even one guy just before you get a chance to uh
 		you know to uh purge him
 		he could do a lot of damage
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i guess they do anyway i guess
 		the only trouble with the jury system i see is it's really darned darned expensive and and you know time consuming and
 		you know and and all these systems of where you can like
 		ask a jury ask each juror what they think about something then kick them out and
 		you know i guess they can manipulate it a little
 	
 	
 		you know maybe some of the uh
 		like the hype
 		needs to be cut out
 		but you mention expense
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think you get what you pay for
 	
 	
 		yeah it's true no lie
 	
 	
 		you know if you want a cheap legal system you're you're gonna get that kind of
 		Kmart service or uh
 		well Kmart's not all that bad
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there's got to be some sort of cheap
 		what's the epitome of cheap these days
 	
 	
 		beats me um
 		yeah in in Massachusetts it's the judicial system their buildings are all falling down
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i guess that gets them the sample
 		good night sir
 	
 	
 		all right good luck
 	
 	
 		take it easy
