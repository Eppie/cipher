 
     		
 	
 		let's see mine's pretty easy actually uh i just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new Saturns
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and although i can't afford it right now i would just like love to have one
 	
 	
 		oh really you like uh so you're an American
 		you want to buy American
 	
 	
 		well
 		no regardless of that fact it's the best car in the class for the best cheapest amount of money
 		i'm interested in having it for uh doing a little auto cross racing uh closed circuit racing and uh it seems to just blow the competition competition competition away
 	
 	
 		um
 		in terms of handling uh acceleration
 	
 	
 		handling power everything yeah it just got like the top rating it was compared up against uh
 		let's see
 		there was like the Mazda
 		M X three uh Nissan's whatever their two N X two thousand
 		the Civic S I
 		and it just you know it it dominated over all of them everybody all the uh raters loved it i like the i like the styling and i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it
 	
 	
 		what about Mustang GTs
 	
 	
 		Mustang GTs uh can't afford it
 	
 	
 		those so you're talking about ones in a lower lower end price price range
 	
 	
 		right yeah i'm a graduate student
 		let's face it i don't make any money so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money you can buy whatever you want
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah we'll see then
 		yeah right now i'm stuck i i've got a a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo
 		that it's fast but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing but it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the go Saturn
 	
 	
 		right would you use that for city driving and racing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i'd do it i'd use it for both the nice thing about auto crossing is you can you can do both
 	
 	
 		auto crossing is what kind of track is that
 	
 	
 		uh just like a um
 		um
 		set up a lot of times and it's like really large uh parking lots
 	
 	
 		okay and you put up set up the track pylons okay
 	
 	
 		and pylons and things
 		tight turns hard acceleration i've seen a lot of Mustangs uh compete
 		and
 		it's interesting they get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah i would guess so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh what are you thinking about buying
 	
 	
 		uh i think i'd like to get uh BMW or if i go the German route which i'm kind of leaning towards right now but
 		uh or maybe a Honda i mean a a Acura Legend
 	
 	
 		the Legend
 	
 	
 		uh a Lexus
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh S C three hundred maybe
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		something on that order i haven't really determined if i like the the Japanese or the if i like them enough to purchase one
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know because your BMWs your German cars have good reputations i think
 	
 	
 		yeah well i was i was actually in uh a lot of the BMW's are produced in uh  uh Stuttgart and uh and Munich and i was i was there this uh summer
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i i was really impressed by the uh the uh factory uh tours and such for BMW
 	
 	
 		the
 		yeah they their they have the whole philosophy i mean they they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is kind of hard to take
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		i mean as you're walking through that little tour in uh Munich it's kind of  they're trying to brainwash you too
 	
 	
 		oh of course of course they are they want you to buy their car yeah there it was it was interesting i was at i i also went to uh the Porsche and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah the uh
 		yeah the uh the BMW is really oh like oh we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and
 		and then you go to Porsche and it's like well uh these cars are completely handmade and no two of them are alike
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		and so it's like completely opposed i don't know which do i like better i think i like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical
 	
 	
 		no it's not realistic
 	
 	
 		unless it's it's a toy
 	
 	
 		yeah if you can afford that kind of a toy then i guess so
 	
 	
 		let's face it
 		yeah yeah but it it BMW's good for that what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah just work short trips no mileage no heavy mileage i'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year
 	
 	
 		wow yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's pretty minimal
 	
 	
 		that's cool
 	
 	
 		lasts a long time that's mainly what i'm looking for
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good i also i was impressed by uh
 		by the Mercedes too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i really i really like the Mercedes the factory was nice and
 	
 	
 		but
 		but if if you have a problem with a Mercedes you take it into a shop they're going to they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things
 	
 	
 		and is it different for the for the BMW
 	
 	
 		uh i think well something on the order of a three series it's probably different once you get up in the five series and higher then
 	
 	
 		probably
 	
 	
 		all your repair costs go up significantly
 	
 	
 		right  i  can imagine that
 	
 	
 		so i'm kind yeah i'm not sure if i really want
