 
     		
 	
 		personally
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		prefer sports cars and responsive cars i like to uh to drive kind of fast i guess but i'm finding that as i get older
 		i'm thinking that it would also be nice to have kind of a a nicer bigger maybe more luxurious luxurious car to have in addition to the one i already have
 	
 	
 		um-hum what kind of car do you have right now
 	
 	
 		it's a uh Dodge Daytona it's a Shelby Z they only made them for for one year it's really just a variation on the other Daytonas that they have out but i'm real happy with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's uh an eighty seven and it's the first turbo charge car i ever owned and i was a little little reluctant about that because i heard things about
 		uh other people that owned turbo charge cars that the turbo would break quite often be very expensive to fix but i haven't had any problems with it
 	
 	
 		yeah i know my father-in-law has have a has a turbo charged uh engine on his truck and he's had some some problems with that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but um he put the turbo on himself and uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		there was some problems right from the start with that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh how old is uh how old is the truck
 	
 	
 		well i think it's probably about an eighty seven also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		excuse me but i guess my tastes in vehicles are just a little bit different um um i've been more into just kind of a family car small
 		uh not real big car uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but lately we've been uh trying to get something that's a little bit more reliable so we've been going with uh Toyota vehicles lately
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm more into pick up trucks lately i i got myself uh myself a pick up truck last spring
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i'm more interested in the the off road that kind of thing hauling things around
 	
 	
 		oh sure yeah we just recently bought a second car and we ended up getting a Jeep Wrangler
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it's funny though because it's this is actually my wife's car the Jeep and uh
 		but it's fun having four wheel drive capability and a rugged suspension like that to go out and do things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but we're still finding that when we end up driving other people places that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it would be nice to have something where something roomier where people didn't have to duck their heads or scrunch their knees up and
 		something that would ride a little more smoothly especially when when you travel
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		which we do a a fair bit of traveling
 	
 	
 		yeah i know we do a lot of that yeah on the road traveling and we we have a Toyota Camry for that kind of traveling
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that's a little bit more comfortable it's it's not real fancy but it's a lot more comfortable than a lot of the other vehicles we've had prior to that
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 		it's uh
 		i don't know when you're when you're used to one thing i guess something different always seems like it would be fun to have or nice to have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		are you pretty satisfied with your Jeep as far as repair and reliability on it
 	
 	
 		yeah we haven't had it for very long we got it in September right around uh Labor Day i guess it was and so it doesn't have a whole lot of miles on it yet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh up here in Rochester New York it's nice to have a four wheel drive capability especially on days like today where we have about six inches of snow coming down out there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we just got that a few days ago here in Wisconsin so
 	
 	
 		yeah i was a little uh surprised to find i i'm not the sort of person that's going to go out and shop for exclusively for an American built car but i am the sort of person that feels good knowing that the car they like the best is American
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		made and American built but i was reading in the paper the other day that uh
 		surprisingly enough a lot of cars that you think are American aren't always and in fact they listed the Jeep Wrangler as being almost exclusively made in either Mexico or Canada
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which isn't that far away but i it surprised me i always thought Jeep was about as American as you could get as far as manufacturing goes at least
 	
 	
 		well it kind of goes the other way with the vehicles that we've had because the Toyota we have now was built in i think Tennessee
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and the uh
 		before that we had a a Volkswagen Jetta which was made in Philadelphia or somewhere in Pennsylvania i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but you wouldn't think that just off the top of your head you'd think they're German or or Japanese made
 	
 	
 		no yeah
 		yeah i guess you never know in fact they had a whole system uh decoding the vehicle identification number
 		so you could figure out even right down to where the factory was which state the factory was in where it built
 	
 	
 		yeah i read that in the paper the other day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		found that interesting
 	
 	
 		but
 		
  
 		it was interesting
 	
 	
 		we used to have a Jeep a long time ago when we were first married and i i swore i'd never get one again because we had so many problems with it it was just a a a never ending uh stay at the the repair shop it just
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh no
 		oh really what sorts of problems did you have with it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well the carburetion never really worked quite right and there
