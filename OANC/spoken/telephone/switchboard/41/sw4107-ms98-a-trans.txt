 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so well what what are you guys doing with recycling
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well i mean in DC there's a law uh that was recently passed that like um
 		you have to  it's a law i think that organizations
 		have to provide recycling i guess recycling bins they have to recycle it's a law to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah they just they just did the same thing up here uh the whole county built a uh uh incinerator actually only two thirds of the county built it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they also of course they had to the New York State EEC the environmental people mandate that you have to recycle things so anybody who wants funding or doesn't want their landfills closed and sued
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		has to uh recycle
 	
 	
 		it's like um i mean personally i've never been a recycling nut in terms of like i don't i don't go out of my way and i think like they put uh receptacles around campus and the dorms and that makes me
 		um  more apt to do it because it's there it's more convenient
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of people up here the exact same way you know they won't lift a finger
 		and uh it hasn't gotten around here that you know you go to any store or something and there is a trash can there isn't a bin for glass a bin for
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's it's really just on the verge it it hasn't quite happened yet but that you know i was on vacation a couple places uh
 		uh Utah had some bins
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i'm looking right here there's a waste bin  for waste i don't know i guess they recycle i guess they can recycle
 		normal waste i'm not really sure and there's trash cans too i mean generally when i'm right when i if i go by the waste bin i'll put something in there if it fits  they've got cans and bottles um and bins for paper
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you wouldn't walk around for a long time with a can in your hand because you couldn't found a uh a bin for it
 	
 	
 		no
 		no not really i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		toss it in the first place that it  that you could find
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean like the right now i'm in uh our student center studying and i'll go out of my i'll walk up get up from my table and walk out of my way i mean well they're right near the trash can so i'll i'll toss it in the bin but um
 		as far as if i'm walking in the street drinking a soda and i finish it i'm going to toss it in the nearest trash can probably
 		i mean it's convenient it's it's there if the the recycling bin is not there i'm probably i'm if it was there i'd use it
 	
 	
 		right well i think well maybe that's a good way to uh promote recycling is just to make it more available
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		exactly i mean even in my in my dorm it's in the basement but i pile it i let i let them pile up in the trash in my uh in the garbage in um a giant bag a a shopping bag and then uh take it down in the basement and toss it in the uh recycling trash can
 		um but yeah i mean more receptacles uh around on the streets even would would um make people do it
 		i mean if it's there they're going to do it still i mean some people won't even go that far out of their way
 		there are people who are pretty ignorant and i mean or are really set in their ways
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess you know my mom she always recycled everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm use to it but
 		if i was use to just throwing things away it would be a really tough habit to unlearn
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so maybe you know the next generation will be a little bit more uh conscientious than we are
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm sure they will i mean with uh the way things are going i mean uh it's going towards a more green
 		type of thing
 		green thinking should call it
 		people more aware
 		more aware they need to save the environment and all that
 	
 	
 		course you are on a college campus where people are more aware than the general public
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh definitely i mean there's been plenty of uh up roar about the uh Marriott using um styrofoam cups and styrofoam plates and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now now that's really tough because you read stuff and you can't tell whether a styrofoam plate is actually more or less wasteful than a paper one or some other plastic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		cause i mean yeah the paper ones are have plastic coated and they're probably even worse i don't really know
 	
 	
 		yeah who knows what's not
 	
 	
 		harder to recycle
 	
 	
 		and uh you know if you put them in a landfill they take up the same amount of space
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because the paper doesn't break down either
 	
 	
 		well i think it's possible to recycle styrofoam but it's more expensive
 		um
 		they do have reusable cups that people can uh i mean basically you've got carry around this cup if you want to if you want to be uh environmentally um conscious
 		and they i believe they give discounts on on drinks if you have this cup so that's kind of incentive
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you have a discount on your on your on your drink instead of the regular price or whatever
 	
 	
 		well that that's good i mean God forbid you should actually you know have a cup and then wash it out once and a while and reuse it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah like
 		imagine that
