 
     		
 	
 		okay well um i used to work in a day care center i worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center and  it is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they can be deceiving to people i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three um centers
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		all over you know the um city and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um i think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks
 		and um to check in on them when they're not expecting it because they do do things differently when you're not around
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well that i know what the things that we kind of looked at is is you wanna see how many teachers you have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and how many kids they have and how they break it up
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because we had  we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it it was a really good one and in fact it worked out for us because my wife we kind of bartered my wife did artwork for them and then you know so we got our
 		uh day care free
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but they didn't have enough teachers
 	
 	
 		well this one was set up good i mean they had two teachers to every room
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um sometimes three and they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the problem i had was that
 		they did not show affection to the children enough they did not show them care to these small children who are being left
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um they
 		one time i picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side and down the other you know he said you are gonna have every child in here wanting you to pick them up
 	
 	
 		hm
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i said no this child was crying and needed some comfort you know what is your problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		did did they separate them by age group
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		because i'd think you know i think that's one thing that was important
 	
 	
 		right they did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room the ones that were starting to walk in one room then they had like the um three three year olds
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives you know just like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they really did separate them well it was just the teachers themselves
 	
 	
 		it it sound yeah
 		it sounds like to me your  your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people
 	
 	
 		right but yeah that they're not
 	
 	
 		affectionate people that they're they're kind of parents  maybe parents themselves or something
 	
 	
 		yeah their system
 		right but their but their system was was great but um the
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		you know the caring just wasn't there the one woman that taught that did the babies
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i worked with her and she was fabulous she loved them babies and she loved them and cared for them but um every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um you know would make me a nervous wreck so you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have
 		doctorates and PhD's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff
 		but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good
 	
 	
 		yeah these kids are just in a day care center all day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh with no any type of emotional
 		you know getting love getting care they're just there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know going through this routine which is lousy
 	
 	
 		and
 		the other the other group that we had was kind of interesting the other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team and we knew them from other associations but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one and i think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know but he was actually the more
 		um
 		the more uh what demonstrative type the more loving he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it it it was kind of interesting to see that that that it was actually the man in the group that
 		that did that side of it and
 	
 	
 		yeah you don't see that much
 	
 	
 		yeah so they had a really nice balance we liked that one in fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something but they also did
 	
 	
 		that's cute
 	
 	
 		they also did some of the teaching things and then they had um
 		you know obedience obedience was important
 	
 	
 		yeah that has to be with a day care center
 	
 	
 		and you know so they used you know they used uh
 		oh i think they used the you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself
 	
 	
 		i've never heard of that that's that's a new one on me
 	
 	
 		and it's it's it's one uh i can't remember what they call it exactly but you you just stand them in front of the clock and you know it has a second hand that goes around
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they have to stand there
