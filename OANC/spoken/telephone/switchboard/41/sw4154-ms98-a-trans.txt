 
     		
 	
 		what do you feel about the um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		present situation in the Mideast
 	
 	
 		well it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what do you think Mark
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd agree i think i think there's definitely been some changes um and i think you know the
 		the um end of the Soviet Union will definitely have it's effect on on the situation
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know in that
 		there's there's not you know there you know if
 		you know it's basically since the end of World War II there was always you know that little proxy war going on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know with um
 		the US funding Israel and you had the um
 		Soviet Union funding the Arab countries
 	
 	
 		and then we'll see what happens when uh they're not funded quite as much or supplied with arms the same way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum yeah but on the same token you know
 		Israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the US in being you know the foothold of capitalism
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know in
 		in the Mideast
 	
 	
 		well i we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves you know we support kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		overall tend to support them but i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war uh in uh Kuwait was uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the fact that they did not retaliate for the uh Scud missiles that were
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh launched there that just seemed to me to be a uh a phenomenal uh demonstration of restraint and it must have reflected uh uh some awful good uh diplomacy on the part of the US
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yeah but on the other hand you know if
 		they would've had a hard time retaliating because
 		they you know they they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		they basically would've you know had a had a fly they'd had they would've had had to fly through you know two enemies
 	
 	
 		uh you don't think they've got the codes from the US already
 	
 	
 		the US had claimed that they would have not given them to them
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		i mean of course you know
 		public statements can be taken for
 	
 	
 		that's true  they can can't they
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah well what do you what about this situation with uh you know the uh
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		continual uh harassment by Iraq right now and uh apparently failing to let the in uh arms inspectors have free access
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you know it
 		
 
 		well to begin with you know i pretty much question our what what the US's motives were in uh in in actually the original involvement
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um  i
 		the cynical side of me says that you know who it was more for
 		uh um
 		the the domestic political situation than for anything else
 	
 	
 		hm yeah okay
 	
 	
 		you know and that you know and for portraying Bush as a strong president
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		um i mean i really i really think that that
 		my gut feeling is that that that you know he pretty much picked picked a fight with um
 		with um Hussein i mean i'm not not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to get enter that fight
 	
 	
 		um
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i i think i think that
 		that um
 		we chose to have our official feelings hurt
 	
 	
 		um-hum well do you think that uh we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and uh
 	
 	
 		we're a lot
 	
 	
 		you know move on into Kuwait and see what happened
 	
 	
 		i think i mean i thought
 		i think that
 		um
 		in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i i really don't i really don't think that
 		i think i think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than
 		true foreign policy interests
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well may have been you know i'm not saying that that's not the case uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i mean in in in along those line since
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		since you know it really it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting getting uh
 		the Iraqis out of Kuwait
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i just don't i just don't
 		i i i don't i i i don't foresee
 		Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and
 		you know in in fighting a second battle
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know over over the um
 		over over what what what probably won't accomplish him accomplish much for him politically
 	
 	
 		no it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do to do much more in there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		even at this point
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah well what about uh
 		do you have any any views on uh Israel's relation to the US do you think we ought to you know back off on our support of the country or what do you
 	
 	
 		well i have i have very mixed feelings about Israel um
 		i think that
 		that for a long while we've we've had almost a
 		you know had had this
