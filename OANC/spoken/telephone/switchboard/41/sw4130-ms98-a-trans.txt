 
     		
 	
 		so Julie how do you feel about AIDS research
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think we need we definitely need more of it definitely
 	
 	
 		i'd agree too but i mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know
 		um you know it would have made even better economic sense to to to have had a lot more research done a longer longer longer ago
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah for certain
 	
 	
 		you know because
 		you know because um the country's gonna wind up paying for the treatment of patients
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly does does like do do health insurance policies like for companies and things do they cover
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		diseases like that
 	
 	
 		i think they cover AIDS but what they do is um if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy they'll um check to see if you're HIV positive
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and if you are not only will they not give you um a policy but they'll um they have like there's like you know a database of people that have tested positive so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again
 	
 	
 		um well that's but that's why they should have started started doing stuff before i mean still you know since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are draining a lot of money right now you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think a lot of it was was just that
 		you know because because of of the audience you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were in people that no one really cared about
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		that
 	
 	
 		right and all these God fearing people were like well you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah um
 		yeah one one one humorous one humorous retort i heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know AIDS was you know God's punishment was that then lesbians must be God's chosen people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		boy that's a good one
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um do you think we're do you mean do you think we're actually doing enough right now to
 	
 	
 		no i really don't i did i did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff and uh
 		really we're not doing much at all i mean most of what gets raised i mean it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by um
 		uh
 		uh you know uh conscious yeah communities and things like that you know like uh San Francisco has uh
 	
 	
 		private organizations
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a real um strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff and and uh get they get donations from the community you know they're real and from corporations around the around the city you know for AIDS research and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i mean it seems that you know
 		it's just you know of it's just gonna reach a steady a steady state a let a lot lot higher point than it will if we you know we'd nip it in the bud just to quote quote Barney Fife
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		i don't know i don't know i I i don't know what the likelihood of that is there you know people really waking up especially with the ultra conservative
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		move our our political system sort of seems seems to be taking
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		i would probably agree with that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		so do do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support
 		of
 		um people
 	
 	
 		God that's a good question Fish i don't know um
 		i think i think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or or
 		research per se but but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the the work place and out of society you know kind of like lepers would you know and it's really it's it's really not necessary
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		until until the uh disease reaches its final stage you know becomes really infectious
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh uh uh i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand
 		you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		cut off from from a community and that and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess i think that that um
 		research is i guess the most important just because i
 		you know it it really needs to come to an end
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't know i don't know Fish what do you think about that subject
 	
 	
 		uh i think it's i think it stands a really interesting question of
 		um
