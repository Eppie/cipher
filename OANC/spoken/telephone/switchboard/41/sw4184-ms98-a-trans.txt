 
     		
 	
 		you have any pets
 	
 	
 		yes do you have do i have pets yes i have a cat and i have two dogs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		two dogs what kind
 	
 	
 		i have a Schnauzer and i have a Sheltie
 	
 	
 		Schnauzers is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer
 	
 	
 		it it's a miniature um-hum hm
 	
 	
 		uh i'm going into all this because i used to work i just got done working at a pet shop actually
 	
 	
 		oh okay well the Schnauzer i'm i'm watching for one of uh the managers where i work and he's been transferred to Germany for a while
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and i'm taking care of his dog and uh and i had just got the kitten when he asked me that and he says well my dog doesn't like cats and i said well we won't tell him it's a cat we won't tell her it's a cat
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because it was a kitten and you know they just they just love kittens they just are fascinated
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so she doesn't know that this is a cat yet  and they get along real good i said if Tom could see his dog lick this kitty he'd flip  so that was interesting
 	
 	
 		that's good they say
 		didn't expect that would happen yeah that's cool that's nice
 		um let's see what was the other dog you had
 	
 	
 		it's a Sheltie she's real sweet sweet little dog she's got a very nice temperament uh they're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer you know the Schnauzers are a little aggressive
 	
 	
 		oh a Sheltie
 		yeah
 		they can be nippy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah Shelties are nice everybody seems to be really happy with them they're good temperament
 	
 	
 		they're a good temperament and they
 	
 	
 		they put up with a lot
 	
 	
 		and they just uh  i think they have a good head on their shoulders i think they have a a higher level of intelligence than other uh dogs that i've encountered
 	
 	
 		Schnauzers in particular probably
 	
 	
 		well yeah but also some poodles uh they're kind of um there are some smart ones out there but there's some also some uh not so smart ones  i
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah i get it seems the smaller the are the the worse off they are
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's maybe that's there's uh some credence in that statement
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're bred down so much it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they aren't the best pets
 	
 	
 		i i'd i really don't know what the best pet is i guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i mean some people seem fairly well suited for for uh miniature poodles and such
 	
 	
 		hm
 		and Bulldogs  but i don't know about these uh these um uh these Pinschers these no what are they called Pit Bulls Pit Bulls that are so vicious
 	
 	
 		
 
 		pit bull
 		oh they're nice they're actually very friendly dogs
 	
 	
 		are they really i don't think i've ever seen one
 	
 	
 		uh they're really nice i i have dealt with quite a few of them people uh customers that bring them into the shop and ask me to like
 		they uh  fit collars and stuff on them and they're they're just really nice really friendly um kind of like medium intelligence um
 	
 	
 		well how do they becomes well how did they get their reputation then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well because some people um want to train them as
 	
 	
 		oh they train them to be that way then oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah you really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way yeah it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		oh dear so the the poor animal is doing it in self protection oh dear
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah they aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters they are very determined critters and so once you get them going it's not good to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to deal with but they i i really like them i was i was impressed by them they're they're real sturdy little critters and they aren't that big and uh just really friendly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's unusual i was huh well i suppose you were surprised
 	
 	
 		i was i was overwhelmed
 		yeah uh right now
 	
 	
 		after the reputation that you know they have quite an uh uh notable reputation as far as you know
 	
 	
 		they picked up a lot of bad press lately
 	
 	
 		yeah they're banned from in some areas i understand um-hum
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 		but any any  any pet's gonna can can be bad if you train it to be that way
 	
 	
 		you know that they must have just targeted that breed and said boy we're gonna
 	
 	
 		well yeah it's when in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		because they had one incident of a ferret uh
 		attacking a kid a child in a house i mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret the the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild
 	
 	
 		oh okay uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know
 		they should expect something like that to happen and so basically now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town
 	
 	
 		uh oh did it attack the child then
 	
 	
 		yeah it it bit him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		that was that was not a good thing but i think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was fairly it was a fairly wild ferret and they hadn't
 	
 	
 		well the the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that
 	
 	
 		yeah i they really should've should've expected it and taken the precautions they didn't it's too bad it happened though
 	
 	
 		none um
 		sure yeah
 		yeah because then the the the animal's in trouble and not the person
 	
 	
 		right
