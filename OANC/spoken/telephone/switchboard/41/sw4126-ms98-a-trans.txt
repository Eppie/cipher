 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so do you exercise
 	
 	
 		yeah i just started about uh two months ago consistently doing it um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh i walk jog three times a week for about an hour
 	
 	
 		oh huh
 	
 	
 		yeah so i've just gotten up to um being able to jog one and a half to two miles and then
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um about mile and a half of walking
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well i do a lot of walking at work because i'm outside a lot so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh okay what kind of work do you do
 	
 	
 		i'm in the Air Force
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so i'm outside a lot i work on airplanes so i do a lot of walking there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay so you consider that your exercise
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but i
 		need to work on
 		getting into an exercise program really
 	
 	
 		hum what kind of exercise program would you think you might want to get into
 	
 	
 		uh just basically the the uh
 		uh up my uh you know heart rate and respiration and stuff just to keep it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		going because i've noticed i've been getting a little tired lately
 	
 	
 		maintain it
 		oh well what kind of things do you like to do like um do you like to run or play a sport or
 	
 	
 		well i kind of
 	
 	
 		bicycle ride
 	
 	
 		i kind of like bicycle riding and and running a little bit i don't you know really particular like running but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah  well it's kind of hard on the joints
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's a lot of other things to do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		bicycle riding is pretty good for you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you don't have to put any um shock no it doesn't shock your joints or there's no pounding or anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah huh
 	
 	
 		yeah so you think you might get an exercise bicycle
 	
 	
 		oh i might i got a a regular bicycle out in the
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		out in the garage but it's it's been kind of raining and stuff around here lately so there ain't been much of a chance to go riding a bicycle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's the problem with with that is like if you wanna be consistent and then the weather's bad you can't really or get out when it's cold or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i have an exercise bike at home but i don't use it  it just kind of sits there in the corner
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah but you got a good exercise program going on it looks like
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah and the reason that i'm doing it is because i have a friend doing it with me otherwise i wouldn't have the motivation
 	
 	
 		yeah so your motivation is having somebody do it with you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's you know i'm a student and i'm in school all day and i'm really tired the end of the day and a lot of times i just wanna go home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and
 		and eat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but knowing that my friend's waiting for me you know i meet her at the stadium where we work out um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it makes me go and then after i do it i i'm glad i went and i enjoy it and i have more energy yeah after you do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so and we encourage each other
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah well i went on a trip once and me and the the guy i went with we went to the gym three times a week and worked out so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		that i got into that and then when i got back home i just couldn't keep into it because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it's
 	
 	
 		it's hard you let other things get in the way and and the you're busy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and if you have a family and
 	
 	
 		yeah i got one son and he kind of keeps me a little busy around the house and
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of hard to it's like you have to schedule a time and stick to it but it's hard when
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you don't have somebody to do it with you it's easy to just say well i'm not gonna do it today but i'll do it tomorrow and then you never do it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's and plus my work schedule because there's times i go in at all different hours and it's kind of hard to keep a steady
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 		yeah that would be tough
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well
 	
 	
 		that's what hurts me a lot about getting into a exercise program
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well maybe you can
 		you can um
 		i don't know do a lot of walking like you are and
 		do calisthenics or something i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or get an exercise bike and in the house
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've been looking at them
 		uh Nordic Tracks
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i hear they're supposed to be pretty good huh
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah i have a friend that has one and she said it's really really good it works a lot a lot of your muscles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		she just does it thirty thirty minutes three times a week
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that's not too much time
 	
 	
 		no not really well that's part of what the brochure said too you know twenty thirty minutes a day and or three times a week or however
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		you see if you just keep that up you know that's not too much time and then i bet it'll really improve your you know your cardiovascular system and and all of that because they say even if you just do that it increases
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		your life span i don't know how much but
