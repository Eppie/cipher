 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it seems to me that the the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the the same things that that are to their determent
 		um they aren't as as responsive both to like bad economic times you don't have to worry about your job all of a sudden disappearing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but when you see a job when you see a a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to to get it done you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah see i work for a really small company it's just me and my boss
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so it's really small and i think it's really nice because you know it's it's real easy we don't really have much to do but it's just me and him so if he needs something done i do it or
 		you know it just goes straight from me to him and we don't have to go through a bunch of people like you're saying but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but sometimes it's kind of bad because if i'm sick then i kind of i usually have to go in unless i'm you know have to stay in bed because i'm the only one there yeah
 	
 	
 		there is that i mean well and then i guess again i i guess like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i don't show up for for work there's probably somebody else that could fill my spot but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i imagine and and that's nice but uh it's would it's also nice to be able to uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		know that that you are the person that that makes things get done you know if if you're not there it doesn't happen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and also also in big companies they have uh like vacations and all no if i take a vacation i've got to get a friend or someone else to come in for a temporary to come in for a week
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh wow oh wow
 	
 	
 		yeah so  so it's pretty nice being able to take off and have someone else take your take up your time and all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you know one other benefit that that just occurred to me i didn't take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in  sometimes big companies will pay for like education
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i had some friends of mine uh get sent up to Stanford for a year for uh college or for like for grad school and i guess getting stuck in California for the summer is is not such a bad thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know but uh
 	
 	
 		a friend of mine works for a a stockbroker and um it's a really it's a big company and they said that um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as a after she works there a year as long as she takes business courses they'll reimburse her
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's pretty nice so that she could move up in the company
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's pretty nice my job won't do that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but i would think that a a smaller company you would have a i mean if if if a small company hits some niche in the some niche market that that it is uniquely qualified to
 		um take care of it has a chance to to grow really fast
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and if you can get on top of it before before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of course i guess if there's only the two of you you'll i mean i guess you're you're one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh um the only other thing i can think of is uh uh stuff for
 		things like uh like if if there's some kind of child care if if someone were married and had kids
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		bigger companies might have something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be nice
 	
 	
 		and uh um  like like it's their i guess another advantage might be that uh if they if it's big a big enough company and it has multiple sites
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you wanted to live in another part of the country
 	
 	
 		yeah they moved uh my dad worked for i'm not even sure where but they moved us from Dallas to San Antonio and then back to Dallas
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 		we kind of got moved around but it was pretty nice because you know we lived in San Antonio for a while and all
 		i mean i guess it's nice if you have family that lives somewhere else and you want to be next be near them you can see it switch through the company to over at that state or whatever
 	
 	
 		which i guess i being with a small company you wouldn't get forced to move but do you think uh do you think it was good to to move around or not
 	
 	
 		yeah i do i mean i think it kind of helped us because you know we weren't just living in Dallas and didn't exactly know just everything about Dallas and you know i mean i doubt seriously that
 		if we had stayed here that i would have been able to move to to get to San Antonio very much so
 	
 	
 		oh you had family in San Antonio
 	
 	
 		no we had family in Dallas and we moved to San Antonio and we were kind of like everybody else is in Oklahoma and Louisiana
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so but i guess it was pretty nice because you know we got to experience living down there somewhere different
 	
 	
 		see i'm trying to decide my dad was in the military which is i guess if you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a number of people but uh although it's getting smaller every every day um
 		and we moved like oh man we used to move like every every three years at least
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and like i don't know
 		i mean there's well there's i i've kept in touch with some people from college but but i don't i mean i don't really know
 		i can't i wouldn't i couldn't
