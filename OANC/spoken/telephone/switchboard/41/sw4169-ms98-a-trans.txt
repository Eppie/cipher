 
     		
 	
 		how do you get your current events are you a po couch potato or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well actually no uh it's it's multifaceted for me since i'm married to a news junkie
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		uh yeah we we get the you know about three papers a day plus there's four different newscasts that we watch and of course if there's nothing else um
 		worth doing or watching on television we'll watch either headline news or CNN itself and uh plus i'm a member of a an electronic community and i get a lot of news that way so uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's really pretty hard to not be informed
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well i start out the day listening to the radio on my you know as i'm getting ready for work
 		and in the evenings and and i'm in a vacuum all day except what news i get electronically we have uh electronic news at work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the lunch table discussion usually brings up a few things that people have seen in the paper that morning and i haven't had time to read
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh some more radio on the way home and
 		it's usually too late to watch the news by the time i get home but i can uh read the newspaper then the morning news of course
 	
 	
 		um-hum and of course everything's changed by that time and
 	
 	
 		and
 		oh of course of course and then uh the ten o'clock news at bedtime
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that's about it i don't have cable TV now i used to do like you did and the default was CNN
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and i could just i'd have that thing going for hours
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they really have some fascinating stuff especially on the weekends uh
 		we kind of uh we kind of like CNBC i don't know if you've ever seen it but it's a it's a cable well you don't have cable cable NBC
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and it's sort of like uh National Public Radio on cable television
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so they go into all sorts of neat little off the wall kind of topics that you normally wouldn't get
 		in uh in uh  in a conventional news broadcast or even on CNN it's sort of like socketed little special interest kinds of things and it's really fascinating to see you know they're out there covering it
 		um one thing i wanted to ask you about was the you're you said you're in Dallas the quality of your local papers do you do you see
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		pandering because
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well the the most noticeable thing about our two local papers is that we now have one local paper
 	
 	
 		uh no
 	
 	
 		The The Times Herald went out of business
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it was always the weak sister of the two
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh and the Morning News uh
 		managed somehow to acquire nearly all the comics and features that the Times Herald had been carrying
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i mean they just they just plundered  the poor Times Herald i mean it was financial you can blame the syndicates for going where they're you know they got bigger bucks or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah well see we're a Gannett
 		city
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh the Democrat and Chronicles and Times Union are our papers and a a few years ago they merged editorial boards
 		however they still continue to publish they put out three additions well it's actually DNC puts out two one in the morning And the Times Union puts out two but they're virtually the same paper
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there's an there's an evening edition which comes out at noon and and the late edition which comes out at three
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and just to give you an idea of what i meant by pandering it's like sometimes they their news for the news for the incredible stupid or comatose
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		the past two days the headlines have been massive storm hits area
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's like
 	
 	
 		in case you're brain dead
 	
 	
 		well you know oh well that explains all the snow you know  as if someone was worried about it i just you know i i have to wonder uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh how how well they're serving us because uh
 		you you they've they've got a lock on it they don't there's not that many there's a few alternative newspapers but they all all the alternative newspapers have this sort of an underground feel to them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you you know you really can't trust them they're not i i think i need conservatism from my news i don't know i'm funny
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		just the facts please
 	
 	
 		yeah just the facts and and i don't want really much of a slant on it at all i just want the news
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i don't want uh someone judging the news for me
 	
 	
 		that one of the most famous headlines and i think this was on the editorial page and i don't remember it exactly
 		of the Dallas Morning News was was some story about how well people can read and the fact that they can't and the headline was something like Let's Ban Literacy
 		and wait a minute that sounds fine at first
 		they want to ban illiteracy i think think
 	
 	
 		i think so Let's Ban Literacy but that's going to put you guys out of business don't you think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
