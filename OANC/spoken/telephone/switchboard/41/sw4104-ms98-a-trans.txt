 
     		
 	
 		anyway uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how about you what do you do with your budget
 	
 	
 		what do i do um at the moment it's utter chaos  um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		right now i'm just uh i i don't really have a budget per se i'm i uh
 		it's called living within your means
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know which means at the moment um paying off the Visa bill and keeping everything else under control
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and hoping the car doesn't collapse
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		um but uh no i don't really have a budget at the moment um
 		but i have uh i have uh rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month and then i don't  usually don't exceed that unless i unless the Visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if i have car expenses and then that
 		that then it goes through the moon so
 	
 	
 		yeah that sort of a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah so um
 		what'd you
 	
 	
 		we're trying we're trying
 		to um
 		so far we are in the clear credit wise but uh the other side of it is
 		so
 		not much on that side of it  to add to it we're trying to think of how to put away some savings
 		and stuff like that but
 	
 	
 		so you can afford to get a house
 	
 	
 		yeah we'd like to do that some day we have this dream
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but we don't know how long it will be a dream
 		we we're kind of real we're really happy that we don't have any debt
 		but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this um
 		economy right now so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so what do you and your husband do
 	
 	
 		we're missionaries actually yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		are you really
 	
 	
 		and um it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		and it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home
 	
 	
 		i see so overseas where would you be going
 	
 	
 		so
 		Africa Nigeria
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really how long would you be there
 	
 	
 		about four years we're career so we we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year we go over four we come back for a year
 	
 	
 		with with what church
 	
 	
 		um we're with Wycliffe Bible Translators
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes i uh know who they are they um they have an office uh in in Costa Mesa as i recall
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah they could very well and
 	
 	
 		there there was uh you know there was a fairly large building that that was  so um are you uh are you uh active in translation
 	
 	
 		um we will be i was over over for four years doing language surveying which is the first step you're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		came home and got married and we will go back back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family
 		as translators well i always wanted to do translation
 		but as long as i was single and footloose so to speak it's easier you know they really need surveyors cause you could
 		you're free to travel anywhere you don't have kids hanging around you and stuff
 	
 	
 		true enough so um what uh what languages do you speak besides English of course
 	
 	
 		well i have a smattering of about ten different ones but there's i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other you know since i did
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know complete a survey in one area i'd switch to the other so i know the greetings in about ten
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and how to do market stuff but in about
 		um about five i guess i can do better in it and my French is pretty good but it's uh Senegalese French so uh i'm terrified to speak it in um
 	
 	
 		in France
 	
 	
 		in France yeah because they're real snobby about their language and Senegalese French is street French and
 		i just picked it up off the street and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didn't know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and
 		said something here when i came home and French to somebody and he paled and said i'm not going to tell you what you said so
 		since then i have refrained from speaking any French  except in Senegal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		i don't know what i said to him but uh i didn't ask him either
 	
 	
 		must have been terrible
 		the um
 		was it Henry Macon said that the
 		the uh language is like a is like a man slowly bleeding to death slowly hemorrhaging to death without new infusions that will eventually die
 		and i it it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that free style English is just
 		takes on new
