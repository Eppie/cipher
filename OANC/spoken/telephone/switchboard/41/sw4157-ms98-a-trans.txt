 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		so what do you think
 	
 	
 		um i lived i lived in Sweden for two years and in Sweden they have socialized medicine and so i saw some of the good  and also i saw some of the bad that results from such a program
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so it's a very it's a very uh comfortable i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you know there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected people's lives on in a way that you could see one one thing that i noticed is it's very very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		because it's treated as a disease now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine but
 		uh if you're  if you're alcoholic then you're treated as if you're on disability long-term disability and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		also um another thing that that i noticed that was very strange i was uh i would go down all these uh
 		i remember this one row of houses and they were uh row houses or townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing well it'd be lower middle-class housing here it's probably
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		middle-class housing there um and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these and there was a doctor that lived in one of these the one guy was a doctor and one was a taxi driver and so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		their their incomes were about the same
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		whereas here there's a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward and that that didn't exist in Sweden
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh overall i guess their their health care suffered a fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower and it was it was
 		less professional and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver type job then a then a doctor type job
 	
 	
 		yeah i that is uh that is something i've heard i i had a friend uh that i worked with that was from Sweden and that was
 		uh probably the major the major concern i have is that you know we are leading in the technology realm of
 		of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to to get into uh the medical field but at the same time
 		um it's real hard i mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance and so
 		you know i'm real you know it's like well you know you know there's got to be better ways you know to do some things but you know i hate to
 		uh the the competition in
 		in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor and and uh
 		they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable but at the same time there's a
 		you know they're regulating themselves and and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for
 		my i have a brother who's a vet and for something that he can get you know wholesale and i'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they they hospitals buy in such a bulk rate um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item and that's ridiculous and i don't think that is that is um abnormal in any means to be doing things like that and
 	
 	
 		you don't think it's abnormal
 	
 	
 		i don't think that is that is uh abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all
 	
 	
 		oh i see you're not saying it's right you're just saying it's common
 	
 	
 		it yeah and so it it it's i think i to me i think uh something that's going to help our medical uh arena is for um
 		uh and i don't know how to i don't know how to do this but i think people are too lawsuit happy and i mean things will happen and and you've got to
 		uh keep up or you've got to realize that you know uh it is just men or women that are that are making um decisions and they will make mistakes and
 		
 
 		you know if if people you know uh there are some people that i'm sure make mistakes because they just
 		don't keep on top of it but there are other things that just happen that you can't you know you can't
 		say you know well if you had just done this you know things would have done differently and um
 		i don't know i i think the fact that malpractice has gone up i think has raised our prices just dramatically um
 		in in the in the last number of years and i think that's something that if if they could work on
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		the cause of that and
