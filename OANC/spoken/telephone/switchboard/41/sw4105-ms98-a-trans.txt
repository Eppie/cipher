 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well
 		lets see i i guess i'll i'll mention it i always one of the things i always considered was real important about job benefits i always uh i know they can't do anything about it but i always thought location and quality of life in the region was important towards
 		a a job benefit at least it had a lot to do with what i chose is
 		in in my job and and and besides uh you know uh i guess uh uh salary and uh the work
 		but see those are the things that they can't really do much about
 	
 	
 		that's true unless it's a large corporation that has a lot of different branches uh it was important for me to pick a job uh to choose a job that
 		was in the northeast uh because i like the region and my family is here
 		at one point i'd interviewed for a company that wanted to send me to Boise Idaho and that really seemed like a negative benefit to me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah the uh  i was uh
 		i actually was from the midwest but i uh i always liked the uh concept of going to a warmer client climate uh so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i generally leaned towards the sun belt
 		uh i've worked in uh San Diego and i've worked in Atlanta so you can see that i've moved
 		moved father south since then  uh i used to live in Ohio when i when i was going to school
 		and uh it's still it it becomes a very strong benefit i uh i interviewed with uh companies in uh Baltimore and uh Boston
 		and uh just the the amount of time that it shuts down that that winter shuts you down for activity
 		always used to bother me because i really never got into the winter sports
 		but i like to be very much into the active intramural sports that was important to me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh other job benefited uh job job benefits uh uh i like the idea of uh companies being flexible
 		uh uh with uh time schedules as much as possible i mean i you can't do too much and i understand that
 	
 	
 		i agree with that uh i found though that
 		that uh it it will benefit both the employee and the company i work for a firm that does have a very flexible schedule
 		and i can't remember the last time that i just worked forty hours a week
 		so the uh it it works out that if i have to go in late for a reason or i have to leave early for a reason
 		no one raises an eyebrow but because of that i'm not a clock watcher  if i if i knew they were expecting me there
 		at eight thirty every day and i couldn't leave until five i i think i'd be uh
 		uh have a greater tendency to wait until the clock hit five and then say i'm out of here
 	
 	
 		you're out of there yeah  you then you then you punch in a clock and all you are is an hourly as needed person and then you say well you know why should i give them anymore
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but what they uh if they respect you as a professional you treat them like a professional at that i i i take it then that you are also a professional
 		a salaried employee
 	
 	
 		yeah that's correct that's correct
 	
 	
 		uh it
 		usually they end up getting a lot more hours than i i i uh than the classic forty hours a week sometimes i hate to think about it if i would actually add up hours and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i figure if i were getting time and a half what i was really making per hour
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		oops  but uh well let's see what other i i've always liked i've always liked some vacation i i've i've been fortunate i actually had a
 	
 	
 		
 
 		another
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the company i just just transferred jobs about a week ago
 		so but uh for the last five years i was in a company that had four weeks vacation
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		now that was a real nice benefit it gave me a lot of flexibility
 		uh but of course now i've gone to zero amount of years in the company so now i'm back to the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to the uh original two weeks  that was a tough benefit to give up
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		uh the company i'm working for now starts everyone out at three weeks vacation
 	
 	
 		yeah that is a good benefit
 	
 	
 		and i i thought that was great except during the first year i ended up only being able to take about a week and a half of it
 	
 	
 		right because of the amount of amount of work that you had to be done
 	
 	
 		right i was i was so busy uh
 		and it we've got a very small department and i was just uh wearing so many hats that it was very difficult for me to take time off and when i
 		did take the time off i'd uh get calls from work anyway
 		so it's only been uh in the
