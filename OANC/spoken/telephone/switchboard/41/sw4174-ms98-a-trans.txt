 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay well Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is uh in the situation of choosing college she's actually at Bible College for this current year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i guess uh first and foremost it really it's a question of
 		what
 		the student wants to have in the way of a career and then uh
 		uh which colleges or universities can best offer that program
 		and then it comes down to the dollar you have to uh it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction or you know it does it comes down to uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh what do you feel about come of the things that need to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		damn it i agree with pretty much with everything you've said um
 		the one the one thing that i you know i'd advise any parent um you know or any or any person looking for a college um is that
 		
 
 		i think i think you know it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there
 		because you know they're just um in my experience i've talked to people at other colleges um that you know
 		the the the way the you know the the the lifestyle pictured in the catalogs catalogs isn't always  the whole story
 	
 	
 		no you the the college the the catalogs are sales material it doesn't matter whether  you know they're they're selling school and uh and true it uh really is helpful if a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		parent and the student can get there and see
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school
 		uh i guess there's a difference in here the the
 		at least the university here in Saskatoon is primarily uh off campus resident students like they just live in the community
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you know i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the
 		smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well and that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah i i go to Georgia Tech which is you know primarily an engineering school and uh you know i think i really do miss the fact you know that it's not a university that there's there's not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the the you know it tends to be a very conservative school and there and there doesn't tend to be the diversity of views that a lot of you know universities will will have
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i guess we're here this is the university that has for years had the the car that uh will travel the farthest on uh
 		on a small quantity of gas our engineering students
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh in competitions and that's the kind of thing that also you see uh if you can see the kinds of
 		achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school uh whether you you know in one sense whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know it's sort of
 		somewhat unkind but producing graduates um you know as sort of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some development and some training uh like it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh and that can vary between colleges and faculties even
 		as to how you know what the attitude
 		towards achievement is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		do you uh
 		have anyone that you're seriously needing to uh
 		feed information to i suppose if you're actually at at Georgia Tech as a student you're a ways away from that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i don't really know of anyone that's like looking that's looking for colleges now you know because with the exception of uh people's younger brothers and sisters  then the only advise passed down is don't go to Georgia Tech  uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		no actually actually i'm i'm i'm more interested in in in choosing the right job job when you graduate  type information
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's that's one of the really a valid point that people need to consider as well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know to going to college university is going to take four to eight years depending on
 		the programs programs programs person's involved in and after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself
 	
 	
 		program
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market  jeez the best
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		like a fine arts education i
 	
 	
 		right best training in the world is not going to feed put food on your table
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
