 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		do you live in a high crime area
 	
 	
 		oh it's uh yes and it's the crime mostly in this area is uh burglary house break-ins in fact our car our son's uh car was broken into about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		two weekends ago three weekends ago they stole a stereo i mean it was parked out in front of our house it happened overnight but there's a uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we we had a break at our place our house about three years ago bought an alarm system about within five days after that
 	
 	
 		do you think that that will do it
 	
 	
 		oh i don't think anything is going to be uh foolproof i think it's it's a deterrent i think if they have a choice between our place and one house that's not protected they'll go to the other place
 	
 	
 		they'll go to the  yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh it's uh  we live in uh well i live in Richardson actually you say Arlington do you mean Arlington Texas
 	
 	
 		huh
 		okay
 		yeah Arlington Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and uh the crime out here is mostly of the break in type and vandalism and sort of stuff like that i don't think there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you don't have much street crime
 	
 	
 		no no as far as uh muggings and murders and stuff like that no that's pretty isolated pretty rare i think would knock on wood
 	
 	
 		right
 		um
 		that's what i would think in that area yeah so what do you think you can do to uh
 	
 	
 		yeah but
 		oh you know i think a lot of the crime is committed committed by people that are trying to uh finance their next fix and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's you know that goes back to a drug problem and uh nobody's been able to solve that yet i think it's uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		drug related and then a lot of it starts in the homes and uh the the uh breakup of breakup of the family unit's caused a lot of the problems i mean the dad is gone for one reason or another the mother's raising the kids
 	
 	
 		right
 		family unit you mean
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they just get there's no discipline at the at the home so it just goes from bad to worse it just starts there and leads leads from that into the drug situation and then as i said they're trying to finance their next uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		fix
 	
 	
 		next fix so they're desperate uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and that's what
 		the uh seems like the uh genre of the crime these days is
 		a lot of desperate people whereas i think probably fifty years ago the crime wasn't quite so intense that way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right yeah
 		probably wasn't as personal as it is today i mean break with the uh muggings and the break-ins of the houses and so forth then there there just wasn't as much of it i i imagine as as there is now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		with the
 		uh-huh
 		well i mean i think the reasons were different back then more than they are now like you're saying the drugs can make people really desperate so that makes them also very dangerous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah well i think the courts are to blame i i i just think they're they're overly lenient on these people and i was watching Larry King Live there and they were they were talking about rape and castration and so forth and
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's always so much concern about the uh the rapist and the the burglar and so forth and no concern at all about the victim
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's really disgusting
 	
 	
 		yeah so uh it i think the whole thing just needs a complete overhaul but it starts in the family but it's everybody's to blame i think at least a lot of probably a lot of apathy on the part of people that haven't been uh victimized
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah because they have no idea what it's like
 	
 	
 		right so uh it it it's just a big problem and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there's so many other problems to go around and economy's a problem and i guess at one time Russia was a problem and uh every there there's always one problem or another seems to be uh ahead of the crime problem but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's probably that has to be one of the top two or three
 	
 	
 		well i think for the US i think basically from what i've read that the US has one of the highest crime rates in the world so i think that's a priority
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah you know i think we think we're real sophisticated we're really not when you come right down to it there used to be a lot of stuff on the highways and the roads when you're driving around dropped by people that are
 	
 	
 		we're not
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		that you makes makes you wonder whether they're not just jerks or not i mean they just do crazy thing they they're not breaking the law but they just do some crazy things and
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know it's it's kind of disgusting but they we're really not all that sophisticated over here
 	
 	
 		no if you come down to it if you look at uh the statistics on child abuse
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh violence against women and uh the drug wars and uh also um
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		let's see i think with like with rape it's one out of three women and one out of ten men or boys rape the the amount of rape and uh
 	
 	
 		what's that yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh like with the drugs i think that one solution that i know i hate to say it  but is legalization
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because that's where all the drug the gangs get their power over the drugs because it's illegal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i there's a lot of complications that go along with saying that but i just nothing else seems to be working
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i was going to say it's worth a
