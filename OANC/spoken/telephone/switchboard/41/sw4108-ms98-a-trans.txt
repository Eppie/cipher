 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um
 		so what do you think um about putting an elderly in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh sometimes it is there's no alternative uh you do not have uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh family available or family that's uh you may not even have family that is uh
 		in and who around
 	
 	
 		that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		so sometimes it's not an alternative and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time sometimes in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um especially after if it's after an acute illness to get over a uh or to rehab after uh an illness
 	
 	
 		that's true i never thought of that yeah
 	
 	
 		sometimes you know it sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time
 	
 	
 		that's true until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with
 	
 	
 		um-hum because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to
 	
 	
 		yes they really are they don't like to keep them longer than a week
 	
 	
 		but so so there is some good to it uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job you know the families well the families do not necessarily
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what do you mean
 	
 	
 		uh know what to do with them and they don't wanna take the responsibility so they will put them in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		so you see uh there's both sides to it too what do you think
 	
 	
 		yeah and it depends on how how sick the person is too and what you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah um  i would personally like it if my parents
 		were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help that's not always possible
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		but um
 		to the best of my ability i'd like to do it until it gets impossible
 	
 	
 		well i think that's also where you're gonna to have a lot of people who are going to it's there's not a choice it's because there it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum  yeah
 	
 	
 		so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either Medicare or insurance to cover it
 	
 	
 		that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		but i think nursing homes can be good just depends on what kind they are you know an you need to check them out
 		ahead of time
 	
 	
 		yeah and then there's also some that are set up for specialties uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i know some elderly unfortunately some elderly have to go to or  have
 		i guess it's Alzheimer's or where they wander or or um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		confused or have some mental problems
 	
 	
 		yeah that they're
 	
 	
 		and you need a special nursing home for that you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around and you need people who are trained for that type of problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		and know what they're doing with that
 	
 	
 		yeah so so there's different types of nursing homes i think
 	
 	
 		yeah well my uh grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it
 		and she really liked the idea of of moving there she's not ill yet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years
 		and then she decided that um she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesn't want her family taking care of her
 		and being a burden she's very independent
 		so she's in this nursing home it's out in the country
 		and um she really enjoys it right now
 		because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook
 	
 	
 		gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right some support and then there's also a sort of a wing for those people that do get sick
 		and
 		what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now
 		and then so if she ever does become ill
 		um it'll be like family around her
 	
 	
 		that's right and i i've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah she
 	
 	
 		so it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no she loves it she had a great social life and she travels
 		and um it's in in Missouri in the in the mountains and it's beautiful and uh  i i hope that i have something like that
 		when i get older
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i think of the um
 		i think the the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the uh elderly uh person who's going in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the family that's going to be uh effected effected by it
 	
 	
 		oh definitely it's
 	
 	
 		and uh you know sometimes it can those choices those choices can be made in advance and sometimes the choices uh because of the nature of the illness when they're
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
