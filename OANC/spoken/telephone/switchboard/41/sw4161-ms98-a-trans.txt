 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you keep a budget
 	
 	
 		uh not really all i i just have one commitment and that is that at the end of the month that uh
 		that everything is paid
 		and that's basically my budget
 	
 	
 		that's your budget eh
 	
 	
 		so we use credit cards and uh let's see what else and when i get a
 		when i get a uh a bill in the mail i write a check out for it immediately
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		put a date on the outside of the envelope stick it in my little Franklin Planner
 		and uh
 		i carry it around and then on the day that i'm supposed to mail it why mail it and that way i know how much i'm in the hole
 		so basically  my budget is uh based on
 		
 
 		if uh the bank account's low why we don't spend very much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my uh
 		wife and i
 		we're new young couple starting out so we've been trying to  budget it's getting a lot
 		a lot tighter and we've actually worked out a very extensive year long budget
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so we know exactly what we're gonna spend when and when we're gonna have money and we've worked out a cash flow
 		we just bought a house which is another reason why we're really keeping track of the pennies and that stuff
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and so we have
 		this detailed budget and in some ways it's really kind of nice because there's not much of a worry or not much a discussion or any
 		real conflict over whether we should do this or that or we always have a there's a sense of confidence a little bit because we both know that we're going to have money to do what we said we're going to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		now you have a consensus
 	
 	
 		yeah we as my brother told me when he he's in accounting and he suggested we do this as we were
 	
 	
 		ahead of time huh
 	
 	
 		making these big financial steps and all this stuff and he said well you just do this and you fight once and and that's it once a year and that's it because you've worked out the budget and what you're going to spend
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ah that's very good i've i'm uh i i tried that in the beginning and when when when i say tried it i we tried to sit down there was no consensus
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		uh we both agreed  that uh
 		how shall i say it was the best consensus we could get was uh we're both are pretty thrifty and and uh
 		you know it just we'll just watch our we just won't spend money uh big items we'll  kind of talk to each other about but we have two
 		we're playing uh Russian Roulette i guess although we've been married
 		uh how many years now uh
 		
 
 		let's see
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		twenty six twenty seven years now
 	
 	
 		doesn't sound sounds like you guys have gotten something worked out that's gonna work just fine
 	
 	
 		well it's it what it is it's just a kind of a commitment not to spend too much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh  so
 		the uh but the uh the budget idea sounds pretty good i think if if if we ever
 		had one of these financial crisis you know like a oh
 		an an emergency of some kind a job uh loss or something like that we'd have to  we'd have to do that but neither one of us
 		are predicting what what i do with her is i we have two bank accounts
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		one i i wanted to uh
 		i wanted her to uh to learn how to balance her checkbook because she's
 		she just
 		the the best she can do is is keep it uh current so to speak so what i did was i gave her another checkbook and i said okay you this is your account you can have money anytime you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		want it just tell me how much is in your account
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		she said no you are trying to control me i said i'm not you know you can have six hundred dollars in there if you want another three hundred just tell me
 		and uh so finally we got we have one of these uh things where we get money
 		the company puts makes a direct deposit
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so i give her
 		let's see what  she gets uh like a third of the money for the household and i pay everything else
 	
 	
 		yeah what we've done see we've only been married three years and i
 		my my wife isn't real good with checkbooks and math and all that stuff and so what i did is i just gave it all to her and i said you have to do it everything
 		and then i come in and help her
 	
 	
 		i think that's good
 	
 	
 		and uh that's been really good because it's you know we've both come to appreciate and understand what's going on and she does most everything now and it's really quite nice actually
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i i think that's good one one of my uh friends suggested that
 		that life would be a little easier around our house even yet if i had her do do that because
