 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so uh what are your camping experiences like
 	
 	
 		lately they haven't been much but as a child i used to
 		go camping a lot with my my parents we would uh we lived in Mississippi then and we'd go out and camp for the weekend and fish and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but we camped like in tents not in uh  the mobile home or the
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you roughed it
 	
 	
 		right  that's what i consider really camping
 	
 	
 		basically
 		yeah i the only really camping experiences uh i've had i guess was probably with the Cub Scouts or the Boy Scouts when uh i was younger uh we used i remember one time we went to uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh there's a lake called Lake Lanier here in Georgia that we went to and we camped out on the island and we kind of
 	
 	
 		got familiar with that lake
 	
 	
 		yeah we setup we set up all our you know we we canoed out to some island and uh that was a lot of fun set up because we were all we were isolated from everyone else but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's pretty much
 		i haven't been  lately i have i've i've wanted to lately but there's a i'd like to i need to get some equipment first and i don't really have the money for it now i've i've been looking into like buying uh
 		uh a tent of some sort but they're really expensive like the good ones
 	
 	
 		they are uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's kind of put a cramp in my camping style so late lately i've just kind of for outdoorsy type stuff i've pretty much been you know one day trips where i'll i'll maybe drive up to Alabama somewhere like in a
 		northern Alabama i'm into rock climbing a little bit so so if one of my roommates has some ropes ropes and stuff and sometimes we go up there and
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 	
 	
 		climb around on the rocks and stuff but usually it's a one day affair it's not a overnighter type thing but i'd like to i'd like to really get into that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah well lately about my only halfway experience with camping is we uh
 		my husband races cars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in fact we come to Atlanta for about ten days every year and and that's part of my camping experience is we camp out there a little bit sleep in our van or  what have you for a few nights and um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of cook out of it and what have you but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the last the last true camping experience i had is when uh
 		i drove across country with a friend of mine he lives he goes to school out in California and we drove his car out there and uh we drove you know we took kind of a scenic route we went through uh
 		uh the Grand Canyon and
 	
 	
 		oh sounds nice
 	
 	
 		and uh someone one of us had a tent but not all of us had sleeping bags and it was kind of a it was late summer but it get it got it got really cold at night a lot colder than we thought it would so the sleeping bag was just big enough to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		was just small enough so that it didn't actually cover everyone so it was kind of uh a wrestling match for the  for uh
 		you know warmth so we we we we roughed it until about four in the morning and we were all just freezing so we got up and
 		got in the car and uh drove on we were on a kind of a schedule tight schedule anyway so we couldn't stay too long but we drove on that morning to uh Las Vegas so  i think that was probably my last uh
 		true camping experience
 	
 	
 		yeah well well whenever i mention camping anymore to my husband he says i'm too old for this  he says i i like my luxuries anymore but i think i'd still like to you know do a little camping that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like i say i it brings back memories of my real young years and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he said he'd lived on a farm too long and that was too much like camping anyway true camping
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well this time of year  it's gets really beautiful down the springtime in Georgia with all the dogwoods and
 	
 	
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		there's all kinds of
 		it's real north there's really some real beautiful spots to to hike and stuff in north Georgia you know up in the kind of getting up the mountainous
 		you know the the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i know when the leaves change there too would be a pretty time except you can't really depend on your weather
 	
 	
 		yeah it sure is
 		that's true like today it's it's pouring it it takes the leaves around here i mean it's beautiful when they uh when they change it it seems like it happens so fast that if you don't get there at the right time you're gonna miss everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and the first year we came up there the leaves were changing and since then we've been coming about a week or so too early  but uh i would think that that would be a really nice place for camping
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they're getting
 		they're getting started early this year i'll tell you that much the so the dogwoods are already starting to bloom
 	
 	
 		
  
 		have they oh well that is really nice
 		well i'm sure there are a lot of camping places around here but we get so wrapped up in everyday life we don't get take time to
 		go out and enjoy them um
 		in the spring when the bluebonnets
 		are pretty here i think that's our biggest deal there's just fields of bluebonnets and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that'd be nice
 	
 	
 		what we call Indian paint brushes it's it's really nice
 	
 	
 		i haven't been through that part of the country so i don't really know what i don't really know what it's like over there
 	
 	
 		mostly nothing
