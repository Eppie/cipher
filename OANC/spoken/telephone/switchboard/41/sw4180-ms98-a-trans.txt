 
     		
 	
 		so uh how do you feel about the taxes you pay do you feel you pay uh too much or
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		about right or
 	
 	
 		well it it it's the type of thing of what exactly am i getting out of the taxes and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to some extent there is definitely
 		you know you can say all right i'm paying this money for this and this is what i'm getting back in terms of roads and highways and you know i guess quote unquote retirement if it's actually there when we actually end up retiring
 	
 	
 		yeah it's hard to tell
 	
 	
 		there there seems to be some problem you know some question on whether there will be actually money there or not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that i don't like about the taxes is i was looking through the IRS forms like uh the other day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i noticed that fourteen percent of the amount of money that we pay in for taxes each year is just going to pay the national debt
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		now is that the debt uh  or is that just the interest on the debt
 	
 	
 		that that is the interest on the debt
 	
 	
 		yes you know i really don't understand this completely i've been a little mystified who who are we paying it to
 	
 	
 		ourselves
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um to a large extent i mean one of the i think i'm not sure if it's the largest but i know a large segment of the national debt is um you know things like savings bonds and other government obligations
 	
 	
 		okay so it's to private individuals who own government instruments of some sort
 	
 	
 		well not not just private but there's you know lot of public institutions that are holding money as well as a lot of um foreign companies and foreign persons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that are holding that but
 	
 	
 		okay so but these are nongovernmental entities
 	
 	
 		yeah nongovernmental
 	
 	
 		okay who are holding bonds and whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah you know Treasury Certificates and US Savings Bonds and whatever
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah that is uh i mean well what what can they i mean
 		what's to be done at this point increase that amount for sometime so it will eventually go down or i mean i imagine if you're just servicing the debt you're not really making any progress right
 	
 	
 		right well it's actually uh you know also looking at the same form they had that we are borrowing the US is borrowing eighteen percent of the amount of of how how of whatever it's spending every year
 	
 	
 		so we're increasing the debt by an amount equal to eighteen percent of the annual budget
 	
 	
 		yeah so we're borrowing eighteen percent and fourteen percent of what we're paying out is going to pay the eighteen the uh debt so to some extent we're borrowing money to pay
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you know fourteen percent that we're borrowing goes directly paying out to the debt
 	
 	
 		which is only increasing
 	
 	
 		yeah so we're you know net we're doing a net borrowing of four percent each year and then we're doing a borrowing on top of that of fourteen percent that just goes to pay interest on the debt
 	
 	
 		right and uh
 		then the question i mean do other countries do this or this a distinctly American phenomenon
 	
 	
 		that i don't know i don't know if uh other countries work as a deficit or not i from what i can understand it's only recent within maybe the last fifty years or so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know except for wartimes that the U S has had a peacetime debt
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well and i guess fifty years would pretty much jive with the last big wartime debt
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they just seemed like it's a good idea why stop
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think if you look at some of the uh government spending curves um you know the the curve always went up around wartime and then dropped back down
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		after World War Two it never dropped back down or it was World War Two or uh Korea i think it never dropped back down
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so what do you think is the uh
 		you know if you were in charge what would you
 		what parts would you change to fix this problem
 	
 	
 		well you know definitely one thing is to say hey we have a year to year balanced budget
 	
 	
 		so at least we wouldn't have that additional uh
 		what was it eighteen percent or yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so you know you know maybe raise taxes for a few years until that debt gets paid off and then say you know unless there is a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		tremendously bad circumstances like a war or something we should not be running a deficit economy
 		you know that's i mean if you look on the individual level if i were to borrow eighteen percent of what i was spending every year year after year i would very quickly get in trouble with creditors
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		well it does seem like the uh the quality of the bonds that United States sell would eventually be downgraded doesn't it
 	
 	
 		um yeah well that's you know the post wartime Germany they just kept printing up money and you know it became worthless so that's one danger
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you know it's that that's a very large chunk of
 		the money we pay in for taxes each year
 	
 	
 		it is shocking but apparently no one's willing to
 		oh i'm not no one but by the time it all ends up in Congress seems
