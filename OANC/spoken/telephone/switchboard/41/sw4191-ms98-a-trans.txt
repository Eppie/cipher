 
     		
 	
 		so do you think we have an immigration problem right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it's hard to say there is certainly uh some discussion about that with the uh people trying to come in from Haiti and uh the government wanting to send them back if there is no clear evidence
 		of uh political
 		uh repression
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		the country has set itself for so long as the uh the haven for people
 		from other places uh giving them an opportunity for a new start but  uh was back in the days when there was a lot of
 		a lot of land and a lot of opportunities that uh just don't seem to be available now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i think i think there's still is a lot of land it's just not particularly desirable land yeah i think i think you know the plains were never completely settled
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you know
 		uh you know i'm i'm sure we i'm i'm i'm sure that you know
 		there's plenty of room for room for immigrants in North and South Dakota but i just don't think that most immigrants want to move to North or South Dakota
 	
 	
 		that uh that's true the uh
 		i i think the fact though that there is not a standard uh or or an equitable policy in place is causing a lot of trouble
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh there was a essentially essentially an immigration lottery a few months back
 	
 	
 		yeah i've been hearing about that it seemed like the silliest thing i'd ever heard you know the
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you you can immigrate totally without merit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um
 		because you know you you get the lucky number
 	
 	
 		right
 		and one of the things that uh that everyone was up and arms about was that uh there was a certain preference given to uh to people coming over from Ireland
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and how
 		how a decision like that is made uh oh we don't have enough Irish in this country
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		just just seems to be be fairly strange uh uh either you know oh if we feel that we've been wrong in in keeping the Irish out or whatever it is i i don't understand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how this is all working and i'm not sure the people who are running it understand it either
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i probably agree well what what do you think we could do to make it better
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's that's the hard question that that always seems to be the hard question
 		i don't know that there's
 		there's a lot we can do short of either
 		uh not allowing any immigration whatsoever or opening the flood gates i think that any middle ground is going to uh have its
 		it it it's going to have uh people complaining about discrimination and uh
 		and other problems like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it's interesting to me to see the uh the current administration
 		welcome people from one country and then people who are who are battling to get here from Haiti uh are are rounded up thrown on a military base and shipped back at the earliest possible moment
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		given the fact that uh a democracy was overthrown in Haiti it it's uh
 		contradictory to the the policy of supporting democracy throughout the world that now we want to turn around and send them back because they don't like the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the government the current government that overthrew the democracy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it it it seems
 		you know it seems almost as absurd as a few years ago when um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and we uh you know we'd welcome uh refugees from Nicaragua for political reasons but you know if they're from El Salvador then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		then they couldn't be fleeing to for political reasons because you know we we were friends with that government
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		and i i think that maybe that selectivity is is a bigger problem than just the problem of immigration
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		is that when it is selective like that is fairly visible and people realize that uh oh yes we'll let these people in because uh we we don't like their government
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it it it's an odd situation
 		of course we haven't touched on at all what happens when these people with no visible means of support come to this country without any contacts or any uh
 	
 	
 		were this skills that you know that are really marketable in our country
 	
 	
 		or any
 		right
 	
 	
 		because you know you know of the yeah the the see especially hard to
