 
     		
 	
 		any
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so how do you get most of your news
 	
 	
 		well  i kind of uh
 		i watch the um national news everyday for one i also read one or two papers a day
 		and i'm a i'm pretty much a news junkie and i tune in to CNN a lot
 	
 	
 		oh wow so  when you say the morning news or evening news or  national news is when
 	
 	
 		uh every evening at six thirty i believe i watch the national news
 	
 	
 		oh okay well i would probably be a junkie or something watch CNN a lot but i don't uh
 		i don't uh subscribe to cable because because of the poor service and also uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because well i uh i give to the United Way and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh as opposed to paying for cable
 	
 	
 		yeah i take away a uh a addiction  or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i
 	
 	
 		uh overall i i the quality of the news you get off off of most uh
 		sources i would say is pretty low it's usually you get pretty incomplete coverage and that's one of the reasons where i why i try and get
 		as many sources as possible because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on you would hope it's still you know hard to say that what you've heard is what really is
 	
 	
 		oh
 		what what uh newspapers do you read
 	
 	
 		well i read uh the local newspaper and i also try and read one of the uh major dailies like the Chicago Tribune or the New York Times or something like that
 	
 	
 		uh for a while there i i i uh subscribed to New York Times
 		actually actually a couple of newspapers because uh you know my fiance well she was unemployed for a while so she you know really needed to look at the
 		the want help wanted ads and so often they they try the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspaper of news
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i don't know New York Times is okay but um i don't know when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing is definitely gone down in the last ten years or so but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i mean they they say it's like the sixth grade reading level but i swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes
 	
 	
 		right
 		pretty low
 	
 	
 		but i don't know um i think if if you listen to like NPR or something like
 	
 	
 		right i i really like NPR a lot
 	
 	
 		that's pretty good um and i like listening to that on on uh when i get a chance when i'm in the car a long enough time to to listen to it because i
 	
 	
 		right yeah i miss NPR a lot also i really like them because they give uh instead of being as your newspaper or your
 		TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which i think is good and they also
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		well McNeil Lehrer McNeil and Lehrer i guess he's leaving one of them is leaving
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh they're they're pretty good too um
 		i guess a year ago you're probably watching CNN a lot right had that invasion or whatever it is
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		sure was
 	
 	
 		uh but i i don't know i guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype look at the
 		the Smith trial i mean that was a joke uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that was
 		but then you also have things where you uh where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which i thought was really really good
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the NPR doing that yeah i know the i had uh
 		some visitor and he was just in just i don't know fixated on that you know just listened to it constantly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and i guess that's good when it's live if you if you'll really want that but that's not really providing you news it's it's more like a media event rather than reporting
 	
 	
 		right
 		well but the but the news news
 		news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about C-SPAN which i i tune into every once in a while
 	
 	
 		oh really that's kind of boring to me i think
 	
 	
 		yeah it it is really kind of boring but you know that's
 		if if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned uh report somebody else's view about it and that's what you're supposed you're supposed to
 		if you watch the news you're going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion opinion which i haven't would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i guess that's true but uh one of the ways that i get information is uh everyday when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this this thing it's free inside the company and
 		it's called Intellect and and they basically uh type out abstracts which are really really literally
 		i've i've actually read the actual articles they're pretty good
