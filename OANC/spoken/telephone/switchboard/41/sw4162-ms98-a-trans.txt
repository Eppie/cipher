 
     		
 	
 		well i think um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		for at least for me uh because my sister is looking for day care one of the things that we talked about as being very important is the um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the in the teacher to uh the number of kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because if you've got a lot a large number of children one teacher just won't cut it
 	
 	
 		right even if it's in the home i think this is important even if it's a private home situation
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and not a day care
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um probably number one too would be close references
 		if you know people that have had the experience at they hands on experience of one
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		would be very important
 		word of mouth
 	
 	
 		word of mouth is good uh something that i don't think many people know about and i this is just something i've heard not something i've actually experienced um checked into is that um the agency that uh that license
 	
 	
 		um friends
 	
 	
 		um agencies agencies to care for kids like home either home or day care you can you can request to see if they have had any problems in the past
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		is what i've been told
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that would be a good a good resource to check
 	
 	
 		right right and all of course better business i would check any of your business um  any type of thing references of that type
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		as well as your word of mouth if you were putting them in uh uh school or any day care type you know that's public
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know what i mean like a church or a school type thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i would check that awfully close
 		um i'd go in often
 	
 	
 		yes and in and there's some places i'm sorry go ahead
 	
 	
 		unexpectedly
 		unexpectedly wherever they where
 	
 	
 		right because then there's some places and i would and i would don't this would be a a big minus for the places there are some places that state that you cannot come in unannounced
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you have to have an appointment or you know or whatever and i don't think you know if there hum-um
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		i wouldn't do that i mean i wouldn't not put my child in there though would you
 	
 	
 		no no never
 	
 	
 		you know i would never have a controlled situation not with a little one especially
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know that's not a not a good situation on that
 	
 	
 		and i think you've also got to look you know whenever you go in and you know talk to the talk to the the the teachers and look at the toys that they have and the environment that the kids'll be in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum right that's real important i believe so too to meet the and administrators as well and really kind of
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		research it and get an idea of how they feel about things you know have your questions ready on their feelings on things and all
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		kind of how they basically anyway because they you know that's
 		um seventy percent your child's life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know is developing is there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's real important do you have any children in it yourself
 	
 	
 		no um i like i said my sister's in the process of trying to find one for hers
 	
 	
 		your sister is um-hum
 		yeah it's a scary thing my daughter's been in Houston and had to do it you know just out of the cold she's had to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but she's been real fortunately in finding women in their homes
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		and and that's a good situation but it can it can it can turn bad with older children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i was in a day care until i was thirteen just during like in the summers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and what we found was and what finally got me out of this women's home was the fact that she would go off shopping with some of the older kids and leave me there to care for the little ones
 	
 	
 		oh wow yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and i mean this went on for a summer for a you know good two and a half months
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and it's her daily thing you know and so if you've got older children that you just don't want to leave at home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sometimes a day care a a a private home or a day care setting is not the best
 	
 	
 		not the best situation yeah yeah that's for sure
 	
 	
 		right  right
 		so but oh and another one is is how they discipline
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i know depending a couple of the day cares that that i went to whenever i was younger um one of them disciplined whenever we were outside you hugged a tree and you had time out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		whereas you know i've heard of some agencies you know that get into the physical discipline
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you you really have to find a discipline that that matches your beliefs
 	
 	
 		yes right and what you would want done right yeah
 	
 	
 		or yeah
 		right because it gets it can it can become very confusing for the child
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i would think so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hm
 		what about um
 		well i'm in i'm in nursing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so one thing i would look at would be um
 	
 	
 		the cleanliness and the care health care
 	
 	
 		the cleanliness and the care
 		the health that's right the certification of the of the teachers teachers
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		because there's a new state law mandating that everyone that works in a day care
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		knows knows infant and child CPR
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but there's a lot of places
