 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so is your tax situation pretty straightforward or not straightforward at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah actually actually uh mine's real straightforward um basically uh you know i take my standard deductions um on my house which i have a mortgage on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh that's usually the big the big payoff part of the year for me because i get a couple thousand dollars back usually
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		but uh actually i uh i don't really begrudge uh the uh the government their due
 		i do i do think that uh probably just like just almost anybody else that you know there's a lot of inefficiency in how they distribute taxes
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i don't think that they uh they do a very good job of distributing them to the people who really need them  but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		generally i think they're pretty necessary and life would probably be a lot worse if they didn't have taxation so
 	
 	
 		right i don't have any problem at all with income tax some of the property taxes are well i don't know if they're unfair they're confusing and i there seems to be
 		less
 		ability to get those all together
 	
 	
 		yeah we actually we actually had a situation here where uh our house was appraised you know every year by the county
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we have to uh pay taxes on the basis of what that appraisal was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and first year we owned the house um that appraisal was something like twenty five thousand dollars higher than we had just bought the house for
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and so uh despite you know a lot of kibitzing by our neighbors and stuff i decided to go in to uh talk to the Board of Equalization
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh in Prince William County and make sure that you know a mistake hadn't been made and all that kind of stuff
 		and so i just sort of made my case on the basis of um you know analogy to other to other houses around us that were similar in terms of
 	
 	
 		you just bought it right
 	
 	
 		square footage you know and size all and and you know general property size and things like that and just just showed that you know our obvious for some reason our property had been valued much higher
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh they bought it they actually reduced the uh reduced the appraisal
 	
 	
 		really they didn't raise the they canceled your neighbors' taxes
 	
 	
 		uh they didn't raise my neighbors' yeah they actually reduced mine to be in line with uh a more reasonable appraisal
 	
 	
 		that's really great
 	
 	
 		so i you you know i I realized well the you know few instances you can fight city hall on things like property taxes but uh
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it was an interesting experience because the guy before me went in and he had a really kind of poorly organized discussion you know i mean he was sort of
 		mad at the world and uh he he had sort of that that mad at the world attitude right off the bat which you could you know see a mile away
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then he uh then he started talking about all the things that were wrong with this property you know like you know the leaves hadn't been cleaned out in two years and the gutters are falling off and you know a lot of really minor stuff
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that just didn't impress these guys at all and they sort of gave him a hard time
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh you know when i pointed out that that our house was appraised at this and all these similar houses in the subdivision were appraised at you know twenty five thousand dollars less i mean
 	
 	
 		right and you just bought yours that's the best argument i think
 	
 	
 		yeah so it it it worked it was actually pretty uh pretty satisfying satisfying  experience
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		but it was it was kind of like going up to the Pope though you know i mean they they uh were sitting in these you know at these giant judges tables you know like
 	
 	
 		i bet
 		um-hum
 		oh it was a it was a
 	
 	
 		it was like a judge's chambers that that you
 	
 	
 		really wow it wasn't it wasn't the county council
 	
 	
 		it was the it was the county but it wasn't the council they have different people on this Board of Equalization i don't know i don't even know how they get on it you know i i'm just guessing they're appointed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh one of the guys is actually a kind of a well known realtor around here so you know i I figured if anybody gave me a hard time it'd be him you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right well he did he probably knows it really well the real estate market
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that was probably help
 	
 	
 		but other than that uh i haven't had too much too much problem with taxes actually when i was in grad school i lived in Virginia also i went to school down at uh Charlottesville and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i had a you know one of these graduate fellowships
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and fortunately it was not taxable at that time
 	
 	
 		right now it is
 	
 	
 		but they actually they actually hassled me over it though
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i had to i had to go to some length you know i actually got one of these letters that that said you know you got to show up at the local you know IRS office and explain
 	
 	
 		oh you got audited wow
 	
 	
 		yeah and actually explain you know what was going on and
 		you know  i just i said hey i mean it's tax free i mean that's my understanding of things so anyway eventually they they accepted that that it was but actually work i work with a guy now who's
 		i I i guess he was right
