 		that's  i play the recorder i'm not
 	
 	
 		oh neat
 	
 	
 		and i really love playing with the guitarist and i do it for i used to play the elbow
 		and the recorder has about the same fingerings as the elbow so i just i had to have my elbow back in junior high so i just kept up with that
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but i really enjoy playing that
 		and then the piano
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to teach myself that just to keep myself entertained we just bought an old piano that we are trying to refinish
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so that keeps us really busy
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so do you um practice much in the opera or do you have to go to many practices
 	
 	
 		yeah i have to go to a lot of a lot of rehearsals um

 		now is that volunteer
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it is in that one i played the grandfather of the main character
 		
 
 	
 	
 		huh
 		that's really interesting we never got to go we went to the the orchestra up there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh the Seattle Symphony
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the not the symphony what's the other one
 		there's two groups i can't remember their names
 	
 	
 		well the Seattle Symphony is kind of the main one right here there's some small community orchestras around town
 	
 	
 		what's the one that plays with the U
 	
 	
 		like there's  Harmonic
 	
 	
 		okay that's the one we went and saw
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		so that was that was really interesting too
 		
 
 		are you at work right now
 	
 	
 		no i'm at home
 	
 	
 		oh i heard a
 	
 	
 		it that ringing you heard was a another another line here
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm also uh kind of interested in uh
 		oh uh a lot of kind of ethnic music and foreign music and stuff uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		stuff that's marketed under the name of world music
 		um there's this really great band i found uh that's from Britain called Three Mastabas Three
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		who play this guys i first heard them when i i was visiting a friend in New York a few years ago and he played the tape of them
 		and we couldn't figure out where they were from because they were playing this stuff like some of it sounded like Middle Eastern other sound like it was eastern European and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		anyway it uh uh
 		it was really uh uh really interesting stuff so i came back here to Seattle and found a CD of theirs and was looking for more recordings of their stuff
 		and uh  uh ended up writing a writing them a a  fan letter
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah asking where i could find uh find more uh more of their uh more of their recordings
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		um
 		they uh they wrote back and told me when they were coming to Seattle so i met them when they were here they were were really funny just a moment
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well that was interesting  did you talk to them at all or
 	
 	
 		yeah that was weird i just
 		uh just put my that's weird i just put it on hold and i heard what sounded like a modem on the other line that was calling us up
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's very strange
 	
 	
 		is the group
 	
 	
 		um
 		anyway anyway yeah i met them it was it was kind of interesting i'd been wondering for a long time where these guys were from
 		and thinking they might be from eastern Europe and what they confirmed was our suspicion which was they were basically a bunch of crazed British  no musicologists
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		ooh ah uh uh they were kind of playing a big joke on the world just a second
 		
 
 		
  
 	
 	
 		same thing
 	
 	
 		okay i'm back
 		yeah i never got any instructions with this thing on what you're supposed to do when you get another phone call  how do they deal with call waiting you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh you got you got another phone call from TI
