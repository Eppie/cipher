 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well um i know some in some of the one of the smaller towns around Dallas they started curbside recycling
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's going really well uh because they i think what happened what what goes on is they get like discounts
 		they get charged not by the amount of trash they do well they get charged by for the pick up of the trash and not for the recyclables
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so it's so you get pay you pay less to have your trash picked up because if you presort all out all your trash all your recyclables
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds great
 	
 	
 		what are they doing out there
 	
 	
 		well  it's sort of a mixed bag up here uh
 		some of the communities have started off with volunteer recycling uh one of the towns near here Cambridge uh had a couple years worth of volunteer recycling i never saw it but
 		i know a fellow who was involved in the effort who said that it was amazing just hundreds or you know maybe even more than a thousand cars coming in on the one recycling day a month and they had dozens of volunteers sorting things
 		and when the volume reached a certain level the city's Department of Public Works finally decided to do a curbside program
 	
 	
 		wow
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh my town Arlington
 		has had a uh a similar volunteer program and they just got the Department of Public Works to do a uh
 		a daily drop off at their yard where you know people can bring in glass and
 		and uh paper and and whatnot and aluminum and tin and some of the other towns around here fact just about all the towns that border Arlington where i live have gone to the curbside recycling and
 		i really wish we'd do it here it's just so much easier for people and i think it's it probably results in a larger volume of stuff being recycled if all you have to do is put it out by your curb once a week
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		as it is here i sort of resent the effort to you know collect everything until i have a chance to get down to the DPW yard and drop it off you know it's not a huge inconvenience but it's just one more thing to do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and it's hard to find i know at least here it's hard to find places that will that recycle and so many things are recyclable like shampoo bottles and water bottles
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but no place will take them
 		and you know i mean they're real specific you know you can do your newspapers but you have to take all the slick stuff out
 		you know and well what do you do with the slick stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean they're so specific i mean in i know in Dallas they're having a real hard time right now because the drop off sites
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		people aren't there's a you know what they say that a couple people can mess it up for everybody
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and there's some people that are not sorting out uh like their slick stuff out of their newspapers and uh all their plastic bottles or their brown glass out of their clear glass
 		and the companies that recycle the stuff won't recycle it then
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and they'll just trash it so that all the effort goes downhill
 	
 	
 		boy that's a real problem that
 		really hate to hear that just regarding the newspapers the one curbside thing we do have in my town actually is every other week they'll pick up newspapers
 		which is nice and the rule is that anything that comes in the newspaper even the slick uh ad inserts they'll pick up and that's great
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that is great
 		gee i i didn't i i just thought there was something in the slick stuff that that made it so they couldn't recycle it well that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah i i guess it depends on the facility it's going to the thing that i guess the flip side of that and
 		in our town anyway is that they won't pick up plastics now and even when they were here and in other towns around here they won't take the so called injection molded things which
 		i guess basically are containers that are bigger at the top than at the bottom like yogurt containers typically
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i don't know about Dallas but i think people around Boston eat a lot of yogurt so there's just a lot of lot of containers that uh that wind up getting tossed you know without being recycled
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i don't know what's going on with in terms of capacity it's my impression although i haven't really read anything about it that
 		so many towns and cities have started recycling with there might not be enough firms out there
 		that are willing to take the uh or you know that'll pay decent money to take the materials
 	
 	
 		right right i know well i know here at uh i i'm in i'm in college and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we have more than one campus and i'm on the kind of like an off branch campus
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and on the main campus they've got a company that comes in and takes out all the recyclables all the copy paper and all the cardboard boxes i mean everything that's recyclable
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
