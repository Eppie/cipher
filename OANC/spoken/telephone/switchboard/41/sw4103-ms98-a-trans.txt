 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and a monthly budget the only thing i do now is
 		uh put the data into Quicken i don't know if you're familiar with that
 	
 	
 		yeah i've uh have some friends of mine who use Quicken and uh
 		i considered using it once myself but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 		i i've found that it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife or i'll write a few checks and then we'll uh
 		uh
 		not bother to total it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then it it comes comes in just to do all the arithmetic so it  helps with that
 	
 	
 		yeah well i
 		have similar problems but uh we just have the one check book and we
 		try to keep it up to date as much as possible and occasionally we'll get behind like you say but uh
 		it doesn't really seem to be too too tight if we remember just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well how do you handle the the long range or medium range planning on finances
 	
 	
 		uh actually we haven't had to yet yet uh uh until just recently i guess we've got a
 		a daughter who's eighteen months and another one on the way so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we need to start doing more of that just for uh
 		you know saving for college and things like that
 		we tried a way try to put away between two and four thousand a year just for that for
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's pretty good if you can do that i know
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i have a daughter who's ten and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point but um
 		we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we're gonna be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall and then the money that i'll be making this summer we'll be
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		putting away for her college fund
 	
 	
 		hm
 		sounds good
 		yeah i guess we're we're just at the point my uh
 		my wife worked until we had a family and then you know now we're just going on the one income so it's a lot more interesting trying to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		find some extra i think payroll deductions probably the only way we'll be able to
 		um
 		do it just you know kind of enforce the savings
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh it'll be interesting to see
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently
 		uh
 		took on a full time job well almost full time
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		significant travel and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		that sounds good
 		but uh
 		uh i was just curious what uh part of the country
 		oh
 	
 	
 		ah Wisconsin
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		um Cincinnati actually
 		i was kind of wondering if they'd be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that i don't know how many people
 		are uh going to be involved in this but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well that's interesting i'm uh
 		
 
 		uh um actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading Telecom Digest or was there another
 	
 	
 		uh a colleague of mine at uh at work got some information over
 		um
 		the computer network called internet
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah that's how i got it as well but uh
 	
 	
 		and he just forwarded that on to me and
 		um
 		it sounded like it'd be an interesting project to participate in so i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sent
 	
 	
 		yeah it'll be interesting to see what they
 	
 	
 		sent back some E-mail
 	
 	
 		it'd be interesting to see how the data base  well i guess we're talking about the experiment and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		probably try to get back on the
 		topic but uh it's hard to talk about finances without without
 		getting to uh dollar figures i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know we could talk about some of the long range goals
 	
 	
 		what other long range goals do you have besides college
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 		well i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i guess we'll have to
 		factor that in if we're if we're not working for employers that happen to fund that it seems like every year my employer scales back you know a little bit of their tuition reimbursement
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean they use to reimburse it a hundred percent and now it's uh
 		now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and uh it's it's a real shift from what we had before uh because we're
