 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay an English a Siberian husky and an English springer spaniel
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		sprat
 		Siberian husky and a springer spaniel
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh those are two very different dogs aren't they
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah they are the springer is a little on the small side
 	
 	
 		
  
 		is he kind of hyper too or
 	
 	
 		he's sort of very
 		very hyper
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well this is uh a mutt a mutt of a cat it's a part Siamese it's very vocal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		tabby so um he's orange
 		
  
 	
 	
 		that must be weird to have a howling tabby
 		you know the of course you have the standard Siamese moaning and groaning and
 	
 	
 		you you don't hear it uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i do now
 	
 	
 		it sounds like a baby doesn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah i don't know it's kind of strange it the body shape looks a lot like a Siamese but it's orange
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's uh male he's smaller than most tomcats you see
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah i grew up with two Persians one was eighteen pounds and the other was twenty pounds
 	
 	
 		
  
 		wow
 	
 	
 		serious cats
 	
 	
 		huge
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah you ask permission
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah they have uh extra digits
 	
 	
 		
  
 		no
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		they just were just flat big
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh man i've seen some cats with uh you know extra
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		digit on their paw and things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but uh so why do you have pets
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well we got this uh
 		you know the two dogs one's the Siberian which is a real mellow thing she looks like a wolf but she's just a big baby
 	
 	
 		yeah well why why did you get the the dogs or
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i had dogs all my life
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i've had uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and the Siberian was basically there for the taking if i wanted it as a puppy
 		so i brought the Siberian home and she's just been just great with kids
 		and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then my wife wanted a had a cocker when she was younger and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		when she was a kid and she wanted to have a another spaniel type dog
 		and
 		so we wanted a bigger spaniel because we didn't want a cocker as small as a cocker for the husky to beat up
 	
 	
 		they fight do they fight
 	
 	
 		but the what
 		tooth and nail
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		they're not serious except but they're just always at each other
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how do you know they are not serious
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		uh you mean they're not serious they draw blood or something you mean
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		dogs don't normally fight serious very long because normally one as big as a Siberian or as small as a spaniel the spaniel knows its place pretty quickly and that takes care of that
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 		you know it's normally they're at each other just you know snarling and snapping and rolling and thumbing
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then when they're but when the Siberian's decided that she she's had all that she wants of that hyper spaniel it's it's very clearly stated
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		whack
 	
 	
 		you know there are very clear words spoken in dog and that's the end and the spaniel and the and the springer goes away
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh that's interesting
 		well this is the only cat i mean i i never had cats when i was young
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i had roommates at one point and they had a cat and i lived with that for a couple of years and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and i kind of liked it and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and uh my uh
 		at the time was my girlfriend now my fiancee Kia brought a cat out to me when i was leaving alone down Oregon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		when i was living out there and you know i agreed to have the cat and it was it was good company
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		good company a cat would chest as you fall asleep watching TV or something crazy like that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's why i like them sort of they keep you company and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		they're kind of interesting to watch sometimes
 		this one's very uh playful
 		he's the for unusual unusual for a cat when he was a lot younger
 		he um used to play catch with me and uh i you throw the i catch but i'd throw the ball the whate ver it was and he'd run after it and bring it back
 	
 	
 		uh yeah that's sort of strange for a cat
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		in terms of um you know whatever happens to be around he'll he'll you know play then he also likes going hunting for
 		well insects like uh solar fish or whatever have you it's pretty funny
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		he likes doing that
 	
 	
 		the spaniel is death on crickets
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		really well were in Virginia you live
