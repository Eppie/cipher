 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh have you ever thought about joining the Peace Corps
 	
 	
 		uh for not for any longer than about ten seconds
 	
 	
 		yeah was that was pretty much my thought too
 	
 	
 		no i have no  i have no real desire to do that
 	
 	
 		i i've i've i've actually i've talked to people that uh have have joined the Peace Corps and uh
 		the idea of like you know spending spending like two years in a village in Uganda is you know teaching people how to like you know
 		plow a straight furrow is just not my idea of something i want to do with my life
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i don't doesn't appeal to me either
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		where i work uh there's a guy who actually joined the Peace Corps he worked here for a couple years and then he went to Ghana
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in Africa
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		what did he say about it
 	
 	
 		well he hasn't come back yet
 	
 	
 		oh you mean he he i he did this just recently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah he went just recently
 	
 	
 		i you know i i thought that joining the Peace Corps was something that everybody did like in the sixties you know in
 	
 	
 		well there's yeah but there's actually been a resurgence of people getting into it i guess part partly for economic times
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i don't know any other reason but lot of people are been getting back into it i think
 	
 	
 		i yeah i i i talked to i was talking to somebody uh the other day and they they said i think they went they were in the Peace Corps and they ended up going to like Central America or something and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they ended up in this place where they hadn't seen a white face in like you know seventy five years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh they had to go on the it's like they had typical it it's the typical third world story you know they they had to every every once a week they had to get on the bus and then like drive up into and
 		take drive up into the mountains and stop at each village you know and and have like give lectures on like public health and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know it's like don't piss in the wells  that that type of stuff  and uh he said that they would get on the bus
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's like the children would come up and like touch him because you know they had never seen somebody that light you know a gringo and that it was it was pretty it was really pretty strange
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i it was it would seem to me like if joining the Peace Corps is like you know going to another signing up to go to another planet you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i don't i'm not sure i mean i guess the motivation is partly you want to help these people but i think
 		it's a lot of people join it just to go to another country and kind of for the adventure of it i guess
 	
 	
 		i would really be afraid of i i don't know when i i went to school i i uh
 		i took a course in Parasitology and stuff like that i would really be afraid of like you know of all the diseases and stuff that i could catch and like and man it it seems like a hell of a way to lose weight
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh yeah
 		yeah seems a little rough for that
 	
 	
 		you know  oh i don't know
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		i don't know i kind of you know i don't mind going to Europe you know traveling and seeing the sights but i don't want to  have to go to Africa to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i
 	
 	
 		no the maybe they they'll they'll fly you over there and back for free but doesn't seem worth it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no it it doesn't seem like the kind of job that i i'd really be interested i'm really interested in either
 	
 	
 		what type of work do you do now
 	
 	
 		oh i'm a i'm an engineer yeah
 	
 	
 		okay for who do you work for you work for
 	
 	
 		uh uh Lockheed
 	
 	
 		oh really i didn't know they had an office up there
 	
 	
 		yeah uh we uh they have a we work for some uh Lockheed Sanders we we don't build the aircraft per se we work on the uh like the avionics yeah we work we put the
 	
 	
 		Sanders avionics
 		okay yeah i've heard of Sanders Corporation were they bought out by Lockheed and all of that okay
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they they were bought out by Lockheed and it's a they were they were involved like in in radars and thing and uh and things like that
 	
 	
 		right that's that's kind of the work that i do so that's why i've heard of Sanders i work for i work for Georgia Tech
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh who do you work for
 		oh okay uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in research
 	
 	
 		yeah we it it's it's not bad it's not bad work although i'll tell you it's like
 		uh i being in the defense industry is not is not really the thing to to be in right now
 	
 	
 		right that's right
 	
 	
 		it it's sort of like being in steel like ten years ago
 	
 	
 		yeah you're just kind of biding your time
 	
 	
 		right you you know that uh  i was just talking to somebody about this the other day is that uh i
 		i haven't seen a a a new hire uh somebody you know just fresh out of college brought into the company in like a year and a half
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh what's happening is that you know we're just like kind of getting grayer and grayer and grayer you know the the there's no growth here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah it we're essentially the same although some some laboratories are hiring if if they can find new technology uh you know or make an efforts to get into the commercial markets
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we're kind of getting smaller through attrition but there in some cases we're hiring also
 	
 	
 		yeah  this the this attrition thing though i that that that's like death itself in my mind
