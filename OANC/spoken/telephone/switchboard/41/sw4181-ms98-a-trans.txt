 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't think anybody pays too little
 	
 	
 		no i would tend to agree very highly i think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it
 	
 	
 		do you get hit up for local taxes there
 	
 	
 		yeah we sure do here in Indiana we pay uh
 		we pay county income tax state income tax we pay five percent sales tax uh you name it they tax it
 	
 	
 		oh so you you you get the whole smorgasbord
 	
 	
 		that's right we
 	
 	
 		well i i actually live in New Hampshire
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		tax free or die uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right which is probably pretty nice but i'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high
 	
 	
 		no actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either
 	
 	
 		there's no sales tax either
 	
 	
 		no what there is is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the only problem is i work in Massachusetts so they they hit me up for the five percent there
 	
 	
 		right
 		Taxachusetts
 	
 	
 		yep but it well you know we it's it's only a state taxes no local we've got a five percent sales tax
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um the problem is that so i'm paying state tax even though i don't live here but at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's not too bad
 	
 	
 		no i uh i really think that here in Indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax i worked in a factory uh
 		last summer and on the average i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes
 		and i don't feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that i mean i don't utilize all you know it really any government welfare services of course i drive on the roads and i you know went to the schools and stuff but i really feel that
 		that i'm just getting overtaxed
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i i i mean i i'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on i mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know i actually hit the thirty one bracket this year which was no fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no that's that's not any fun
 	
 	
 		right and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for FICA
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is taxes where you  most people forget about them because you've got you know you can't always get your FICA back at the end of the year but so you know and then you know like a five percent FICA i'm paying forty percent tax
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		yeah which is just outrageous and a lot of it and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of its going to waste
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i mean i think there's some people there you there clearly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		than you're gonna get out of private individuals but
 		you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way or
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right got to keep those farmers happy
 	
 	
 		you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		into into programs that you know yeah they are they are fat you know i think the military is really fat i think that a lot of the the HEW services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them
 	
 	
 		right there is there is just way too much bureaucracy and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs
 	
 	
 		you know like we we
 		um
 		yeah i mean we we spend a fortune for things like VA hospitals
 		and you know then you look at how well they're managed you know i don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there i think it's all going into into bureaucrats
 	
 	
 		right
 		and a lot of it's feeding uh just i just i really especially in the election year i mean i'm really thinking a lot about this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy of the government goes and our our whole economy in general and our taxes just are gonna keep rising no matter what happens and especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government and expenditures
 		uh beyond beyond what any other President since World War Two has done and yet he supposedly
 	
 	
 		well between between between him and Reagan yeah
 	
 	
 		right right yeah i mean i just read something that two thirds or three quarters i'm not exactly sure of our national debt
 	
 	
 		the great communicator
 	
 	
 		are was created during the Reagan Bush era who are supposedly supposedly fiscally conservative
 	
 	
 		oh oh yeah they think
 		oh yeah and then they go and say that Congress Congress they're the fault for it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but you know the other thing is it's tricky though because like in New Hampshire they say oh all right let's cut the military budget well yeah then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire you lose Grotten Connecticut goes so you know it's like
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know if the if the if people lose their jobs then they become a load and they're not contributing taxes
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so you know it's it's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really that is the especially that defense  cuts in the defense is really a catch-22
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great that's gonna lower our national expenditures but then you're gonna have people on welfare and they're not putting taxes in
 	
 	
 		who who aren't contributing right yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's that's really
 	
 	
 		and uh in our
 	
 	
 		it's i'm glad i'm not the one who has to come up with these policies
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		but what's very funny is in our town meeting
 		they were voting this this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution  for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		they say i want to pay for this and this and this and this and this
 		course the only problem with that is then nobody pays for the necessary services that they don't use
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah
