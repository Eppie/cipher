 		this is for everybody for for private and commercial sector uh my feelings are is that i i don't really think that they should test for drugs that you if you gonna take a job
 		you know and then they say well we're we're gonna
 		we're gonna test you you know periodically or something like this because the job is of the security nature or for the you know and the public safety or something that's might be one thing but i really believe that the employee
 		should have the right of of before he takes a job of making that decision there's just uh
 		there's too many false positives and your your your privacy is is just taken away from you just you don't really have
 		a
 		a recourse if they say well it's it's do you have a positive you know and you say well no that's not really true and they say well okay well here
 		you have to go and and here you go pee in the bottle and and we get somebody and we can watch you pee in the bottle and we'll see if if if if if if it what happens this time and they they just  that the testing part part of it is just really bad
 	
 	
 		is i didn't i didn't really i don't really know much about this are i didn't realize that false positives were such a risk
 	
 	
 		yeah they are they are they it's  one of the reason is because of the cost
 		and when you have such a magnitude of people and you have a company and you're trying to  you're trying to stay afloat and you're you're you're you're having to get these tests and these tests are very expensive so what happens is that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		sometimes you get so you're getting through a a testing company that's that's we would might say just for
 		terms is fly a fly by night company something like
