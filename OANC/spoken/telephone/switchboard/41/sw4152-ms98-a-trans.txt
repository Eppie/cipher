 
     		
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		anyway i uh
 		i uh oh i i did forget to ask you what is your name by the way
 	
 	
 		um i'm Ann
 	
 	
 		oh you're Ann hi
 		but um
 		anyway i uh lot of lot of stuff interesting procedural things i think we could we could change if we're going to
 		talking about the subject tonight tonight which is some i guess criminal courts the
 	
 	
 		criminal courts yes
 	
 	
 		yeah the  the one of which was uh
 		something something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race
 		uh yeah yeah well the the uh the the people that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		the the the uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel and there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact
 	
 	
 		right
 		how is it i can't i'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one
 	
 	
 		they have they have they moved it up to the county north of here
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um it's in Ventura and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that
 	
 	
 		well that videotape was just horrible
 	
 	
 		yeah it was everywhere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you know and i i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on
 	
 	
 		oh i agree with you but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or
 		you know uh appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		exactly you know um the
 		you know i i'm kind of torn on this issue it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true
 		but on the other hand is it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know they're not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		based on fact right
 		how interesting ooh
 		so what's the prevailing thought within the community
 	
 	
 		i um
 	
 	
 		i mean you know what the news media's gonna make of it but what about the community
 	
 	
 		they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i haven't talked to uh i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i i rather imagine there's  there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic
 		oh here we go again folks kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh my goodness that can't be good for Los Angeles either
 	
 	
 		no no i you know on on on one hand you on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's they they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy
 	
 	
 		oh exactly
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		unfortunately that kind of thing is not
 		limited to
 		uh a big city like Los Angeles you're going to have it
 		just about anywhere
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there but that's that's interesting
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		what about the judge who's hearing the case is he gonna be impartial is he going to be a good a good adjudicator
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't know you know and and again there's something else that you know there was a
 		uh it something else along those lines there was a girl
 		out here named Latausha Harlins i don't know if this this got this got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the Rodney King problem um
 		girl walked into a Korean owned store  and uh they she had a dispute black girl
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store the owner of the store popped her
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and and well of course the you know the criminal case went up and  and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh
 		uh practically a suspended sentence i mean it was
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		it was just she gave her no time in jail and and you know all of these things and then oh there's uh we have these we have people wandering around to with petitions trying to get the judge
 	
 	
 		to get that judge recalled i would think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		hm that's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized standardized sentences
 	
 	
 		yeah it would make it would make life easier yeah but
 	
 	
 		it would uh you would know the whole world would know what you were facing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then it's a matter of of deciding guilt
