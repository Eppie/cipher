 
     		
 	
 		okay supposedly we're recording right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh it's kind of interesting because nearly thirty minutes ago i was reading an advertisement for the new Infinity i forget what model number it was but one of the features they were touting was a freon free air conditioning system
 	
 	
 		that's interesting i hadn't seen that i know there was a lot of talk about freon contributing to the
 		the uh hole in the ozone layer and other various pollution but uh other than
 		uh making the air conditioning systems tighter i didn't know that there was any work on uh alternate coolants
 	
 	
 		yeah this is the first i'd seen of it too um actually i was kind of i'm surprised kind of surprised that that
 		has become as much of an issue as it has because you know we know these things are designed to be closed systems either whether the problem's due to leaks or due to failures i would think that um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah if it was designed with reasonable prudence stuff wouldn't get loose and um i mean you don't want it to it's not cheap and the thing fails when it does
 		so i'm kind of surprised it became as much of an issue as it has
 	
 	
 		the uh the the times that i've seen any sort of of loss is uh
 		at a time when maybe i'd have uh the the uh freon checked in the air conditioner or maybe topped off
 		and it seemed to me that they'd practically waste almost as much as uh they'd put in the car but i've noticed in the past few years that uh the controls on that are
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		tighter uh people are a lot more concerned about that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		so what what do you what do you see as the other biggies being in that realm you know what else could be something that is a bad thing
 	
 	
 		well obviously cars uh and trucks contribute quite a bit
 		and personally i'll uh i carpool uh most of the time with someone i work with but my schedule doesn't uh
 		doesn't make for a consistent carpool
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i um traded cars recently and went from a car that got seventeen miles per gallon
 		of worth of on on premium and didn't really wasn't happy with premium wasn't high enough
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to a car that gets about twenty four miles per gallon on uh the cheapest garbage you can put in it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i probably contributed my share there and um kind of interesting course um there is talk about legislation that would ban
 		the manufacture of an engine that required leaded fuel at some point and um
 		this i believe has i read has put the general aviation uh world going nuts because
 		a general aviation engine can cost in the neighborhood of thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars to overhaul and if it flies a hundred hours a year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's moderately high so the amount of dollars spent per unit of pollution saved
 		um are very very tiny as compared to a car where it's a relatively inexpensive engine and it's running for a lot longer per year
 		um so it's a question of um now apparently uh the EPA thought about this again and decided that
 		these that that general aviation engines won't count
 		and they'll allow them to continue to burn leaded fuels but there's some concern over if this is the only market is anybody gonna wanna bother making leaded fuels
 	
 	
 		that's a that's a good question uh the leaded fuels have obviously been out of the automotive industry for quite some time and there's always talk about uh
 		about regulating the emissions that a a car engine can produce and tightening down on that and of course the uh
 		the large auto makers in this country spend untold millions to lobby to keep business just the same as usual
 	
 	
 		it's an old joke about the uh finest Congressman money can buy
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		sounds like another issue um
 		you know i've always viewed it as um the pollution issue as a property rights issue if um somebody dumped their garbage in your front lawn
 		um regularly
 		you'd have legal recourse but if he dumps it into the air surrounding your house you really don't have any
 		and um i think therein lies a big part of the problem is that it's it's viewed a little differently from physical pollution
 	
 	
 		there's a big issue in Rhode Island right now uh there's a company that wants to build a coal fired uh energy plant very close to to downtown Providence
 		and they are pulling all sorts of tricks to maneuver around various controls and inspections and regulations apparently the
 		the regulations
