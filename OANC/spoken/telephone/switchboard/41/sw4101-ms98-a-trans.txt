 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i'm starting to split stuff split split stuff off the only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb they make me drive it like a mile down the road and split it out down there what are they doing up there
 	
 	
 		well here in Saskatoon um  much the same thing there is no curb pick up of uh
 		any of the recycled products uh we're in a community of about a hundred and eighty thousand people  uh  there are areas where we could uh  actually we have a couple of the uh
 		handicapped societies type of places where they uh
 		one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they uh collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so uh we're able to uh
 		have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are
 		there's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers well primarily soft drink bottles and so we're able to uh  take it to one of the uh
 		rehabilitation centers and then they recycle the containers  they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container and then
 	
 	
 		but the deposits only on like drink stuff
 	
 	
 		right yeah on the on primarily on soft drink pop and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers uh we do have
 		one one of the scrap metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum  cans as well
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those so
 		uh it's fairly fairly extensive but again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city
 	
 	
 		so is they you're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group and the handicapped group is getting the uh the money
 		or or you got or they somehow distributing the funds back to you
 	
 	
 		well actually there's
 		there's the opportunity for both
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		generally the uh
 		the handicapped group takes care of the things that actually the government has placed a deposit which is the inducement to recycle recycle the bottle so that you get your money back
 		and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit
 		and then i have a then then they in turn will get  some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well
 	
 	
 		that's very cool you know there's a i i heard about a a similar program in New York City where uh i think it's called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that but what they do is employ um homeless i think mostly men but homeless people
 		to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans and and i think it's mostly cans there may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not and they uh bring them up to a one
 		location one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and uh and and get more money to these people that desperately need it
 	
 	
 		um yeah  um i guess partly because of our climate here in Saskatoon at least the majority of
 		Central Canada uh well i want to say Central Canada but Central Canada tends to be referred more to Ontario and Quebec
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but um
 		we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfor welfare and unemployment insurance that kind of thing  um
 		there's psychological pressure against
 		employing people to do that kind of thing although um
 		scouts and
 		hockey teams and ball teams those kinds um regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collecting the bottles at individual homes
 	
 	
 		do they do it with newspapers as well
 	
 	
 		they have done it some
 		um but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting uh newspapers they're actually at
 		virtually all of the shopping centers like the shopping malls there are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries
 		collects or people can drop their used newspapers and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um some of the
