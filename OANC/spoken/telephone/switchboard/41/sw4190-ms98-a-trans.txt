 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well the health care
 		several of the candidates i think in particular i think it was Senator Carey wanted to do national health care we're we're in  we're in a disaster we need we need some
 		sort of health care that's available to everybody and the prices just seem to be really escalating the price of medication is is so exuberant
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that uh a lot of people just can't afford it and insurance is is so expensive
 	
 	
 		well uh even even for older residents senior citizens the Medicare and Medicaid does not cover enough of what they need
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and social security as far as helping them in their retirement is not going to be adequate by the time we're
 		ready for it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and doctor doctor visits medicine hospitalization
 		if they increase at the rate they are now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there's not going to be anybody that can afford it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well you know i just
 		i don't have
 		i'm an older student but i'm going i went back to school and like i'm just finishing up but so my finances are kind of shaky at times and i can't afford dental insurance
 		and
 		i had to have to have a tooth extracted and i had to pay cash for it
 		and i asked the dentist how come you know the price is so high i said i said i i thought because you know the prices of medication you know like it costs them ten cents to to make a pill and they charge you two dollars and
 		he said one of the reasons is the litigation for um claims against the doctors so they lawyers have got their their fingers fingers in the pie too
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that's it's sort of like trickling down for the overall cost
 		and the the doctors
 		have
 		um
 		
 
 		might say a production line and just like i i said well how much is it going to cost he goes well it'll cost you
 		um seventy dollars he no he says it'll cost you seventy dollars and then i require an x-ray okay
 		and so it'll cost you a hundred and two dollars well
 		i knew which tooth it was and he knew it was too and all i needed was extract it but he wanted he wanted to make the money so they're they're they're taught that people should have certain services whether regardless of whether they need them or not
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		and they're making it
 		almost impossible for people to go and get well routine care shall we say insurance now won't cover uh wellness visits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or uh children baby visits your insurance won't cover that anymore
 	
 	
 		but
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i thought well does it pay for you to be a fit well individual when your insurance doesn't even cover things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the thing is just like dental hospitalization and dental it's unbelievable
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i haven't
 	
 	
 		you can go to the hospital and you'll pay four dollars for a aspirin
 	
 	
 		i haven't been in the the job market for
 		oh three or four years i mean i i've worked and things but i haven't really had you might say a full-time job health coverage and things like that but i've uh done you know i've done readings and and things
 		and in fact i was watching on the TV
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is that if you work for a small company just say maybe thirty to forty employees and you have they're insured and your employees are sure are insured under what's called the group plan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well if one or two of the people in that group
 		happened to have a chronic illness where it it you need they need care all the time like say they had a child that that needed uh a lung machine and a respirator and a nurse to come in and things like this
 		well what they would do is they would just cancel everybody's insurance and say we're not going to cover you and then the employees are out uh health insurance
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		our our group medical plan has increased every year in the past three years uh i work for Edward D Jones stockbrokerage
 	
 	
 		where do you work
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's just every year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		every year is just a little bit more of course our you our cost um aren't hardly anything compared to people that have to go out and get their own because of the group plan but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		it is the costs have increased every year
 	
 	
 		then plus the coverages they they decrease so you they don't want you to see the the the deductibles increase too
 	
 	
 		um-hum exactly
 		we did start a plan this year there's an insurance company through Metropolitan Life that has started a flexible plan
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and with that they will take out pre tax dollars
 		and build it up and it will cover things that your regular insurance won't eyeglasses uh dentist visits
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh wellness care prescriptions that are not covered through your insurance and that's the first time i have seen any
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		effort effort at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to make a change in the
