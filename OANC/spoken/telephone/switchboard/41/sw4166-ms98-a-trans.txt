 
     		
 	
 		okay uh before a couple of years ago i had a a very narrow view of of nursing homes and it was uh more like a funeral home i always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh then i had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler Texas and i went to one and it just had a very good activities director everyone was cheerful
 		and now i don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore but i i certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was
 		an absolute last resort resort um i have a sister that is in nursing school and she's real interested in geriatrics
 	
 	
 		well that sounds good
 	
 	
 		yeah so uh she she's real interested in uh what Ann Richards has been doing she's Ann Richards is really cracking down on uh the nursing homes and
 		i don't know you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor
 	
 	
 		i've heard the name and that's about all it goes
 	
 	
 		okay Ann Richards is our governor in Texas and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes and uh my sister's real interested in that and and getting into the to that side of nursing
 	
 	
 		yeah that's one problem with the the nursing home environment it the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um you know they don't always have their full wits about them they're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it can be pretty sad i've
 		got a had a grandmother who had a stroke and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you know it's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida my  families was up in Maryland
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the other part of her family was up in uh New York state
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know it was very difficult for either of them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was
 		um you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know the nursing home was the
 		you know best facility to put her in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my uh aunts and uncle work
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		which means it's you know very difficult for someone you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and you know there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in home
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		which makes it you know it's a necessary evil i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum it sure is and some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive
 		because because they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and you know even there you have to watch out for you know you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes
 	
 	
 		right my grandfather passed away several years ago i was much younger but um he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life
 		and someone visited him everyday my grandmother did but uh if she couldn't someone visited him every day it was in a very small town nursing home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh people didn't get paid much there at all they didn't care about what went on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they would let a let a patient get a lot of bed sores
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh the the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people and
 		then the nurses and doctors really didn't put any forth forth any loving care for them
 	
 	
 		either that or they're just so understaffed that they uh can't afford to put in the uh care that they need
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		because it's you know an elderly person can
 		you know it's like a newborn baby you need to have twenty four hour care
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh answering all the needs because they can't do much for themselves at certain points
 	
 	
 		right and the nurses get so worn down
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and you know there's a lot of number of the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can
 	
 	
 		oh sure and they feel
 	
 	
 		and it very very hard for them to accept that
 	
 	
 		they feel pretty helpless
 	
 	
 		we just uh moved my grandfather into
 		not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility
 	
 	
 		is it uh like a retirement center
 	
 	
 		more of a retirement home he's got his own efficiency apartment and they provide one meal a day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him but they do have you know group activities going on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		how's he handling that
 	
 	
 		uh he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's it's a bit of a shock to the system weatherwise if nothing else
 	
 	
 		oh sure there wasn't anything like that that you could do in Florida
 	
 	
 		well there was stuff like that in Florida but
