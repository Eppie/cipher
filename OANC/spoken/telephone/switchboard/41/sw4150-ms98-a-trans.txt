 
     		
 	
 		right okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		how many kids do you have
 	
 	
 		i think we i think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children we have three children who are eleven nine and eight
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so this is a big issue with us although i don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but  perhaps they are looking for uh words to be said like day care and quality time and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		anyway  you don't have children
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		but you're married
 	
 	
 		yeah we we been married for two and a half years we've been trying for about two years but no luck yet  hopefully
 	
 	
 		oh
 		you know i know we're not supposed to do this long distance but actually i'm getting a call i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting could i ask you to hold one minute i'll be right back excuse me just a moment they're gonna get mad
 	
 	
 		uh-huh had
 		
 
 		she has three kids eleven nine and eight
 	
 	
 		hello i'm so sorry that was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it's all right
 		okay so it keeps you busy do you have a lot of activities with your kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i don't wanna i don't want this to be a unilateral conversation but  yes we do both my husband and i work and our children are sixth fourth and third grade
 		and the school years are wonderful they're just wonderful the kids they're real people and they're interesting and  they they have all their own activities and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think as parents we really enjoy them and in our own personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel  i'm sure i'm sure that's coming though but they're wonderful kids
 	
 	
 		uh-huh so they're pretty good kids huh
 		yeah
 		well we had nine well growing up i guess i can talk about us uh we had nine kids in our family we had eight boys and one girl
 		but my dad um  yeah and the time that my we spent with our dad was he owned his own business so we worked with him most of the time
 	
 	
 		you had eight boys and one girl
 	
 	
 		so that's how we spent most of the time with him yeah
 	
 	
 		are you Mormons
 		because with Utah and the large family
 	
 	
 		that was the dead giveaway huh
 	
 	
 		well we're Catholics i came from a family of five i had four brothers the only girl
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled
 		i never felt spoiled in fact i always felt my toys were destroyed
 	
 	
 		which that
 		i was gonna say my sister wasn't spoiled very much
 	
 	
 		no usually busy fighting for survival
 	
 	
 		yeah that's exactly what it was
 	
 	
 		well i do think with working parents it is i mean there are some real issues here um
 	
 	
 		but
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that i think um
 		i don't know it's an interesting phenomena i happen to um  i'm a pediatrician my husband is a physician so um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i i teasingly i talk to parents about this a lot uh children i i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home
 		um need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home i really believe that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it has um
 		helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age and i think our kids are real secure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it's
 		i really think it's true for our family and i think it has worked very well
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah it's like you said it's you know to each his own i mean we're planning on having my wife stay home and but
 	
 	
 		there's no question i think that's really the best if if a woman is happy doing that i hate to put it quite that way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i was twenty nine when i had my first child and um i would not have
 		been real fulfilled i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child it's a wonderful it's wonderful to be a mother but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i liked i like the way i did it i sort of worked half time i had very flexible hours
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i nursed all three of our children till they were at least a year and i you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		and i think we choose very very carefully the um alternative situations that we had them in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		some babysitting groups again i know it sounds like a rationalization but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they  they learn to share
 		and they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they're secure  i think that helps
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's good sounds like you're have a handle on it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah hope so so your wife does she work right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um no not right now right  right well we just moved down here we used to live up in Seattle
 	
 	
 		she's out
 	
 	
 		for for a couple years
 	
 	
 		so you're still trying to dry out
 	
 	
 		it's  it's no problem here  yeah we really liked it up there but then when
