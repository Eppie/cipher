 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i don't know um does your do you have recycling in Atlanta
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i see  seen some uh there's some trucks that come around kind of like garbage trucks they have like four different big containers on them and they'll go and uh
 		and collect collect it but i think the i think it's pretty expensive to do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you have to do you have to do the sorting or do they do the sorting for you
 	
 	
 		well from i can tell what i've seen of it they have different color containers and uh you sort of sort it out uh
 		in your home and then put it out on the curb and they and they just throw the matching color uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum into the different box
 	
 	
 		container yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah  up here like New Hampshire doesn't uh well where i am uh we don't have any recycling we don't even have a bottle bill or anything like that and that's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's not real
 		that's not real popular with the states around us because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the the extra nickel or what is it extra thirty cents for a for a for six bottles everybody everybody comes across the border  to buy the cheaper the the cheaper drinks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		i i i i think that well i do some recycling like i save my my bottles and things like that but i don't think i do as as much i think i could do more
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i
 		there's a big problem here with like landfills
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh like
 		they the the landfills are just are just like filling up with stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think that if if they were to recycle if i were to i guess if if there was like some kind of a program i would do it because just so that we could save the space in those things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh it's kind of funny i saw um a special on a public public broadcasting station down here and uh they were talking about recycling and
 		they they uh i i forgot exactly where this was but
 		they were showing just piles and piles of plastic and glass that uh was at a recycling center but it was costing them uh
 		about forty dollars a ton to recycle and they could only get about ten dollars a ton for it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so  so you know there was just uh no nothing in it for them
 	
 	
 		i i was
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i i don't know when i was in when i i was  last year i went to a class and and uh we would we they they brought it this guy that uh that made
 		let's see he made he made a lot of money working because because like in in the states like Massachusetts and Vermont and all the states around New Hampshire they put in this bottle bill do you have a bottle bill down there
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure i
 	
 	
 		that's where it's like every every every every can is stamped with like a a nickel return on it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's like you you have to like if you can turn the can in to to any store and they have to pay you a nickel for it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but what happens is that then all these cans come running you know some stores get more cans than they sell and they have a big problem with that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the law says that if they sell they have to collect
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but anyway this guy like all the like the beer distributors were having like the biggest problem and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he
 		he he actually like made a business that just went around from like distributor to distributor
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		collecting like all the cans and he said like some things like the aluminum cans
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they they could make money on because aluminum can be they can just throw that back into the pot
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that just gets melted back up and that's not a problem but um like the plastic ones you said like you were saying
 		they they lost like big money on because they can't recycle they can't reuse the some plastics can be reused but most plastics can't be remelded remolded or melted melted into into other things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it just becomes more of a pain than it's worth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't know i i wonder you know should
 		should they be making things that like just can't be reused
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it kind of i i don't i don't and well
 		should i be buying things that can't be reused
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's uh
 		uh
 		something i think about a lot too is you know when you're buying
 		everything is you know if it's not convenient people don't want it
 		and usually convenience means waste
 	
 	
 		i
 		yeah well you know  i i can't something i can't figure out is it
 		do you every do you every did you ever see those big old Coke bottles you know the glass ones that were like they were kind of green
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		at at what point in time did it get to be
 		at what you know i didn't i thought they were great but at what point in time did it get to be worse
 	
 	
 		yeah
