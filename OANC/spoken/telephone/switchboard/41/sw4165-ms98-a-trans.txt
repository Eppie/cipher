 		like i mentioned Brian and i guess we're going to want to be talking about child care uh do you have any experience in uh finding child care
 	
 	
 		well ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care our kids are now fourteen and eighteen but uh  and so you know you go back
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		those many years and uh we didn't do it very much we i guess we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at uh two family income at the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and our kids were older but i've had to deal with uh you know friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh so it my involvement hasn't been direct but still have been you know certainly exposed to criteria people are using how about yourself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well uh we're kind of lucky i i'm uh
 		i'm working my wife isn't working and she is taking care of the kids also and and so we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice but i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of uh coworkers and associates that are looking
 		for child care and some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care uh what kind of you know
 		uh guidance counselor to student or you know
 		uh adult to child relationship how many you know you don't want to have thirty or forty  kids and only one adult
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		then uh something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to uh accommodate or take care of the kids very well and uh
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time so you know depends also upon the the level of the child we uh
 		we uh take a very close look at finding a a preschool a good preschool for our kid and i kind of relate that to that in in making sure that the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the uh teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them and it's very important i feel
 		uh that the kids interact with other children also it's a it's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and uh get to know and work with kids
 		so i don't know i i guess we're kind of in the same boat we haven't had to look very carefully for child care
 	
 	
 		yeah i  i kind of think that uh
 		you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care but even you know here i guess we have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in one sense two forms of uh child care there's where individuals will
 		in one primarily babysit children in their own home and that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to maybe seven or eight children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then otherwise there will be  the majority are cooperative day cares uh people form a co-op and uh parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		frequently they will hire staff to be at the day care and
 		the emphasis is primarily uh someplace for the children to be but at the same time there's some fairly good training programs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and some of them formal two year programs
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh so that you know there is some definite uh creative play good social interaction that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		i think it's uh important like you mentioned that's a good idea on the uh parent co-op because uh
 		i'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids and i don't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere i want to trust the people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know you hear in the newspaper you hear on the T V and you read the newspaper quite often of of people that you know
 		don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of so and
 		hope to never get into that situation where we have to have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children and hope that we can stay in this situation  for awhile so
 	
 	
 		yeah  you know we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here and  i guess
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know it are it's uh typically uh whether it's been child care in a home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution and you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children and it's not
 		and it's more of a group home rather than actually day care  type of facility uh so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true that's true
 		
 
 		well Steven it's been
 	
 	
 		so
