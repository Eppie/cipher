 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay i thought it was supposed to give a recording but anyway
 		um
 		well i i do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for for my wife and for me and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial all we all i do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are
 		outstanding and and every two or three months
 		update that and every once in a while
 		make a list of what we spent that month but i doubt i do it more than three times a year
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you use a computer
 	
 	
 		and
 		no i work with them all day yeah i'm in computer science yet i i do everything on paper  uh i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off
 		when um he was a Marine he went to Saudi Arabia and while he was gone
 		i got all of our bills paid off so really the only bills i have is rent utilities insurance
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know so they come in i pay them and that's it you know that's about the extent of it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		i don't really have this major budget or anything i just really i'm real thrifty i take care of you know two children and me and um just real careful with the money you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what little we have  so that's what i do
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a pretty
 		straightforward
 		it's almost i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		you know fancy budgets it seems like if you're getting to that level you're you're not in real good control
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		you know i mean i i i've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know you buy something on credit and you pay twice as much for it when you get done
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so
 	
 	
 		actually i'm i mean i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because that way it's a record of everything and i don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month
 	
 	
 		i don't have too many weaknesses
 		i don't have too many weaknesses but i found out a credit card was one of them
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		you know it's so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person it's like oh well that's on sale let's go grab it you know  so um
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and if you don't have the money then use the credit card so i got rid of them credit cards
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess if that's
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do
 	
 	
 		yeah that was my weakness it wasn't bad i mean i didn't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that just i just learned that that wasn't for me you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so
 		but i self employed
 		you know i have my own little cleaning business type thing so um i keep
 	
 	
 		do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that or
 	
 	
 		no it's not hard i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made and um you know what it's gonna have to go for that month and

 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know it's not that not that hard
 		not at all
 	
 	
 		well that's good to know
 	
 	
 		so
 		i always do my own income tax
 		you know do you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it seems like it's absurd the number of people who had to having to pay somebody to do it
 	
 	
 		read all you got to do is read a book
 		mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to
 	
 	
 		i
 		yeah just the form yeah
 		yeah and a lot of them
 	
 	
 		it's dumb you know i guess if you had some really complicated
 		stuff but i don't so i don't mess with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't use a calculator either you know i don't i don't have that much that many you know things to add up so
 	
 	
 		i
 		
 
 		i don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer to too much stuff like that because i wanna make sure that that i
 		i keep
 		on top of the numbers and understand what's going on i know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		and we have a i i bank at NCNB here and they have a number that you can call in and i always call in like
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		once every other week or so and i will um check off what checks have cleared and
 		do you do that
 	
 	
 		yeah we have the same thing
 	
 	
 		you do too and i always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because i always want to know exactly what i have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i do that real often
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i do that so
 		anyway
