 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay you first
 	
 	
 		all right um  well basically i think we uh probably pay more out in taxes than we should uh we don't see the sort of feedback that we need from it
 	
 	
 		
   
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um i think the government waste a lot of the money um and spends it on purposes that that the government really shouldn't be spending it on um i don't think that it's effectively used
 	
 	
 		yeah i i agree i don't think it's uh effectively used um as far as the amount um
 	
 	
 		so
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i'm never really sure about the amount because there's so much that
 		needs to happen in this country that isn't happening and that not that the government necessarily should be the agent through which it's accomplished but
 		there's a lot of things that are crying out for somebody to do something with and the last fifty years everybody looked to the government for that sort of thing primarily
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		and uh i i agree with you that things are just not used effectively
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah i think
 	
 	
 		and we you know people don't want to live within their means we've got huge deficits that doesn't appear to you know nobody's talking about the deficit at all on the current campaigns at all
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		right right
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and i was amazed in the State of the Union address and Bush i don't think mentioned the D word once the whole time it was amazing and it kept he keeps coming with these spending plans and i'm like okay where is the money coming from
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 		exactly exactly i mean it they keep on thinking that you know it's okay to borrow against the future indefinitely um and they don't realize that once they create these programs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you well they have such a hard time killing off a program yeah once once it starts receiving funding it its like yanking wisdom teeth to try and get it uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		killed you know even when and you know i don't know a lot of the things i think the federal government does uh it does very poorly um
 		i'm kind of a state's right person and i think that a lot of of what the federal government could do could be handled uh more efficiently uh on a state level
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know state to state because the states i think have a better idea of where where they need to spend the money for the kind of population that they have um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and i think the federal government is just too far removed from the the specific situation
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um you know i mean there there are some things that our taxes need to be spent on um at a federal level like national uh defense and uh you know common rule making and things like that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i think a lot of it could be handed over to the states you know especially things like welfare and and you know food stamps that kind of programs um so
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah yeah
 		
  
 		and round most of those are state administered aren't they
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um yes and no um a lot of it you know the states get like matching funds or you know they they get a certain amount of funds that they get to do with as they please but um
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		okay
 		
  
 	
 	
 		why you know why doesn't the state take in the revenue directly then you know uh kind of eliminating some of those bureaucracy that goes on
 	
 	
 		right right
 		
  
 		right if if yeah it sounds sounds very good and i but i wonder about states like Mississippi and Louisiana that always tend to have and Arkansas and Arkansas significantly with Clinton running but it
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		states that always seem to have really poor educational systems um and just generally a very very poor economy i mean Louisiana was picking up for a while with the energy boom in the seventies but
 		still their economy never really got off the ground and
 		you know it it i don't know i don't live in Louisiana or any of those states and i don't ever think that i will but so it's really none of my business but it's like something you know i i it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i don't know it seems like somehow not enough is being done to educate people there and things like that to to be able to participate with yeah the rest of us in the in the world it's just pre elitist but
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know the the rest of us in the country at least
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yes oh yeah i agree exactly um
 	
 	
 		and then i yeah i know there's plenty of people in California here who don't have enough education either i mean you know that's always the a major political football problem in any state the education system
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		oh yeah yeah i well i think we're seeing a major decline um but
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um i'm i'm not sure how that relates directly to taxation um
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh trying to stay on the topic here
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		yeah well i don't think it really matters anyway because it you know they'll what they want is natural conversations and i think the topic just to kind of give us a boost in that direction
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but getting back to taxes um currently i think the the current system we got isn't really
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		it it isn't taxing the rich enough essentially um it i think that
 	
 	
 		hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		people people don't have an idea that the whole we're all in this together and in the eighties that wasn't the common theme the common theme was you know get rich quick for a lot of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		right
