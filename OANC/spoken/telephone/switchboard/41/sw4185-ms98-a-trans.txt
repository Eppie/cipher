 
     		
 	
 		um so you do you have children no
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		no um i'm single uh my parents are divorced so i can relate to not having enough family time
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay um i don't have i'm single  um my family moved around a lot and i was at boarding school so i can relate to not having family time
 	
 	
 		um
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so uh so what do you think it's important for  as far as spending quality time with family
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well uh my parents didn't have a lot in common and that's that's what really brought on the divorce is just uh growing terribly apart they got married too young and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		my dad i never really knew my dad um he was just a man in the house we um he he my parents were together until i was about sixteen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i never i i talked to him but it was just in passing you know we spent well the older i got the less time we spent together
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um we we talked maybe five minutes out of a week
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and so so i loved him and we talked well you know we gave each other other hugs and asked how our day had been and that was the extent of it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh huh
 	
 	
 		everyday you know that would be the most we'd talk about for just a couple of minutes and
 	
 	
 		
  
 		what about your mom um-hum okay
 	
 	
 		oh well i am very close to my mother uh we talk all the time i live with her now my parents have been divorced for about three years three and a half four years and um
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		okay
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and we talk all the time we're very close and she is a real personable relationship oriented woman
 	
 	
 		well that's good that's good um my my parents and i didn't talk while i was growing up so uh they sort of did their thing and i did my thing  so um
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh we they're not divorced but um  they're missionaries and their you know their job
 		came first family second it seemed anyway
 	
 	
 		right oh dear
 	
 	
 		so  that's the way i saw it so we didn't really spend much family time together i didn't think um and they you know i was in the basketball and track team and they never came to any of that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so things like that so if if i had a family i'd make sure that i would go to events you know that my kids would be involved in because it's really important
 	
 	
 		
  
 		sure
 		
  
 		sure
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know to help them to feel like they're special or you know important
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i'm a Christian and i know that that God is supposed to be your priority but your family's priority above church work
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		is is what i've always believed my dad was chairman of the deacons in our church
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he put time with the church church uh uh the church burned by accident um uh the you know when i was real young and we were in the process of building another house
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my dad put working on the church building uh before working with my mother on the house kind of left to her
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and really left the family completely behind to work on the church and to be you know what everybody would consider to be a good leader of the church
 	
 	
 		
  
 		wanted him to be yeah
 	
 	
 		right right and and he had more of a desire with with with the rest of the church members to be with us and so that that was definitely a problem
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh
 		
  
 		yeah sounds like it
 	
 	
 		and uh when when my parents divorced i i think my mother has trouble staying in church because um she's just she just knows that there's a lot of hypocrites and um
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		that you you just have to put that part behind you
 	
 	
 		right there is hypocrites everywhere anytime you have uh a group of people
 	
 	
 		oh sure sure and
 		oh sure and not everybody is going to get along but uh yeah that that was definitely a a problem in the marriage and they didn't communicate well at all so
 	
 	
 		
  
 		but that's right that's right
 		
  
 		
  
 		
  
 		right
 		
  
 	
 	
 		since they weren't spending time with each other hardly at all you know my dad would come home late from work because he'd visit everyone in the community before he'd come home um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		right
 		
  
 	
 	
 		me and my sister i have an older sister six years older than me that Stacy McClain oh my word
 	
 	
 		i i think i know who she is
 		yeah  in fact as you were talking i was thinking i know who you are  yeah she's in my class in fact she's Karen she's the one that got me into this
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh my goodness oh my goodness what is your name again Karen
 		
  
 		oh my goodness that's funny  well then she can tell you all about our family
 	
 	
 		and you sound like her yeah  okay
 		well she's told me a little bit but you're you're you're telling me more  i'm getting the whole scoop yeah well that's really a coincidence
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		yeah
 		oh yeah  well i have to tell her because i talked two two nights ago was from Pennsylvania then last night it was New Jersey and i didn't expect someone
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		oh really
