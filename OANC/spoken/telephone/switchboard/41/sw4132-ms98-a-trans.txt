 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		see i don't have much time myself for that kind of thing but uh i have my father was uh quite handy he died recently but uh um
 		i have done limited things like for example i've built uh  uh
 		tree house for my kids and uh
 	
 	
 		well that's a project
 	
 	
 		i really enjoy doing it i just don't have the time um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well we do a lot of our own  repair just we enjoy doing it and
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		kind of like you though it's finding the time to do it but oh things like uh
 		the inside of the house i always do the it all the painting in it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh in fact come think of it we did the outside the trim of the house and that turned out to be  quite a job since we have a two story house
 	
 	
 		um absolutely
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well have you ever done any remodeling
 	
 	
 		well not really we added a room upstairs or finished off a room upstairs
 		but that was a  that turned out to be quite a job too it was a game room and uh
 		it took us a long time
 		i mean i'm talking about a year to finish that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you know it's very interesting my uh father and i built a a home a uh new home for ourselves from basically from the ground up when i was a teenager
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's amazing how these things work one of my most um amazing amazing things is to me is that what appears to be the major part of the work basically putting the structure up happens very quickly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but then you know comes the inside and the trim and the
 		electrical work and  the fixtures and the appliances and it seems like
 		ninety percent of the time it was very frustrating takes a long time to get that house done
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the fitting i think is what is
 		took us so long you know the measurement and fitting it trying it taking it down fitting it again that  um
 	
 	
 		i see yeah
 	
 	
 		uh so we have recently built on a
 		a extra garage to our house and uh  we had a lot of well we had the concrete and stuff poured first we didn't attempt that we talked about it but
 		decided that was gonna be a bit much and uh
 		but we did all the finishing out on it and my husband has a workshop in it  or uh he races cars and we needed a spare  garage there
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and that turned out to be quite a project uh
 		we're looking at uh a lot of small things to do around the house now like uh
 		i think we are on borrowed time on things like the
 		hot water heater it's  that we're gonna change out our self that uh
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've learned to do some plumbing
 	
 	
 		do people change out these things before they fail or
 	
 	
 		well we do because uh we've had one fail and it was quite a mess for us that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it can cause a lot of damage i know
 	
 	
 		yes and so uh
 		we can tell that it's going out because of the
 		we're running out of hot water and stuff we'll have some  it's an electric heater and uh
 		we figure some of the burners or heated elements are going out  and we priced them and kind of felt like it be just as cheap for us to go on and change it out and
 		and be done with it  than this waiting for it to flood us and like it did before
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh and you can get them at discount stores fairly cheap and uh
 		we can do it ourselves it's not that much trouble just unscrewing a few pipes and screwing back some more
 	
 	
 		yeah the small those small projects are manageable you know i i fix toilets and things like that but when it comes to major
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh projects putting in stairways uh in extra stairways or putting on an extra room or something like that i just absolutely do not have the time to do that
 	
 	
 		um-hum well it is time consuming
 	
 	
 		yeah the the frustrating thing is that i enjoy doing it
 	
 	
 		oh um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um
 		you know i work  twelve hours a day seven days a week as it is so i can't
 		just don't have time for
