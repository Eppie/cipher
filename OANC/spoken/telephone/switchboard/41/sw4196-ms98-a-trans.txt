 
     		
 	
 		Steve yeah how do you keep up on current affairs
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well Frank um generally i keep on up oh listening to radio news uh listening to some television news uh the rest of it i guess what everybody's talking about um
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i guess if part of me says if it's that important i'll find out if i don't find out it's not that important into the way that it affects my life right now um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		that's a good way of looking at it
 	
 	
 		that's i guess that's primarily why um we do go through periods where we uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		do get the local newspaper um you know and for for a city of a hundred and eighty thousand people the newspaper is still very slanted and uh you know
 		you end up and you say well yeah okay and you
 	
 	
 		slightly liberal to the left or to the right
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		what'd you say
 	
 	
 		oh i would say maybe it's
 		a little morbid to the right now you know here we kind of talk more liberal and conservative rather than left right but uh it's a fairly liberal minded um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i see huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you know it's uh you tend to only get the one side you don't get kind of uh
 		a broad coverage of of the reality of what happened
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		well i get my uh news from really from all the sources uh i will say probably radio is uh
 		is a prime source because i like to listen to radio news uh on the hour for world news and then it the station i listen to usually have local news after that and i also watch the TV for
 		for news and i take two newspaper uh the local city newspaper here in Portsmouth and also the state newspaper which is the Manchester Union Leader so uh
 		you know that's that's how i stay informed plus from talking to people as you say if it's real important you're going to hear about it from other people besides
 	
 	
 		right yeah i i guess i would think that you have a bit of an advantage in that you do have a an option for something that is more local and then something that is more statewide
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um here i guess really we're dealing with uh
 		the regions being
 		i i hesitate to say sparsely populated but really you know we'll get to one region that's uh
 		several hundreds miles square and we've only got a few million people involved
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh you know so regional coverage uh is pretty sparse and so we our next step from local tends to be virtually national or international
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and i suppose you might compare it to you don't hear very much North Dakota news
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		um you know so
 	
 	
 		but you do but you do i i take it
 	
 	
 		uh we we can at times you know being you know being right on the north edge of North Dakota we
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh we actually uh some of the current events are more an aspect of uh some uh sports interaction between North Dakota and Saskatchewan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's not hardly an current event as such but um Minot does a lot of advertising to uh bring tourist industry down
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		um so you know we kind of get stuck with uh you get your local news or you get your news that's based nationally and uh so then it has
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		anything that intends to be local interest uh is quite localized Toronto Montreal Ottawa Vancouver that kind of thing you know so you're getting uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well we have a sports interaction with Quebec mainly uh Montreal uh the teams there uh both baseball and with uh with hockey of course and with Quebec and uh Quebec City
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and also uh one of the uh TV TV stations uh from Canada is on the cable system in this area uh from Sherbrook
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh we we do have some news from from Canada from time to time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's uh yeah and you know i suppose of our television we with our cable system we get uh three Detroit stations and we've got three Saskatchewan stations with
 	
 	
 		do you have CNN do you have CNN
 	
 	
 		uh yes we do we also have CNN which
 	
 	
 		that can be an important source of news international
 	
 	
 		yes uh yeah i i actually i really enjoy their format and so it is it can be quite informative on an international basis uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um i guess that would probably be my primary source for international news but uh not on a
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		regular prescribed basis tend to uh or i happen to be there and i'm and uh
