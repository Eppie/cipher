 		oh yeah that's right yeah they were really good up there we moved right before they took uh
 		well
 		yeah right we watched them down here for the Rose Bowl
 	
 	
 		they always beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl  the University of Michigan always make it to the Rose Bowl but then some uh Pac-10 team always beats them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they were they had a good team i was pretty impressed with them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they had well we followed BYU here that's who my team was and that's uh Washington came in second that year that

 		you know where Brigham Young is
 	
 	
 		no well they're i'm about an hour and a half from the campus i never went there i just like their passing their offense that's why i like watching them but that's about how far it goes
 	
 	
 		oh
 		do do you work at Morten Syco
 	
 	
 		um i work at Morten
 	
 	
 		okay i interviewed out there one time yeah

 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		huh still going to college end
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right when i graduated yeah
 	
 	
 		what do you
 		uh-huh
 		well do you go see these football games very much i mean actually in person
 	
 	
 		not i went to one football game down here in Florida i watched Miami Dolphins
 	
 	
 		oh that must've been fun
 	
 	
 		well  actually terrible they built that Joe Robbie Stadium there in uh in Miami and it's not a covered dome and when it when it does rain down here in south Florida it just it just comes down in buckets
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that particular Sunday it poured like it had never poured before and that place was like a giant funnel
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all the water goes down to the bottom of the field and the field just started filling up with water and in my seats up there they've got little drains but they don't they don't drain fast enough so we have water up to our knees
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh you're kidding
 	
 	
 		and you know warm rains tropical rains are okay but after a while you get the shivers you get cold
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it was just terrible interrupted the whole game and we went to the rest room for a while and uh there was guys emptying out the trash cans emptying out the plastic bags and cutting holes in them and putting them over their heads and stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		but the but the that that game they played the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami was beating them at first then they finally wound up losing at the end of the game so it was kind of a bomber game
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so my my football experience down here in Florida has been very bad when i was in Michigan i loved to go watch U of M play uh i played high school football
 		you know so i you know that's that's why i kept up with the sport but in Michigan it's a lot different because you can go there and it's cool weather you know down here it's hot weather it's hard to get into football
 	
 	
 		yeah it is that fall weather is really nice to watch a football game in
 	
 	
 		that really get you in the mood that late autumn sun and it's nice and cool you can bring in some peppermint Schnapps with you in the game  you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no it it is true i love that fall weather to watching a football game you can't beat that
 	
 	
 		yep you get the apple cider and stuff on the way home and
 	
 	
 		well how how many does that stadium hold at Michigan
 	
 	
 		over a hundred thousand usually they have a hundred and three thousand normally i mean a hundred and three thousand because it's all bleacher type seats and it just squish everybody together but it it
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		uh-huh
 		hundred thousand
 	
 	
 		yeah but when you're there it doesn't seem that bad because everybody's all all real nice and everything and uh like i say you just take a little hip flask of peppermint Schnapps or or something like that and everything goes real good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		boy that should be fun
 	
 	
 		yeah you have like tailgate parties there's like a golf course right near there and everybody uh has big tailgate parties you know that's
 		get like a big bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken and eat that before the game and drink beers and stuff like that and you go on out and watch the game it's really neat then after the game Ann Arbor is such a nice town uh it's a big uh it's a football town in the fall i mean it's just an all college town all around it's real fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
