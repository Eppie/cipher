 
     		
 	
 		so do you work for an employer who uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		gives you health benefits
 	
 	
 		yeah we get um i have i have good health benefits actually
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i have uh all of them and they're it's pretty cheap per month and they
 		i get to pick my own doctor and they have really good benefits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh um
 		do you have any any interesting benefits aside from basic health coverage
 	
 	
 		uh besides basic uh no i have um some
 		a little bit of uh life
 		insurance benefits
 	
 	
 		um
 		do uh do you get any kind of dental or optical coverage
 	
 	
 		uh no the the
 		uh no optical the dental is fully covered um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		except unless it's major
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but anything minor or just checkups that's all covered
 	
 	
 		and uh is your whole family covered or do
 	
 	
 		no that's just me but they can be i have that option but it's more money
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they're not they have their own
 	
 	
 		i see so through your husband or
 	
 	
 		oh no me i'm single it's just through me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		it's it's uh so it's and it that makes it cheaper too since i'm single
 	
 	
 		okay do but do you have children
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		oh okay so that's real simple yeah here uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's just for the individual and if you want to cover your family you pay a little extra but not much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		not much not for the good but it's really good the benefits are good
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah i think it's pretty significant benefit uh really uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		makes you wanna stick around
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they have they uh it does
 	
 	
 		yeah that's just what you wanna hear about uh people who are individually insured you know once you get sick you can be booted right out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh which seems kind of unfair
 		uh
 	
 	
 		do do you work where you have benefits like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we have we can choose uh
 		a couple different plans they made they try to make it real flexible where if you don't use much you actually get cash back
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		um so you can choose all these different plans some of which pay you know like everything and some of which pay very little uh you can also choose an HMO
 		uh well i used to have that when i was single and i was i found it very convenient uh and we have some optical and dental coverage that's i guess it's optional but i think we can get one pair of glasses a year
 	
 	
 		yeah the
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		really well that's good
 	
 	
 		that's so yeah it's pretty good actually uh i think a anything under a hundred dollars we can get one pair of glasses a year
 		but if you want something really fancy you pay the difference
 	
 	
 		uh-huh see that's see i wear glasses not all the time but when i read and stuff and um i wish we had some kind of optical
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		coverage but there's
 	
 	
 		yeah it's nice
 	
 	
 		there's none whatsoever and it can get expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah it can uh at least it's not like medical where it can really go through the roof you know at least somewhat limited um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		let's see you have any kind of uh
 		child care benefits or
 	
 	
 		um yeah for the um actually if you're i believe i i read up on some of it if you're pregnant
 	
 	
 		anything in
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they have really really good coverage they have um like well baby care it's it's pretty much covered
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's a problem sometimes i understand when the baby's not sick but you know you have these periodic appointments and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		especially when they're younger
 	
 	
 		yeah the doctors end up having to come up with some ailment to cover the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the appointment even though there's not really one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah some seems more honest
 	
 	
 		and though and the
 		pregnant mother has
 		uh full coverage for well mother care
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that's good that's good and do is there any kind of interesting uh what i mean what happens after the baby's born is there some uh some maternity leave policy
 	
 	
 		um that's what i was trying to i think there is i don't really remember how long it is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they do give you a certain amount of time to be home and get adjusted i guess
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		most of the benefits are pretty good the hospital benefits and and they let you pick your own doctor you have your choice actually if um it's better they give you a list
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and if and if your doctor's on that list then most of your benefits are better because those doctors are in a chain that works with the insurance company
 	
 	
 		i see so they they're preferred providers or is that a
 	
 	
 		yeah but you can have your own doctor
 	
 	
 		right and you pay a little more or certain things aren't as well covered but at least you have that option
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's nice because once in a while you find someone who deals specifically with
 		you know what you have or or somebody just somebody you've dealt with already a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah and and a lot of times because we just switched my company my uh company just switched insurance companies and before
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we did not have that choice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
