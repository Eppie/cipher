 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh how do you feel about capital punishment
 	
 	
 		uh tough question i mean it it's
 		i was actually kind of thinking about it the other day someone was talking about it how uh a person who takes someone else's life he was saying should should not deserve the right to have to keep their own life
 		it's kind of it's it's it's a really you know it's a moral dilemma i don't know um
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i think that i i forget what the law is in my state i mean my home state i'm from i'm from Maryland
 	
 	
 		yeah i have no idea what the law is anywhere i've ever lived i just
 	
 	
 		and i just
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know so
 		i i personally uh even though
 		i understand the principle behind capital punishment i don't agree with it ever applying applying capital punishment to anyone
 		um because i sort of believe that if we've got a person arrested that sure we can uh we can say you know it's a murderer he's done heinous crimes
 		but we can keep him in jail for the rest of his life and not give him a terribly pleasant existence
 		and uh there's just no reason to justify killing a person and you know there may be an economic reason but i don't think that's sufficient to justify uh killing someone
 		if you believe that killing is wrong you you might as well apply that to you know even that stays stays true even if you're punishing someone i know that's how i feel
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it kind of seems going back to uh eye for an eye hand for a hand kind of thing
 		maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's like uh
 		you kind of wonder do you want someone like Jeffrey Dahmer alive or not
 		oh or or Charles Manson
 	
 	
 		well
 		it's just that i feel like they don't really pose a threat if they're imprisoned you know sufficiently and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i i i guess it would be bad if the politics ever changes and they got out for some reason but
 	
 	
 		i don't see it happening
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like i don't see Charles Manson i think he'll never get out he's
 		he's probably going to be up for parole in a year or so but he's not going to it's not going to happen
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		but the thing is you know when these guys get out it can be so quiet you may not notice i mean if the public doesn't hear about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		for some reason i mean the thing is Charles Manson was really publicly well know but
 		if it's somebody who's you know a serial killer but he never was really in the media a lot then when he gets out he still won't be in the media
 	
 	
 		this could be
 	
 	
 		yeah so i you know
 		uh it could be bad if somebody got out i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah i i still i think even if they aren't in the media i don't know if it would happen unless maybe it was
 		uh bureaucracy that got pushed aside
 		and someone said ah we'll let them out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know someone i don't know i mean i guess there's are probably are small time serial killers that you don't hear about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		something um
 	
 	
 		well there have to be because
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh uh i don't know there's like
 		well i don't know the numbers but i mean there's at least dozens of capital punishments every year
 		from what i that's what i think it is
 		and you know you don't hear about all of those
 	
 	
 		i don't know um because i think i don't think they actually execute prisoners very too often because there's i mean there's death row
 		there's a lot of time where uh prisoners are kept on death row for a long time i mean yeah there was uh Ted Bundy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there was uh i mean there was such an outcry to um to execute him because it i mean he was the the crimes he did were just so heinous
 		um
 		now i i think that there's it's just such a controversial thing that it doesn't happen too often i'm not so i i don't at least at least i don't hear about it that often
 	
 	
 		right yeah i don't i don't know either
 		so
 	
 	
 		um
 		nah i don't think there's been an execution in my state in a long time that i know of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i know that like
 		um
 		uh one of the one of the things that that's that's one of the things that the that Amnesty International is against in the United States is capital punishment yeah
 	
 	
 		they're against capital punishment
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		of any of any kind so that's the one the one thing they have against the United States one of their gripes
 	
 	
 		well
 		aren't do a lot of countries countries not have capital punishment
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i don't know there might be some that don't
 	
 	
 		that'd be interesting to find out who doesn't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		tough to uh
 		to um what's word i'm looking for uh to justify
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i guess
 		i kind of waver i guess sometimes
 		it's like
 		someone like Jeffrey Dahmer you kind of want
