 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i think the matrix system
 		would be a wonderful thing for the United States and for um United States being able to trade more easy with other people in the world
 		as the world economy become  much more global
 		just having a standard system of measurement especially one that easy to calculate where G not become one and all kinds of nice stuff like that is
 		just a wonderful advantage
 	
 	
 		yeah i i agree with you there
 		the metric system is very good i'm um i'm um
 		do drafting i'm i'm a engineer and i've done drawing and and have to do calculation of fluid mechanics and thing
 	
 	
 		oh right yeah so you get
 	
 	
 		and if you ever have to try to do four different conversions to to to try and all  four different type of system with gravitational constant
 	
 	
 		that's exactly right
 	
 	
 		and it it just goes it just goes on and on
 		another thing thing is that when doing your drawing you can scale them so much easier thing because their increment of ten's so much easier
 	
 	
 		i remember
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean your your life is just uh so much easier i
 		i really think that what can be done differently
 		is that it's it's to ingrain in our society to shift it all our prototype all our our mode our template  our bolts our threads everything
 	
 	
 		that's right the tools are that's the expensive thing
 	
 	
 		the tooling the tooling is is so is so uh in in our system that it just it it just going to take a lot to move it away
 	
 	
 		that right if you think that every garage corner garage has to buy a whole new set of tools
 	
 	
 		well most of them have the matrix set now but it's it's it's uh i think it's more in the the the the bolts and threads and stuff it self i mean the
 		the screw machine and stuff that makes all those thing they're just they cost millions of you know thousand hundred of thousand's of dollars and thing and that's
 		and i guess maybe they could be resented some of them could be resented but the company the business community just doesn't want to do that i think what really needs to be done is that they need to be educated that in the long run their life is going to be so much easier
 	
 	
 		right but not only will their life would be easier easier they'll be able to make more money selling things abroad
 	
 	
 		oh exactly also the trade you're you're exactly right
 		yeah it's uh we need to do that
 		and uh as i said the the main thing you know like just in the calculation the the
 	
 	
 		i know i most calculation i remember when i took fluid mechanics and
 		i the professor was telling us how he wanted us to give the answer and i was he said he wanted them the answer in the English system because the engineers needed to know how to use the English system
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		i i treat to give my answer in toundar
 	
 	
 		in what
 	
 	
 		toundar which is a um toundar T O U N D A R
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh okay i know what that is yeah
 	
 	
 		so he he didn't like that very much
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's
 		you know and then that each individual company has their own set of guidelines they they they use
 		but we our  our society in the United State in the global in in the world
 		and the economic seem that nobody really wants to be
 		compatible with everybody else we started out with the computers
 		and we've we've had to fight tooth and nail just to get them to be some what compatible and they're all just going off and all different all these different directions
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i guess one of the problem is is that the goal isn't to produce produce
 		produce the technology the goal is to produce the buck the the all mighty dollar is so powerful that it just it it just control our destiny
 	
 	
 		well there's always the conflict between innovation and standardization
 		and they're it's always going to be true that the most advantage advance thing and the thing that has the highest performance for any given
 		application are going to be non standard
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		for the general everyday things that have been worked out
 		the standardization is such an advantage
 		so and something like what side of the road you drive on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess there was a time when that had to be worked out
 		and
 		before very many people were driving it wasn't a problem
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah well i guess
 		so you just
 		yeah i guess that's that's true
 		i really  like first thought i can't really think of what the different would be the different has to do with uh
