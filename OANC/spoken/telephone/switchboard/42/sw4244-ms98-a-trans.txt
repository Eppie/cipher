 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay i think we're all set there hopefully
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well uh care of the elderly is something that is hitting pretty close to home at me uh right now my father-in-law has uh
 		been diagnosed with terminal cancer
 		and my mother-in-law is in a wheel chair so this is something that i've been thinking quite a bit about lately
 		and uh
 		i'm i feel pretty strongly and the rest of my family does that is long as someone is able to care for
 		uh someone else
 		that they shouldn't be put in a home but there's there's a very hard question of of what happens when someone isn't able to provide that care for themselves
 		um
 		in the case of my mother-in-law she's not able to to bathe herself but she's sharp as a tack at this point and
 		what sort of facilities are available for that person it's hard because you think of a home and you're really thinking of
 		of uh old people left somewhere to uh you know fairly forgotten and that's
 		that's that's a hard thing and i'm sure not all of them are like that
 	
 	
 		well unfortunately that's the typical picture though
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so it's it's very hard to find a facility that would allow uh allow someone of fair degree of autonomy in their life
 		but yet would still be there to help provide some of the basic services
 		
  
 	
 	
 		is your mother-in-law currently uh living in a nursing home or anything
 	
 	
 		no she's not um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		she's still at home and her son has has moved back into the house uh which which was not as inconvenient as it sounds because uh
 		um my father-in-law and my brother-in-law have a dental lab in the basement so he was working out of the house anyway
 		uh so it it's a little less
 		uh it's it's not all that inconvenient for him
 		but
 		the rest of the kids are scattered uh throughout the northeast
 		and he doesn't want to feel that he's
 		uh he's going to be completely responsible for this only because he happens to live right there with with my in-laws
 		
  
 	
 	
 		have you guys thought about the financial burden
 		of caring for
 		your mother-in-law as far as putting her in a nursing home down the road
 	
 	
 		that that has we've all thought about that fortunately uh that doesn't seem to be a big problem but
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		that we there's some thought that has to be given to to uh
 		to the property for instance they have about four three or four acres in Connecticut
 		and what no one wants to see is uh that land having to be sold off simply to keep her in a in a nursing home what we'd like to do
 		is uh find the sort of place where i try described before where  she'd be able to have uh a place of her own but yet also have someone come in a couple of times a day to help her with various
 		various things and have someone there in case she falls or something
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well my mother my grandmother is in a place similar to that where she has emergency buttons throughout the throughout the house or actually the apartment
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and she's about eighty one and she lives she has her own little area for gardening and so forth it's in the  housing authority up here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and it's
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		
  
 	
 	
 		when she first moved up here she ended up living in  uh tall apartment building a complex that was very similar to a hospital
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		a very negative feeling when you walked in the building
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and now she's been very fortunate
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		in that she's almost almost like living in a small home
 	
 	
 		that's that's great
 	
 	
 		and she she still has an a large maintenance staff take care of the place look after her
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		provide uh
 		basic busing services and travel
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i'm hoping that the trend is toward places like that
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		as
 		the population in America uh
 		lives for a longer period of time uh
 		i i guess thirty years ago when when you were that age and you weren't able to really care for yourself
 		you really weren't going to uh you know be around that much longer and so the level of care required
 		was was different but now people are are living longer and can uh
 		can have injury
