 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well who wants to go first here
 	
 	
 		you you can go ahead
 	
 	
 		well to me capital punishment is uh
 		how should i say it uh i don't think it's it's neither the last thing that it's neither the first uh
 		thing that i would  think that needs to be done you know to great length uh how should say it uh not wholesale or something to be shunned at all costs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it is uh
 		something that i think that uh is uh
 		
 
 		necessary uh under circumstances under many circumstances
 	
 	
 		well i think um
 		i don't think really it should go much  for
 		you know rapist or
 		just people who broke into a house nothing like that but i think if someone's killed someone then they deserve to die
 		that's how i see it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah uh my uh i heard a guy one time who explained it uh in in in kind of a natural way he said uh said just outside of my door there's a
 		there's a hornet's nest and uh that's you're from Atlanta right
 	
 	
 		no Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh excuse me Dallas do they have hornets in Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh they have big bees
 	
 	
 		okay big bees anyway says there's a hornet's nest right outside of his door and he says i i hate to do it but i had to uh to uh
 		to get rid of them and they were just doing what they were supposed to do you know that's what nature equipped them to do and they were doing their thing and but it was pretty threatening to my family so i got rid of them and then he said uh now i have uh he says
 		and that was too bad it's too bad i couldn't relocate it
 		
 
 		and he said now i have a uh we have somebody who has the will and the ability to be good but instead they choose to be very bad they can destroy any lives and and uh uh and and if not your life your uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		mental stability so to speak after they submit you to to uh and he says uh i don't have a lot of feeling for them i have more feeling for the for the hornets than i do for these people that are preying on on uh society
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm uh let's see the the other question i had i guess was uh i heard one person on the radio say
 		uh where do we get the right to put these people death and  or the the corresponding question is where do we get the right to put people in jail at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i think um i think it's kind of sad people who a guy can go out and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		completely slaughter a family and there's always got to be one person saying that they should have a chance to live and that the person who did the murdering should have a chance to live and i just don't think that's right i think it just makes me
 		want the killer to go after that person's family just one person just to see so that that person will see how the other family felt
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just so that they'll they can understand all the pain that they're going through and you know then they wouldn't be saying well that killer has a life too because it's not true the as soon as the killer kills someone they they should deserve to die their life is over too
 		i mean they took someone else's life so i don't i just don't think they should deserve to live i think  everybody who's ever murdered
 		well i don't know because there's always people who um
 		like fathers who a daughter was raped and they went after the the rapist
 		i think that's kind of a good crime there
 	
 	
 		in my uh you're you're more conservative than some people that i could've talked to but
 		i kind of agree with that uh there's there are people out there who just choose to uh like i said based on my little hornet example they choose to do bad then they  because they're human have the ability to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to uh to do immense harm and uh when a person chooses to do that time after time i don't have a lot of uh uh i i just don't feel like they're
 		you know what's there to say uh there are people out there that have made mistakes and they're sorry for it uh i feel bad for them but on the other hand
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anything in nature that doesn't that doesn't
 		rid itself of of uh decay
 		uh winds up in pretty sad shape and i think that's what we're having now and so we've got some pretty sad sad conditions out there we've got these guys that go out there and and uh do drug uh uh how should i say it wholesale murders
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		what that means is that the politicians rather than try and clean up this that nest of uh problems they'll they'll come out to uh to uh
 		people and they'll say what you you have to uh we're going to enact stricter laws on the rest of you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and and so uh i don't know i i've i've i i guess you can say i'm
 		pretty strongly in favor of capital punishment as long as as long as it's not uh
