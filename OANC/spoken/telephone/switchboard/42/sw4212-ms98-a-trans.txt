 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well Jim sounds like you're starting out on something new uh
 		so
 		what kind of uh aspect do you have as for as budgeting
 	
 	
 		well we're we're actually saving you know both for the wedding and for a house right now so it's kind of a double whammy uh where i i stood out uh i been few i uh bachelor for a long time so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i was kind of living for the the day and  what a debt so the last year or so i've been killing off a lot of debt and actually and uh
 		in May when the stock plan i'm in comes due i'm going to wipe out the last of my debt i'm going to be totally out of debt
 		in we have a nice uh start toward a house
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		um and
 		we we come from a very different background where i came from a fairly affluent middle class family and my fiance came from a lower class uh
 		save every penny you've got family so we've kind of i taught her to to let go a little bit more and she taught me to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		do budgeting and you know really evaluate what kind of stuff we're doing
 	
 	
 		well that's good  i guess our situation uh
 		well we've been married twenty years and i guess our budgeting is it's actually minimum and we've gone through period where we've needed to budget on quite formally but uh we've gotten to where we structure
 		a lot of our thing so that they uh use use a automatic debit with our banking account
 	
 	
 		yeah i i use to do that but um
 		i found that it it doesn't give you the flexibility floating something a couple of days when you need to
 	
 	
 		right yeah i guess um you know the situation i'm in um
 		my pay is  given at a particular period of time and it never varies and you know so there's something that we've just found that it works best to deal with the you know the the regular fixed expenses uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i suppose when when you've got you you know a a when you got a good pad of of money where you know you don't have have when you're not you know you cash flow bound
 		that's where to work at
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		yeah um  i guess um
 		there really haven't been a lot of thing that we have picked on that have work for us other then you know  the uh the automatic
 		debits require require more discipline
 		um it also simplifies in that
 		doesn't require the discipline to say oh yes that is due on this date and then make the appropriate trip to the bank or whoever and uh so actually we live in uh
 		in  in Canada and so with our banking system being more national
 		uh it does make uh funds transfer and that kind of thing a lot more
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've got i've got direct direct deposit i find what i helps a often lot is i have Quicken
 	
 	
 		readily available
 	
 	
 		on my PC and i've got for the next six to eight month all my pay checks all my fix expenses
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in there so i i can look at my cash flow and i can say you know i've got to pay these on these dates and i can structure these debt payment around here
 		you know not debt payment in sense in the sense you know paying off against
 		you know legal thing like you know paying credit cards off and things so that you know i can really map out and say on this date i'll have this cash flow and i'll have this net worth
 	
 	
 		great
 	
 	
 		and that help an often lot to look forward
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh i would think you know i would think it did
 		um
 		yeah i guess you know in the late of budgeting it's something that we always have been very week on and i guess for us the challenge is now that we've got a son fifteen and a daughter eighteen that we're trying to train
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right well i mean i mean i found it was  for a long time you know i really was living for the moment and i i think that my
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i got such mixed message message from my folks about
 		budgeting because  i mean even to this day they their you know both of them are out of work now because of the one full economy in Massachusetts
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they're both in social in uh you know uh human services
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		they got hit real good but you know they're still remodeling stuff and things
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you know in in the sense you know they they would criticize me for going out and
 		and and spending money on on things to make myself happy but then they go and you know do do what to me are cosmetic improvement to the house to you know get the same kind of thing now that that more of a value added to there house then me going out and getting CD's or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know it's the same kind of thing where they always thought i was getting mixed mixed message about that
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's
 		that becomes the biggest challenge you know if i think about it myself is the budgeting impact from a parenting role uh
 		it take
 		it takes so long for a person to develop
 		that budgeting skill and there's  i think it's going to become more critical because
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		of
 		were now
