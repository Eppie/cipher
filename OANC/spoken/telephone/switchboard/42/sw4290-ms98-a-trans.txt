 
     		
 	
 		i generally uh prefer to do repairs that i am capable of doing myself if it results in significant money savings
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah um
 		i always used to do the the you know the the fairly simple repairs uh recently i haven't because uh uh time's become more of a premium for me
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'm finding that too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it's also you know it's also getting to the point where i'm sitting there saying well gee unless i am really enjoy doing this this it's costing me more money to do it myself then it would for uh i mean that's the reason  i mean it
 	
 	
 		that's right you better you better enjoy doing it or else it's not really worth it
 	
 	
 		right i
 	
 	
 		the last one that that i did myself was i was i found that i was backing out of the garage and i got a little too close to the door on the driver's side i was uh watching too closely on the passenger side i guess
 		and i wasn't paying attention closely enough and i ended up
 		whacking my uh side view mirror off the side of my car which kind of uh made me kick myself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah the the the other things you always do oh geez shoot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i looked into getting that replaced and that was going to cost a fair amount of money because i would have to take it to the uh dealer
 		who would put a factory replacement part on and then charge me fifty bucks and hour to do the work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so i figured well i can do that myself i i'll pick up the mirror myself which alone was more money than i wanted to spend on a just a stupid little mirror but it's one of those power ones and it's heated heated and
 		and all that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i was going on a trip the next day so i figured i'd go out and put the mirror on but i ended up i had to take the whole door apart uh to
 	
 	
 		oh because you couldn't access you couldn't access it
 	
 	
 		yeah to get the cable where the cable plugged in to the uh to the rest of the system was way down in the door
 	
 	
 		right
 		so it ended up being a bitch huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it was more than i really wanted to do and then i got it i finally got it all apart figured out what i had to do and i put the mirror on and i got it plugged in and i put the door back together
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and everything was fine i also have power windows and i had to have the window down to do what i was doing
 		and oh no i'm sorry i had to have the window up to do what i was doing and i went to uh
 		no it was down it was down i had to have the window down i went to uh put the window back up it was the middle of winter and the window wouldn't go up because i had the cable yeah
 	
 	
 		so you had a trip that you had to go to the next day in the middle of winter and your window would not come back up all right
 	
 	
 		and no i took the door all apart again and i moved the cable over so it wasn't blocking the window but uh i don't know it used to be fun doing those sorts of things and i don't maybe i'm loosing interest or
 		also cars are getting a lot more complex than they used to be
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's part of the reason why i have cut down also is that uh same reason uh last thing i did was just replace my uh uh light on uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know headlights in the front now that one i you know it actually they actually said to go in and get the service person to do that too and i said well forget that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh but and it was kind of a a pain
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because you uh you you couldn't really fix it without leaving the lights on
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because it i didn't have it doesn't have a uh off
 		yeah it's one of those um uh flipping type headlights
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah
 	
 	
 		and you
 	
 	
 		so you have to have it up so you have to have the light on
 	
 	
 		right right and some of them you know they have uh uh one click where you where it goes up and it's like not on on some of the some but this one did not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		no but i figured a way to get around it but it was kind of a really stupid way to have to do it is you is you get it up in the air and then you turn then you take the battery off and then it then it can't bring it back down  all right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		that's one way to do it
 	
 	
 		right and then but then the lights are still out  so you're not sitting there going i can't see
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now i think my mechanic mechanic found a way to do that there's a switch somewhere that you can push that uh pop the light up without turning it on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know where that is on my car because i have the flip up type too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but he did something to make that happen
 	
 	
 		right i mean there there probably is but they didn't bother to tell me so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right privileged information
 	
 	
 		that's great uh then that's the other thing is that there always seems to be some really weird tool
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		and things like you know oil filters every every car now it's so tight in in in the region where where the engines are you can never get to the oil filter
 	
 	
 		yep
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		though though i guess it's getting a little better again because um what they did is first they used to have the big cars and big engines
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		then they got the small cars with the not well designed engines now they're redesigning enough that some that to some extent it's it's accessible again but i remember a couple of those cars you know you'd sit there and say
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		there's no way anyone could get in there unless they could take the car and put it up into the air
 	
 	
 		yep that's right or unless it's high enough off the ground that you can crawl underneath it
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's not usually easy either
 	
 	
 		and i uh every year you hear somebody gets themselves killed by climbing under a car or under a jack and the only thing you you know i guess you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
