 
     		
 	
 		Jeff what do you think are you paying to much in taxes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i certainly think that in some cases i am but uh i think it's mostly on the federal area were i don't see as much
 		maybe for for my money as uh i might uh i thought of
 		school taxes as well and i was very involved in schools uh in the local community a couple years ago and it was pretty easy to see where it went all there but i guess i have the same opinion that some American have that uh uh it's all fat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well i i i'm one of those that i'm kind of glad i don't get all the government i pay for
 	
 	
 		i tell me more i don't understand
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i just ship off so much money to the federal government and if they really uh took it and and did things to govern me well that would be a lot more government than what i think i need
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		oh uh the one i guess that on a daily basis the one that bother me is the sale tax i'm paying eight and a quarter percent on sale tax
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yes
 		at
 	
 	
 		yeah that that adds up
 	
 	
 		yeah and and you know you you put put your money down on the counter thinking that is enough to pay for it then you need another dollar because you had not guess right on the sale tax
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it certainly adds up quickly yes
 		and i've heard it said that of course that effect that effect us across the board in terms of social economic uh areas everybody pays that sale tax
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		um i guess that's i i guess i'm luck here i only pay five percent
 		and
 	
 	
 		that that sound great to me
 	
 	
 		well if you want to move here uh all you have to do is find a job so i guess you trade things off one way or another
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah i suppose so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah there there has been a lot of going on in Texas in term of financing schools
 		uh there some judge decide that we had to have pay equal amount to students i mean you know education dollars per student all across the state well as you know it's very large state
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		cool
 	
 	
 		and it certainly cost more in in some areas than it does in others
 	
 	
 		exactly they uh
 	
 	
 		and
 		the they they call it the robin hood plan plan taking from the from the mostly prosperous urban district or suburb district and passing it alone to the rural districts so i don't know that that's going to be in the courts for a long time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i would think so uh that sort of thing has been tried here and
 		the results are results the results were not too hardening uh and the belief here is uh kind of education what do we need that for
 	
 	
 		huh well that that's about the attitude here is just that you know if if you're paying for your local tax you're paying your local school district you can see some results of it but it's if you stop and think that some of that money is going to go get shipped off to South Texas or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you it its almost like i don't know socialism or something isn't it
 	
 	
 		exactly uh and i would think base upon my experience you have to have some of that uh consider uh some of these places in Idaho that have a school district of a total of about two hundred or three hundred children
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and there a certain amount of overhead in running a school district uh for instance those kids may be spread out uh over an area where driving the buses you may go forty or fifty or even sixty miles
 		and
 		can you really expect the uh the people in that district to support all that overhead of getting the kids to and from school so some of the money come through the states from all people in the state basically equal well base upon their income
 		to i'm sorry i i take i that back a little bit of it comes from their income uh
 		to support doing thing like that and that's probably okay uh it's kind of like telephone where uh the folk that live in the middle of town subsidize for people that have lines that go out for four or five miles
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the other thing that we have is a property tax and that tend to subsidies part of it also
 		uh the disadvantage there of course the people get into is they say hey i don't have any kids in school i've been retried for thirty five years and i'm still paying for somebody education
 	
 	
 		i know huh
 		huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i guess i'm a believe in yes you have to you have to have some overhead just like uh i never used the fire department but at the some time i'll hate to have to ante up before they got here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes it's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's true do you have income tax and
 	
 	
 		yes yes yes we still pay that i suspect it's not quite a higher percentage as you may pay
 	
 	
 		we don't have a state income tax yet
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		huh it's coming
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's it's on its way i i'm almost certain
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but that's why we have that eight and a quarter percent sales tax
 	
 	
 		i i certainly
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and and you know the the damage
