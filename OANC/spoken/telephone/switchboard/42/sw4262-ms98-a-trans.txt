 
     		
 	
 		okay well two things that come to mind with me first um is one i think more emphasis should placed on
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the the English and and some of the basics i mean we we can get so specialized into you know extracurricular activities that we've got kids graduating high school that don't know how to read and write
 		and such like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah there seems to be a little bit of bias towards extracurricular stuff even all the way up through college
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		gets really out of hand i'll agree with you on that one
 	
 	
 		yes it does
 	
 	
 		uh you said two things
 	
 	
 		well the other one is i think we i think we need to do a little bit more to keep kids in school
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i agree with you on that i happen to think the school system's pretty good
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and that uh the problem lies in uh teaching the kids to care and you know raising them up to care
 		i'm not sure how to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think uh
 		you know the i mean the obvious examples are kids from broken families or families where the parents really don't care but
 		but i know that a lot most parents do care and you know there's still problems
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure what the answer there is
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think i mean i think but overall we've got a really good system it's just
 		
 
 		we crowd a lot of kids a lot of kids in with one teacher
 		and i know i i know i'm in a i'm i'm in college right now and um we have real small classes
 		we we're very fortunate in that we do and which is good because i mean the the people that i'm in class with we all learn different ways
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and this way um i know my teacher real well and we can work on how i learn best
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so you like a sort of a one-on-one situation with the teacher
 	
 	
 		well not so much a one-on-one but  you know like a ten or a fifteen on one as compared as compared to thirty and such
 	
 	
 		yeah when i when i was in high school and grade school
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i noticed the classes that i got the most out of were the ones where there were a few at least you know a few other students who were interested
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so there'd be a lively discussion in the class
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if if no one cared you know it didn't matter if the teacher was exciting or not it'd be he'd be talking he or she'd be talking at you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and if the teacher was an idiot which did happen
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		if the other kids were into it you know you could have a lot of fun uh with the material anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		so to me i i i'm i'm going to back and say it's the students have got to be looking to learn uh
 		they've got to be curious
 		and i think that's something that the the school system really doesn't address at all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean that there's a few interesting good classes
 		were uh you know a teacher will come
 		and really interest a kid but most of them
 		you know it's pretty much up to the kids
 	
 	
 		to carry it through
 	
 	
 		yeah to to be interested and you know you talk to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you talk to people on the street and they don't know history they don't know geography and it doesn't bother them they they really don't care it's not important to them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for some reason i mean it's it's not that they're stupid because they're not
 		these things that i feel are important to living in the world are not important to them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		but still you know your basic your basic English your reading and your writing and you know and some of your math you know are very essential
 	
 	
 		yeah and people don't know this because they don't feel that it's important
 	
 	
 		you know
 		right
 		
  
 	
 	
 		though that's what okay i i editorialized i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		no that's okay
 	
 	
 		i  it seems to me that they don't feel it's important and that's why they don't know English
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i i've run into a couple of those yeah
 		yeah
 		i don't know i i think it's
 		i mean i've heard some some some school districts that have that have uh found some really unique ways about getting around the problems and
 		you know of
 		even though we've got a really good system the problems of you know as far comparing right now they're real big into comparing our stats with that of other countries
 		have you seen that
 	
 	
 		uh yeah we're uh falling further and further behind the cutting edge apparently
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh what are these interesting programs you mentioned
 	
 	
 		well um i have i've just heard briefly about one
