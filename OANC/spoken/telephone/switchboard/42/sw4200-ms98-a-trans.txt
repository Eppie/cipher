 
     		
 	
 		so tell me where do you get most of your uh news information from
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i i subscribe to two different newspapers the Gwinnete Daily News and the Journal so morning and afternoon and
 		i guess that's where i get most of it and then i always whenever i'm in the car i'm listening to WGST or WSB and uh read the news uh reports on the computer networks and uh
 		uh i'm kind of addicted to Headline News and C-SPAN and CNN so i get it from everywhere i guess but most of the details from the newspapers
 	
 	
 		yeah sounds like it
 		yeah a lot of people uh don't get any newspapers and you're getting two that's uh definitely kind of shows your interest in it
 	
 	
 		yeah  um
 	
 	
 		so do you do that for uh because um the morning journal paper is got more of uh a liberal or type bias
 	
 	
 		oh pretty much uh yeah i you know it in terms of the choice between the Journal and the Constitution i'd take the Journal because it carries more of the conservative columnists
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and also
 		didn't want to take two morning papers and since since i live in Gwinnete County i want to take the Daily News to get their Gwinnete coverage and it doesn't make sense to take two papers in the morning
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		taking the journal in the afternoon means you're get some of the some of the news up until their deadline which is about eleven or eleven AM or noon uh which you wouldn't get uh until the next day with the Constitution
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		so the uh Gwinnete paper that's owned by uh is it Wall Street Journal
 	
 	
 		well New York Times
 	
 	
 		New York Times okay
 	
 	
 		and uh so
 		
 
 		it's kind of strange they they're they're they're generally uh fairly conservative but some of the columnist they they publish are from the New York Times syndicate and from other newspapers owned by the New York Times
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it's
 		uh they tend to be really
 		uh really liberal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and i i i actually think probably uncharacteristic for Gwinnete County but it it's still interesting to hear or to to read uh you know different perspective on issues
 	
 	
 		um-hum so this something that you do uh just for your own personal interest it doesn't have anything to do with your job you're not in a job where you need to keep up on these current events
 	
 	
 		well i do keep up on current events in the high tech industry particularly data communications for my job but uh main reason i keep i keep up on current events is because of my interest in politics
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm you know active in politics and uh uh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		you going to run for elected office
 	
 	
 		well i ran for State Representative in the election in nineteen ninety and running for probably going to run for State Labor Commission this year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kind of ambitious but
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good how did you do in you your first uh run election
 	
 	
 		well i um i i was i run as a Libertarian and uh it was a three way race i got eight percent of the vote which is not bad for a third party in a three way race
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah for a third party right
 		yeah and you probably uh you know more and more people are probably leaning toward that third party now the way things are going
 	
 	
 		well i hope so the way  that's becoming pretty clear that the other two aren't doing that great of a job
 	
 	
 		huh
 		right hum
 	
 	
 		so where do you get your news
 	
 	
 		uh i guess newspapers uh i get i subscribe to the morning  um the Constitution um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		publication uh journal publication for uh i guess that would be more of keeping up in terms of the work that i do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		magazines US News and World Report Time magazine uh a lot of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i subscribe to several magazines too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah and you know things like Sports Illustrated uh computer magazines uh uh i don't know if you read the National Review
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i subscribed to it at one time um but there was a period uh
 		where i really felt that i was reading too much now now now i've got four kids and a fifth on the way now and it's hard to find time to read as much as i did
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh wow
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i've cut my monthly magazines back to just uh oh i guess three or four
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		things like uh uh Reason which a lot of people don't even they don't even know what it is it's a it's a Libertarian magazine but it's uh has a lot to do with uh free markets and privatization and things of that nature
 	
 	
 		i i don't know what that is no
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh the Freeman which is another uh Libertarian uh more of a philosophical uh type journal rather than a uh news sort of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh oh a couple of others but uh i don't tend to subscribe to the the major news magazines or things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum so uh what you're in the you're an engineer
 	
 	
 		yeah i work for uh uh
