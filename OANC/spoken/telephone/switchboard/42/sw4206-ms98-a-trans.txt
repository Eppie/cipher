 
     		
 	
 		how do you fill about drugs testing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		will i'm sorry i have i had mixed fillings about it um
 		at originally i thought all man i'm all for it totally then you know and then um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh after i got to thinking about it after it's been around a while now i think well it's there's
 		you know uh
 		maybe it not quite should not be quite as a as wide spread as i as i use to think it should be you know maybe in certain depends on the job really you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i happen to work uh in a medical profession and uh i work at a hospital and i think that's a good one that that it should be required at you know i myself wouldn't mind taking it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i do also believe there are times when um you you can come out on the bad end of the stick you know uh because of it
 	
 	
 		well yeah i'm i'm more of the uh
 		i'm kind of more against it than i am for it i i think that people i think people should more be they should be judge on you know their performance and i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i guess it kind of seems to me that's it kind of a
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the positive you the test type thing that you know people should pay attention to how there employees are you know the supervisors
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right and then
 	
 	
 		should keep an eye on them i i think that should be the the deciding factor in um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah well i agree with that to i mean if you can if there is a reason you might think you need to check them maybe so but um if there doing good performance if i had a good record yeah that's a good point you know why why should you
 	
 	
 		
  
 		and
 		it also kind of i mean
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i don't know it it kind of frighten me in in one way because it it seems like it's um
 		it's kind of a personal you know your
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 	
 	
 		checking you know your body and everything and if if they can if they can you know do a do a drug test you know they can
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right and um
 		really really where what's the next step you know yeah and uh cause myself i drink and uh you i'm i'm sure that you know when will they
 	
 	
 		you you know get get away with testing other things yeah exactly
 		yeah
 		i mean that's a drug as well it's just
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true and what's what's really the difference there alcohol is worst than a lot of drugs that they might uh consider illegal you know  and um but they um uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's true
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i mean i know in alcohol i mean if you if you drink the night before and what if you have the test the next day maybe that will be the next step is alcohol testing you know breath analyzers or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well right now with a with air line pilots and stuff i i now my stepfather works for Northwest Airlines and they had a
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		a thing a a while back and he knew one of the guys that got in trouble for i guess he had gone out the night before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		had had to much to drink and you are not suppose to drink within
 		i think i think it's like twelve hours or twenty four i know there's a certain
 	
 	
 		uh-huh before they go a back on there jobs
 	
 	
 		yeah before before they get back on the job and and he had been been within that time period
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's that's yeah i know it's
 	
 	
 		they got they came down on on him hard for that
 	
 	
 		i'm sure he did and he was probably perfectly capable you there was nothing at all that he couldn't have done you know as far as his job
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah it just change it vary so much from person person to person is  it's a subjective type thing
 	
 	
 		you know
 		that's true that's true
 		yeah and uh i mean i never thought about it but you know you may drink and uh drink a hole lot one night and you may be going out going somewhere the next day like Sunday afternoon and you you be perfectly fine all over again and uh if they did a test on you you might not pass
 	
 	
 		you never know
 	
 	
 		you know just just from the night before and um you know that's that's sort like the drugs testing you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and it it seems there there are a lot of profession now it seems like
 		um you know am sure the president of the United States doesn't get drug tested but he's got a lot of responsibilities and
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		uh as as seems like you know some things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if there are going to do it
 		you know like i know a lot of government
 		um jobs are
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's true yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		require drug testing
 		you know
 		it seems like they should uh not
 	
 	
 		right i know what you are saying
 	
 	
 		be you know they should not be hypocritical about it
 	
 	
 		that's right if you know um if you know if they're going to do it just do it totally nation wide every job there is you know or or else you know just don't do it
 	
 	
 		they having such a big problem with the
 	
 	
 		i mean it makes good sense
 	
 	
 		the drug war anyway its
 	
 	
 		yeah really i mean that's where the real problem is
 		i mean um but where i work uh i think they have talked about it you know and uh but nothing like that has come up at all you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		am surprise they they don't work i work for uh Georgia Tech Research Institute i'm a student employee and they have got a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know we work on a lot of government project and stuff but um but you know some of them require
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean some people are working with some kind of classified information but non of that i  think
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but uh they don't require any type of testing there and i remember i was in uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i was in the Air Force for uh a little while and they had a random type thing going
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so every i mean every i mean i'm a rejoining basic trainer or
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right right
 	
 	
 		just one mourning like every one from you know this
 		flight or what every would be tested
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		it's kind of a random thing
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but then i know of some other jobs
