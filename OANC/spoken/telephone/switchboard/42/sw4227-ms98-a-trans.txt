 		yep
 	
 	
 		what kind of dog
 	
 	
 		it's uh half Border Collie and half Lab
 	
 	
 		is it a house dog
 	
 	
 		half Border Collie
 	
 	
 		no i mean is it a house dog mean do you keep it in the house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep it's
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		it's uh and you'd think he's an uh little poodle
 	
 	
 		a little poodle
 	
 	
 		he's about eighty pounds though
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i've just the opposite i've got a Pomeranian he probably weighs about five
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he thinks he's a little man
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he's a little he presses around and struts
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but i don't have a cat though that might be a little bit too much
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you keep the dog and the cat both in the house
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		yeah they get along
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah they get along real good oh the dog was brought up with cats so he doesn't really bother the cats
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		well now the little kitten picks on him all the time
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yep
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well how old is the dog
 	
 	
 		uh let's see uh about seven eight years old
 	
 	
 		goodness mine's only i guess three
 	
 	
 		and
 		and our cat's only about two years old
 	
 	
 		well um what made you get a dog and a cat
 	
 	
 		well uh we both we've had cats and dogs before you know before we even got married so
 		i kind of like cats and she likes dogs so  yep
 	
 	
 		so you compromised
 	
 	
 		so we've had them oh at one time we had two dogs and two cats
 	
 	
 		goodness
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well i got my dog little dog to keep me company and now i'm hardly ever at home
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so now it's like whenever you come in he's all over you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well ours does that the company when we get it
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		yeah it's like a new face
 	
 	
 		yep
 		uh
 	
 	
 		something i guess like just something new and different
 	
 	
 		oh yeah he he's pretty he's real friendly
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		but but when somebody knocks at the door he's his barks
 		is real uh you know like he's a real bad dog
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		when you come in the house and he
 		he'd probably show the burglars where everything was at
 	
 	
 		thinks i think that Brian would probably do the same thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well i've heard that um pets are like to to people that are sick or to older people that they're have like calming effects on them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've heard that too
 	
 	
 		especially i guess if they have like high blood pressure or
 		um like heart conditions it just kind of helps to have a little or a dog or a cat or something around just to lavish the attention on it kind of calms them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i know i think it helps them too when they take them out for walks and stuff especially dogs you know plus they're uh the dog's a good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		good uh way to protect your house too when you're gone
 	
 	
 		uh that's true
 	
 	
 		you know like i said he barks a lot when somebody rings knocks on the door or rings the doorbell so it kind of keeps people away
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they think twice about breaking in
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um
 		trying there's something i was going to tell you and i forgot just totally went out the window
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but our little our little kitty he she uses uh
 		she's pretty cute little the wife got her when
 		she she was a stray and uh it bit her and so she had to bring it home with her to see if she got rabies or anything
 	
 	
 		and then y'all decided to keep it
 	
 	
 		yep so
 	
 	
 		isn't that funny how there's always a story behind something
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that's basically how she got the dog too
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well do you have names that are appropriate with more or less how you found them or how you got them or anything or
 	
 	
 		well well not really
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we uh the dog's name is Morgan
 		and the cat's name is Oscar Anne
 	
 	
 		Oscar Anne well that's a new one
 	
 	
 		yeah well well see at first they thought that the cat was a a boy
 		so they called her Oscar until the found out she was a girl so they just called her Oscar Anne
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so that's
 		uh that's the name there and uh how we got the dogs was we were stationed in England and
 		she went to some we had a dog and she took it to dog obedience school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and this farmer was gonna kill these six puppies they had and
 		she kind of said well i'll kind of i'll take one of them off your hands
 		
 
 		and that's how we got Morgan
 	
 	
 		Lord did you have a problem naming um coming up with names for them
 	
 	
 		i think uh well i didn't really come up with the name she did so
 	
 	
 		it took me like three weeks to name mine because i kept saying well i wan t to find a name that fits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i actually had for a couple of days had started calling
