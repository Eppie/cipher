 
     		
 	
 		all right well i've been to a couple we've uh we just had one recently for my mom's birthday that all the kids got together
 	
 	
 		all right
 		uh-huh
 		where was that
 	
 	
 		in in Wyoming Sundance
 	
 	
 		where in Wyoming
 		oh i've been through Wyoming but and uh
 		i uh when uh on our way to Montana so that's a bit sure is pretty country up there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and we just kind of we kept uh kind of uh it was a surprise birthday party for her was what it was
 	
 	
 		wow how old was she
 	
 	
 		sixty five
 	
 	
 		oh i bet she just uh was pleased
 	
 	
 		oh yeah she
 		she didn't know what was going on or anything
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but my dad had a knew uh what was going on but she didn't and
 		several people in town knew what was going on but they never did tell her so
 	
 	
 		uh that's uh that's that's quite a feat to be able to do that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah because we figured somebody'd probably tell her sooner or later
 	
 	
 		relatively small community it uh it would be pretty easy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it
 	
 	
 		so how many folks were up there
 	
 	
 		well we just had uh just immediate family just uh the kids and uh
 	
 	
 		grandkids
 	
 	
 		yeah my well what it was was just
 		huh let's see it was uh just my sisters me and my mom and dad and then uh our kids'
 	
 	
 		oh neat
 	
 	
 		so uh it was pretty good
 	
 	
 		well i bet
 		did you take a lot of pictures
 	
 	
 		yeah we even had some video taken so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		got all the big eyes and surprises huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		we had a surprise party uh for uh for my mom once and uh she they're in they're in Lubbock
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		she has uh
 		oh about eight or nine grandkids and we
 		hid them all through a friend's house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh she walked in the room and all of a sudden these grandkids started popping up out of furniture and behind doors and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she just uh was speechless for about fifteen or twenty minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really caught her off guard it's it's really fun to have a
 		have a have uh that sort of uh
 		surprise to family members
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah do you have a lot of family in Fort Worth
 	
 	
 		oh no it's it's me and my wife and son
 	
 	
 		oh how uh  are you where's your wife from
 	
 	
 		she's from San Antonio
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh that uh that's quite uh
 		quite a spread to get uh
 		everybody together it's hard now and days actually
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well we go to you know we go to San Antonio a lot to be with them during like Thanksgiving or Christmas so
 	
 	
 		unless
 	
 	
 		that's kind of our family reunions with them
 	
 	
 		now we uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we have our uh our side of the family really is pretty spread out so we we're we have to uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have a reunion maybe every other year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we all uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh gather uh
 		uh at a place just north of Austin which is fairly convenient for everybody we've got folks from El Paso to
 		Waco to Houston to Dallas so that uh uh
 		trying to trying to make it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh make everybody work a little bit i guess that's the deal that way no one feels like they're being
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah make everybody feel like well you're not at just one person's house so you don't really have to  you kind of all stay in in motels and stuff
 	
 	
 		taken advantage of
 		
 
 		yeah one of the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		one one of the rules is that if you're not at the reunion you have to plan the next one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's a pretty
 	
 	
 		so that's that's worked out that that that that brought a lot of people
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i never thought of that that'd probably work
 	
 	
 		well that uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it it uh it's been successful so far and you know we after the reunion it's uh it's so funny because you'd say well uh we ought to do this twice a year we had so much fun and it it it's too bad you can't
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know used to be i guess with uh family reunions where they just sort of came in from the surrounding towns uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh it was a lot easier but now and days we've
 		got people scattered all over the country and it's
 		that's really tough
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to get folks together
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's not they don't want to but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's that's the problem with us i'm down here and
 		and then i have a sister in New York City
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and then the rest of my sisters live right around Sundance
 	
 	
 		what brought you uh down from Wyoming
 	
 	
 		uh i'm in the service
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i'm in the Air Force so that kind of
 	
 	
 		how we uh
 		we used to live in Fort Worth actually and
 		we lived over by Carswell and i just love watching those planes come by
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's it's really pretty
 	
 	
 		well i just before i came here i was stationed in Lubbock
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i was there for four years and then i got down here
