 
     		
 	
 		uh consumer products and you have you ever recently uh returned returned anything recently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well most recently the kinds of things i've been returned actually are uh are
 		parts of you know repair parts
 	
 	
 		repair parts for cars or something
 	
 	
 		uh oh for for cars or for plumbing parts that kind of thing actually surplus parts that you know you need you think you need it and uh
 		want to make sure you've got everything you need and taking things back and so uh other than that uh you know i haven't had an opportunity where i've needed to return something due to uh poor service or you know failure of it
 		uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i guess
 	
 	
 		nope
 		no lemons huh
 	
 	
 		no no i guess well the closest thing we did have is couple weeks ago uh starter on our daur daughter's car failed
 		and so i had to uh try and find a replacement on a Sunday which in south  is not very easy we don't have a whole lot of Sunday shopping for those kinds of things and uh
 		and actually then it ended up with needing to found the parts but then
 		there were some recent very recent repairs on the starter done
 		and uh so my daughter took it back to the
 		repair shop that did the work for her hundred and forty miles from here and they gave her money back right away
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		presented you know tried to present a sound case for
 		defective equipment and
 		everything went very well
 	
 	
 		that's a long way to go
 	
 	
 		usually doesn't
 		yeah well she's going to school there right now so  you know she was headed back there so
 		certainly wouldn't make an extra trip for fifty dollars for a hundred miles but
 		uh she was headed back there so
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		worked out well how about yourself you had any recent uh experiences where with products that you've had to return
 	
 	
 		well it's been difficult i don't know i haven't really returned anything because there's a lot of
 		inertia to get through that process
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um uh actually no i have tried to get it fixed for example i've had a
 		i guess a uh a VCR
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		it was uh brand new
 		and uh pretty pretty top of the line type of VCR and i had problems with it uh recording uh things
 		uh something it would it was strange uh you can fast forward play through it and you'd see this uh picture on there
 		but if you played it normal it would go in and out uh between uh blue program screen and the actual
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		thing that was being recorded it was very bizarre
 		and the maintenance said it was due to weak signals
 		i'm saying well you know i'm paying this a lot of money for this uh
 		VCR and you're telling me just because it hasn't doesn't have a
 		you know a strong enough signal it'll do this
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that's strange because if it's if it's not strong enough then why is it that when you uh go slow motion or freeze frame or fast forward through it you can see the picture but
 		when it uh you play it normal it goes in and out that's very bizarre to me
 		and uh i have the worst time trying to just get him look at this problem and it ends up that they you know they just uh concluded that's that's all that's wrong with it and that's nothing nothing nothing wrong with the product and i said
 	
 	
 		at the yeah  well that's i guess that's one of the frustrations you end up talking with people that uh you know
 	
 	
 		just great
 	
 	
 		think they have considerable knowledge and uh you're not really convinced that they do and you almost end up bringing a third party in that uh you have trust in their competence
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		now it's not my position to advise and i don't have that  experience with it certainly sounds like a bill of goods trying to be sold to you
 	
 	
 		well i don't know it's uh it's hard to say it's there's there's nothing i could it didn't seem like there was much i could do about it
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't know if it's really getting better or worse um in that case  it didn't really get any better
 	
 	
 		you know or you know um i guess in situations like that are there other manufacturers or other companies that uh you can consult
 	
 	
 		uh
 		no i don't know
 	
 	
 		you know like a similar product somebody that sells a similar product and say
 		this you know am i getting the right kind of story here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well a lot of them probably say they don't know anything about it  i don't know it just a lot of them give you the line uh you know we have repair car repair's the same problem
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		things like that uh with all the electronics in the cars say but say say it gets a lot better gas mileage and
