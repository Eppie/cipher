 
     		
 	
 		okay um
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i guess i'm not real familiar with recycling because i've been in the army for twenty years so uh
 	
 	
 		oh you're an environmental engineer's dream
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right so uh actually the first my first encounter with it was at the the place we were originally renting uh which was a small community near here and they
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		they gave each household one of these plastic
 		uh bins or whatever to put our our stuff in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh then when we moved into the townhouse where we are now
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		there there again there was no recycling program and now there is
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and uh so we
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		we're recycling uh all the cans the glass bottles all the plastic and the newspapers which
 	
 	
 		that's great i really feel like uh community sponsorship is going to be one of the keys to uh recycling success
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um i know here we have in my community now we're i'm in unincorporated i'm in the county by i'm unincorporated
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh within a certain city limits there's there's more uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh more i i i just want to say better programs here we have uh trash pickup twice a week and on the first day they'll pickup aluminum cans and on the second they'll pick up newspapers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and um i think those are you know the kind of the core
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		crops if you will just to because they're the most uh lucrative i think and the most uh technologically feasible to recycle
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh
 		
  
 		right
 		ours our regular trash pickups are also twice a week but then the recycling pick up is totally separate and that's on Thursday
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh are is is your community recycling sponsored by your local government
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		
  
 		um-hum yeah it's just a small town and it's uh it's locally sponsored
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i don't know what they do with it uh that always
 		uh
 		uh interested me as to where it goes and what they do with it to to process it but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah there're a lot of different ways to recycle you can um especially with the plastics you can melt them down and reform them or you can actually recycle them and it depends on whether they segregate the different types of plastics there're seven main types
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		hm now i i kind of came up with an idea as well on my own in that
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i think part of the recycling responsibility falls
 		uh not only with the local or county governments but with the individuals as well
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because uh the individual family is capable of recycling things that never have to be delivered to somebody else to to be recycled
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and so i've kind of looked for because i'm interested in gardening which is an ideal uh vehicle for recycling i've looked for those things that i can recycle
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		that i can use with my uh organic gardening that uh i like to do yeah and so what for example  what i do is uh
 	
 	
 		oh you do organic gardening
 		
  
 	
 	
 		recycle the grass clippings and all the leaves that uh not only that i rake but uh that all my neighbors rake up for me  it's uh
 	
 	
 		oh how wonderful you're doing so well
 	
 	
 		it's neat that they uh they will rake it up for me off of their own yards bag it for me and put it on the curb for my easy collection  and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		right
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so then i just uh get as much as i need
 		which sometimes embarrasses my wife  she says please don't pickup their grass clippings and i uh take it into the backyard or in this case wherever i can and compost it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		see and then i can recycle that right into the garden and uh i
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah that's wonderful i'd love i'm i have
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		tried not too diligently to get involved with that organic gardening composting i have two dogs and they would eat every bit of compost i'd put out there and i fenced it off with chicken wire about two or three feet high
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		hm
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they'd jump over the wire just to eat the little egg shells and potato peels and just whatever they could put their little jaws on it was awful
 	
 	
 		
  
 		really
 		so you you have dogs that are vegetarians huh gee that's odd
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah people people say it's just part of my Karma i'm not a complete vegetarian as a matter of fact i've got some corn beef on the stove right now but i uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		hm
 		
  
 		oh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		don't eat much meat or as much as i used to but my dogs since i've been eating more produce
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		eat more produce anyway
 	
 	
 		
  
 		they they do to huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's odd i'd never heard of dogs eating
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh vegetable leftovers or anything like that huh because one of the things that they say about compost uh if you make it from grass and leaves and
 	
 	
 		yeah they'll
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		fruits and vegetable leftovers or scra pses that uh it does not attract animals
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		um because there's no meat in it or anything or fish or anything like that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		that's interesting that you have dogs that are attracted to compost well they guess they'll be healthy dogs
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		yeah  well with my luck they'll live forever huh
 	
 	
 		right so i uh i do that and then the other thing that i try and do along the same lines is uh because i like to start my own seedlings
 	

 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i look at what
 		i can do with the some of the plastic containers that we have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that i can use in the gardening
