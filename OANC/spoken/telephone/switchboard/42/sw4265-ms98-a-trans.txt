 
     		
 	
 		a loaded question what do you think about gun control
 	
 	
 		
 
 		Rick
 		well as a person living in one of the areas that's got both the uh one of the most restrictive set of laws and one of the uh highest murder rates in the uh country
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i happen to be an opponent of gun control
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i happen to be um
 		kind of funny of course i had a radical turn around in my attitude about that about four or five years ago
 		and um along with some other political uh what do you call it um
 		changes too i formerly was one of your typical New York left wingers
 	
 	
 		that you know that's what i suspected
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		talking to a New Yorker i thought that i'd hear someone who was totally for gun control
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well we're not all like that um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		about a year ago i engaged in the arduous six month prices process of getting a fire arms license
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		and um
 		not long after that my wife engaged in a similar process and now when we get a chance which is entirely too infrequently we can go down to the range and shoot together
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i used to do a lot of that it it can be a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		all right where you are you can go to Sears right
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		really yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not i'm i'm not sure about Sears but i know the sporting goods stores and i know Sears used to sell guns i just i'm aggravated with Sears right now
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you know the stores the stores are here but it's you know you walk in and i'd like to look at that okay fine let me see your paperwork
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh it's kind of funny because um we are going out to California in a while and uh out there you can walk into apparently there are ranges where they rent which is something that to me is completely foreign
 	
 	
 		bet
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah i may get a chance to try out some things i've never tried out before
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i grew up in New Mexico and you know guns were a fact of life
 	
 	
 		ah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh my granddad hunted and what not you you mentioned uh
 		uh that you've gotten the fire arm permit is this for a hand gun or does are there uh there are the laws as restrictive for rifles and shot guns
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh for rifle and shotgun you've got to sign the federal form but that's about it
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		um and i really don't know where they stand on semiautomatics these days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they've been getting a lot of bad press
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		it's uh
 	
 	
 		well you know i guess i could summarize my feelings about it as that uh
 		i would like no restrictions on me and a total ban on most people
 	
 	
 		sounds fair
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		my ex-husband would choke if he heard me say that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you know it um you know it's kind of interesting you say that because we had a series about a year and a half ago
 		of murders here four within the space of about two months
 		and the profile of all of them was
 		a couple got separated the guy had menacing the his ex-wife
 		um they filed the court order to keep him away he got picked up once or twice and then the last time he didn't get picked up he just came in there and uh and killed the woman
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and there were four of these within a couple of months and nobody seems to connect with the idea that um
 		you know there are you know that maybe just maybe she could've uh had a better shot at it if um she'd been armed
 	
 	
 		literally yeah
 	
 	
 		you know at uh
 	
 	
 		and in all those cases were those murders by guns probably
 	
 	
 		um i don't think so i think that there made a strangulation or stabbing in there you know i don't know the specifics but um
 		you know it uh  what was that
 		oh my wife is screaming shotgun
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		either go get it or uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or what um
 		what do you call we had uh
 		friend of mine who would
 		maybe this is fundamentally my attitude changing
 		uh when he pointed out that the purpose of the police was not to prevent crime
 		and uh you know that's something we all actually  except that is the purpose of the police and i said what do you mean by that
 		and his comment was
 		well in order to prevent a crime the police have to be where the crime is taking place now they can't be everywhere they can be very good at deterring crime
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they can be very good capturing criminals and enforcing the punishment of crime but they can't be good at preventing it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so if the police aren't going to prevent it who is
 	
 	
 		i see
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh i thought it was you know um um a very nice elegant piece of logic there and it's absolutely true you know it
 		you know so and i imagine the more rural you get that the truer that is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know um kind of funny i was just looking at a book today where some fellow was screaming his his car had been stolen
 		and he was screaming at the police primarily because about two days before you know they were telling him we're spread to thin to enforce car theft and a few days before they'd given him a ticket for parking fifteen minutes late at a meter
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know  a matter of priorities i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah i can understand that
 	
 	
 		yeah but um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh are you a member of the NRA
 	
 	
 		as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		are you  recently
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		card carrying um it's about uh i think it was renewed for the second or third time
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		my ex was a long term member of the NRA
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's interesting of course one of the things that um
 		yeah i i don't know
