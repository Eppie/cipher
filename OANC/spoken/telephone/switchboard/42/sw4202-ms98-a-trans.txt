 
     		
 	
 		well Doug what are they doing in your community in Pennsylvania about recycling
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		well some stuff
 		i go to Penn State up here and the town recycles quite a bit actually they collect curbside
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		gone the day that the garbage goes
 		and they recycle um tin and aluminum cans and glass and newspaper basically
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so the the people have to separate it out is that
 	
 	
 		um
 		no actually the um garbage crew does that you just put a
 		you know plastic plastic recycling bin out on the curb every week and now except for having the paper bundled people don't really separate at all
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 		how about at Penn State do they recycle things like uh computer paper and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		um yeah they do although there's just recently been a problem with them
 		uh like saying that they weren't able to afford recycling everything anymore
 		so that they um they stopped recycling newspaper on campus for instance
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		they stopped recycling glass so they're only doing cans and white paper now
 		which i think is kind of insane
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because it's really not that expensive
 	
 	
 		well what i've uh learned about recycling is that it's almost impractical to recycle newspapers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which is sad
 		and and as a matter of fact i'm member of a civic organization where we had someone from the city of Dallas come talk to us about recycling and the whole key to recycling is demand
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the supply is there people are willing to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but for example until they figure out how they can strip the inks off of  used newspapers effectively cost effectively
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then it's not gonna happen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and there are whole huge warehouses in Dallas full of used newspapers
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i think they actually are building some sort of a plant in Texas where they can strip the ink off
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i see
 	
 	
 		i know at work we recycle white paper and cans like you said
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the city of Plano is actually doing quite a bit they recently started picking up um
 		glass aluminum and and they will take newspapers too
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and it apparently doesn't have to be sorted they haven't quite reached my neighborhood yet but they're doing all sorts of smart things uh
 	
 	
 		i see
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they no longer allow grass clippings to be bagged up in plastic bags and put out by the trash
 	
 	
 		um yeah that's definitely good
 	
 	
 		yes if you want to bag you know if you if if you don't want the clippings left on your lawn you can bag them in biodegradable bags which means paper
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which you can buy from the city
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and they're great until it rains and then they start biodegrading
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but they are uh contracting with someone to turn all these clippings into mulch
 	
 	
 		oh  that's great
 	
 	
 		and i don't know whether i don't know whether it'll be available to the to the citizens of the town or whether it will just be used in the parks and recreation department or something i i don't know i guess it really doesn't matter
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but
 		it's uh
 		uh since they won't take any yard waste it's that's in plastic bags it's a little bit annoying when you're you know pulling up your vegetable garden at the end of the season and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you don't have any of the their special paper bags on hand because you haven't bagged your clippings at all you just let them recycle themselves
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i she see
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh i don't i this for a rather small town well hundred thousand people or so i guess this pretty progressive community
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh is it happening much in towns like it in Texas
 	
 	
 		um
 		i don't know about statewide i think i think in the Dallas area there are few other uh suburbs Plano's a suburb that uh are doing things about recycling
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it in order for it to be cost effective you have to have customers for it you have to have people say i won't have i won't buy paper unless it's recycled
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right because
 	
 	
 		i mean
 	
 	
 		right the plan of the state college originally was that the recycling would pay for itself and all that and the people's garbage rates would actually go down and of course if hasn't happened that way
