 
     		
 	
 		well i have a a couple of of of small children
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		one is four uh the other one's an infant
 		and when we were looking for care for the older child when he was about nine weeks or so
 		i uh i i had to go back to work i wanted to find someplace with a very uh low ratio of of children to to care giver
 		so that the so that my infant could could really receive a lot of attention
 		and
 		for that first couple of of years i was able to find that in in a family setting
 		uh  uh a a day care provider offering services out of her own home
 		but her circumstances circumstances changed and she lost the the help that she had uh so that they were really now quite a number of of demands on her time
 		and we switched over to to a uh a commercial day care service
 		which actually is the best of of both worlds it's it's not a a big chain and they do have separate rooms for the the different developmental ages so it
 		the the youngest one now the the the new infant still receives personalized care
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh but at the same school his his older brother is receiving uh basically pre kindergarten
 		care
 	
 	
 		my situation is a little bit different but it still covers the same type of problem
 		i am a grandmother but i'm also employed but my grandson and his father moved back in and lived with us for about a year
 		and so and he was about four
 		so it was sort of like another generation raising a a a child and we're all working adults
 		so it i have some of the same problems it's no longer a problem now that he is older and in school but this has been a problem no matter what generation you're in
 		and one of the things that and then also in the setting where i work i see a lot of uh young people especially uh young women with children
 		who have to take time off because of problems with the babysitting or child care services
 		and i think uh one of the things that and also when i had the grandson my grandson here that we were keeping care of him
 		one of the main problems that affects work and affects the care too is when you're as any when the child is the least bit sick
 		uh uh the you have to come get them there's a problem and one of the things i would like to see would be a type of day care service
 		where there is uh at the same place where they're care for as a well child they have facilities for uh sick care
 	
 	
 		i i i know i i've had the problem myself where the child might might begin to run a a low grade fever
 		and the school calls up and says come get your come get your child uh your child looks like maybe he has conjunctivitis come get your child immediately whether or not
 	
 	
 		come get him
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's really true uh come get your child immediately uh it and that's it's it is a big disruption uh it's particularly bad in the first year if you're back to work and
 		you know how frequently that you have to go to the doctor for the little ones just for checkups alone in the first year
 		uh sometimes your boss doesn't think that that's
 		really terrific
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		but you have to take time off and and go take your child to to well baby care on top of that now the the general cold and sniffles and and the first year illnesses
 		and the school doesn't want to want to keep your child
 		we do have up here um and some of the hospitals do this as a way of defraying their costs they run day cares for sick children
 		out of their hospital facilities but
 	
 	
 		well that's an interesting yeah
 	
 	
 		that it and it's it's an interesting way to approach it but there's a problem
 		i don't know how many parents would be willing to take their children
 		to a a a location a child has never seen
 	
 	
 		oh that's that's another reason why i would preferred it to be with the same services
 		the facility that i work with is a large facility and they're looking at day care now and i would love to see day care on site
 		where if you have lunch you can go over and spend it with a child
 		uh if you have and i would like a twenty four hour day care and it's big enough where it could do that
 		where if you worked different shifts uh you could uh uh
 		bring the child in
 	
 	
 		and but yeah
 	
 	
 		for the night where you know they would be there with you and you can stop in at anytime on your break so that your the check and balances of the type of care is subject to anybody stopping in anytime
 	
 	
 		i i know we we would've liked to
