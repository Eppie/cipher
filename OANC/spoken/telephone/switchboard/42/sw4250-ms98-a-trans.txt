 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i run uh usually a couple of times a week um because i i'm at i'm a student at Rice University and so i can just sort of run a loop around the campus which is about three miles
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		and um that's sort of i guess it's probably the most common thing i do for exercise the other thing i do is um i try and play racquetball a couple of times a week with um a friend
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		Bill do you feel safe running across the campus
 	
 	
 		uh yeah actually if i do it uh certainly at night i feel i mean sorry not at night i feel perfectly safe at night i usually do it with someone else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well the area immediately north of you and immediately west of you is not a very good area
 	
 	
 		well let's see um north is sort of the meandrous area which is not uh it's not too bad as far as crime goes i think i mean it's not really great
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um south is the area that's really crime ridden that's sort of the south main area um
 	
 	
 		okay the south main yes okay i know what you're talking about
 	
 	
 		yeah so that that's not too great but the um i usually feel pretty safe around the campus itself uh the uh Rice has their own police department and they're pretty aggressive about
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well you've got pretty good fencing around your parameter parameter
 	
 	
 		no actually we don't we don't have fences it's just uh a tall hedge so
 	
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah it does  yeah at least it's a psychological barrier so
 	
 	
 		i know you have some separation because
 		my uh son went to Saint Thomas for uh a year and
 		and uh we drove over and looked at Rice with the reason we thought there might some possibilities of of changing but
 		anyway uh i was very impressed with the campus
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really it's a pretty a beautiful campus especially considering it's in the middle of the ugly city like Houston but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh my exercise program i used i did run
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh for several reasons i now do mostly walking
 		uh one was that i had a knee injury i stepped in a
 		in a crack or a whole twisted my knee and it was very painful
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the other is i'm getting older now so it makes more sense to walk than it does to run
 	
 	
 		yeah i can um
 		one of the reasons i run uh probably the biggest reason either run or play racquetball i mean either of them is um because if i don't get exercise i don't i don't sleep well and i just don't feel as good i just feel kind of yucky
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well the emotional the emotional benefits of running are almost as good as the physical benefits i use it as stress relief
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that too i mean uh the um
 		but the reason why i noticed you were talking about walking i i don't if i walk i'd have to walk like ten miles i think to you know for it to really sort of get the same benefit as running if i run uh really hard
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		
  
 		um-hum that's true
 	
 	
 		and that that may just be that may just be me or you know whatever i'm sure i'm sure when i get older i'll probably i'll be more of a workout but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		well i walk forty five i walk forty five to fifty minutes
 	
 	
 		that's pretty good yeah
 	
 	
 		which is uh between two and three miles at a at a fairly comfortable  uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the last time i was doing an aggressive running program i was in graduate school about um
 		oh it's i guess it's been ten years ago now but uh anyway i was doing i was running three miles
 		a day five times a week and that
 	
 	
 		wow that that that's a fair amount that's more than i do by a considerable amount
 	
 	
 		well that was that was because i was in graduate school and i was doing about a sixty hour week
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i had to do all this to play it you know to get things under control
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah no i understand that i mean i i sometimes you know feel like uh well one reason another another reason why i run rather than do something like walk is uh it takes a long time
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		because it's sort of the same work out but but yeah i can  i sort of you know am able to you know sleep better and and be more uh more alert um when i'm you know when i am awake if i if i exercise regularly so it really
 		it's kind of like an investment that pays off
 	
 	
 		i've never tried the handball do you find that helps you a lot
 	
 	
 		well i mean it's kind of it's it's you know it's good exercise especially when you get good at it because you the idea is to make the other player run to where he's not i mean you hit the ball it's kind of like tennis in that sense but you're not chasing always chasing after the ball um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes i
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but uh the reason why i do like that a little bit better than running if i can find uh you know people to play with because it's more it's more interesting i mean there's you know like a game aspect to it as well as just sort of the exercise
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		and as long as you keep moving you have the aerobic effect and i i'm sure if you have a  half way good player you do keep running
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		yeah oh yeah
 		yeah yeah and it took a little it took a little while to to get good i mean the first you know i don't know two or three weeks of playing uh you know to i didn't really get that great of work out but but it now i it's pretty good
 	
 	
 		um-hum i used to uh years ago play tennis but again uh as you get older tennis is pretty rough on the knees i'm sure handball would be also
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah i can i can understand knee problems because i've found i haven't had trouble with it this year but in past years when i've you know done only running and not racquetball um my
 	
 	
 		um-hum
