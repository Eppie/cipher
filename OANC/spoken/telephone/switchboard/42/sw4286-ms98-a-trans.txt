 
     		
 	
 		talk about home repairing i understand
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		did have you had any recent experience
 	
 	
 		well i'm not a home owner but i consider myself to be pretty handy uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		well i'm sure you are mean usually are
 	
 	
 		but i don't
 		i don't uh i don't uh
 		it's kind of uh it's kind of a hard thing to to talk about having a limited experience base i mean i fix things around here rather than uh rather than bother a landlord with it i'll you know repair a sink or um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		actually i fixed our water bed that was pretty handy but  but how about you
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well i had an experience uh this summer as a matter this past summer hm not this and what happened  was that my closet rod fell down
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i went into the closet
 		and this closet is probably fifteen feet long
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and all my clothes were on the floor and i said oh my word  oh yes they're very heavy
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		and they're heavy too you don't think about how heavy it is
 	
 	
 		and um
 		so i i thought now because i'm alone and i said now who am i going to get to do this because i sure don't i wouldn't
 		i know one end of the hammer from the other one but that's about it i wouldn't know how to address a nail properly at all
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i scoured the little paper that we get in the neighborhood and i found uh
 		uh a handyman and he said that he was an ex-teacher and i thought well he sounds like the kind of caliber that i would not be too leery of and i called him and
 		he did a marvelous job and i and i got to know him pretty well and i said uh he said Catherine he says if you
 		this house will fall down but these closet these close rods will not fall down  he says that's how good they're in there he says i guarantee this for life
 	
 	
 		hm yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that really pleased me and he did a marvelous he did a fantastic job and he also uh replaced my door in my garage uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i had been robbed uh the year before and um
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		they wanted to charge me six hundred dollars to replace the side door and i thought no you're not i'm not paying six hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		six hundred dollars
 		American money
 	
 	
 		American money
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and Ken did it for me for like two hundred and thirty dollars
 		and he gave and he gave me a solid core door and
 		you know i just said i knew that i would find somebody that would do this at a price that was realistic
 		six hundred dollars for one single side door that's well he said well that's including labor and i thought okay Charlie i said that sounds silly
 	
 	
 		hm boy
 	
 	
 		very extreme
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a that was a good deal you got
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		actually it was a really bad deal that they they tried to give you i guess
 	
 	
 		yes it was well see they thought that they could prey on my uh recent loss that i would be in a panic to have this door fixed because that was the door that the intruders
 		broke through but but the insurance company had made it so that nobody could get in because they put two by fours over it and nailed it shut
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah that's kind of yeah that would
 	
 	
 		and uh so i mean
 		if they wanted to get in they would have had to use a mac truck to get through the bars
 	
 	
 		and hey i'm sure someone probably if they if they were interested they would have you know that
 	
 	
 		yeah well they you know the insurance adjuster said if if they are bent on getting your house they'll they'll they'll plow through your brick
 	
 	
 		yep they won't stop it
 	
 	
 		uh he said there's not anything that's going to stop them if they're determined
 	
 	
 		the
 		they'll stop at nothing but i'm glad you got your home fixed that's that's important i i put up uh closet organizers one year and uh
 		uh i don't know if you're familiar with them up here they call them the California closets they're wire uh uh basically they subdivide your closets into all sorts of little nooks and crannies
 	
 	
 		oh i see they organize them oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah and shelves and so instead of having just a little one rod you have racks and shelves and stuff and you have uh rods but those are bi-level rods there's two sets upper and lower then sort of doubles the hanging space then
 	
 	
 		sure how how do you like that
 	
 	
 		oh they're great
 	
 	
 		oh wonderful
 	
 	
 		they're great and um you know they're
 	
 	
 		wonderful
 		so you can utilize all of your closet space by having those
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah and instead of having shoes or whatever on the floor and and things like that in your closet they have little shelves on the side that you can
 	
 	
 		that's wonderful
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you can still stack things on they have they have all sorts and uh you know they sell them in our the local home stores here and uh i'm sure that you can pick them up down there but it's a really uh the way they put them together it's really not hard at all to put them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		put them in it takes about an afternoon it was a Sunday afternoon you know and uh you lay it out and they give you little things that you mark uh on your wall tells you how to
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
