 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes uh i think a lot of the problems whether they be in school or in home in discipline has a part is rooted in the amount of time parents spend with their kids
 	
 	
 		yeah i i don't think parents spend enough time with their kids these days
 		i remember my parents used to help me with my homework and stuff like that you know make sure that i had
 		that i understood what i was trying to study and everything like that
 	
 	
 		now my parents were the same way uh they they took uh interests in everything that i did not just the things that interested them or when they felt like uh i wanted to spend time which was uh
 		uh when they wanted me get out get me out of the door to school in the morning
 	
 	
 		right  well we used to take family vacations which i always used to love we'd travel by car to all these different states and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh see these you know really nice things and they were not the typical things like Florida or Disneyland or whatever
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		was more like Colorado for the mountains or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's essentially what we did uh i look i came from the midwest and we went to the neighboring states to uh little known places that i have yet to find anyone else that's ever been to these places
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly i i'm from the midwest myself from Michigan and we'd we'd go as far as like oh
 		oh places like Colorado we went to Arkansas very frequently and  the the biggest thing was that the family did things together you know we didn't just like separate and go our separate ways when we got there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we'd always go out and do things and spend time with each other
 	
 	
 		yeah so i i used to babysit uh the neighbor's kids when i was a lot younger and um
 		it was essentially they'd they'd get home from work the parents would they stick the kids in front of the TV set until it was time to go to bed and never did anything as a family together
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep and the kids ended up the losers i think
 	
 	
 		yeah they they became uh brats and juvenile delinquents
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the parents just didn't want to really put the time and effort into uh uh
 	
 	
 		its
 	
 	
 		making them making a family unit it was like they were single but they're they were still a a a single people but uh they had kids
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		the kids were just a nuisance
 	
 	
 		they they got in the way they cost money and they get they're that's the attitude that a lot of people have these days and it's one of the reasons why the kids don't do well in school and don't
 		are carrying guns to school and stuff like that because they don't feel like anybody cares
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		and in some in a lot of cases uh very few or the only the uh only the wrong people care
 		the the people who should care don't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right that's correct
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um have have you uh have you uh worked around kids quite a bit
 	
 	
 		people at work
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		not directly huh
 	
 	
 		no no not not in recent years
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i haven't worked i haven't worked around kids too much either i used to live in a building that had a day care down in the basement
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'd go down there and play with some of the kids at times and it was really kind of enjoyable to just they you know they were younger like two and a half to five
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um it was enjoyable because they would they liked just liked being with people i mean it really didn't matter what you did with them as long as you did something with them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		oh you know let's play with the kitchen or or let's let's play with you know read me a book or you know do something
 	
 	
 		the only problem i had with that and i had i talked to another person who had the same thing when you start actually playing with them you take on the same uh
 		uh sometimes you take on the same mentality of like it's mine
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i said wait a minute wait a minute i i'm i'm beyond this and i'm acting just like they are
 	
 	
 		you
 		you speak in simple sentences huh
 	
 	
 		yeah all the words have one syllable
 	
 	
 		do you have a boo boo
 		that doesn't go across very well when you're uh talking to your coworkers
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do i have a what
 	
 	
 		you know a boo boo an owie
 	
 	
 		i think i'm going to go to the potty now
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh oh well it sounds like you and i have uh similar opinions on this topic
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's it's just uh parents today are it's they want everything if if it can't be done in five minutes don't bother me with it
 	
 	
 		yeah yep no attention no attention span
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then especially if it can't be solved in a half hour with ads in between you know
 	
 	
 		right it's the it's the television mentality all problems are created and solved in a half hour
 	
 	
 		yep
 		and uh then you go on to the next set of problems and solve them in a half hour too
 	
 	
 		yep well things just and therefore you have children that um
