 
     		
 	
 		oh sure i guess this sort of relevant for me because i'm a college student so you know i would have been affected by it you know a couple years ago i guess probably or after i graduate i don't know how it would be set up
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i have sort of mixed feelings about the whole thing i mean i think it would sort of be
 		uh sort of a bonding experience in a sense for people in the country and the you know people of of uh sort of all different uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know socioeconomic racial uh you know geographic even uh you know groups who would be mixed together and would sort of work together which i think would be a positive thing
 	
 	
 		that would be a good coming of age experience
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i you know i think i think that that that would be a very probably the most positive part of it
 		and you know it's also good to do uh to do volunteer work
 		but on the other side i sort of you know wonder whether or not the government uh would run a program like this intelligently i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a really big problem and that's my main objection to something like that today looking at uh the track record on um you know responsible management i'd really have to say that i think it'd be guaranteed that the government would have a real problem
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean the for example the Peace Corps has been a real success i think but the problem with that is that
 		uh you you know it's a it's a small program and i don't know whether they could find worthwhile work um for everyone in the country sort of uh and also you know and still still manage it well i think they might be tempted for example to
 		to not spend as much money as they should i mean they'd say look we have all this free labor let's not spend any money and so they would end up using people and their talents very inefficiently
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		yeah that is a big problem especially with organizations get bigger and bigger but there are a lot of little little problems like uh illiteracy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh some other things that could stand having some manpower thrown at it
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i think yeah again if it if the if it was used efficiently and people you know worked on on real problems as opposed to just sort of make work
 		then uh i think it could have very positive impact
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i just i haven't seen i haven't seen any of the detailed proposals for that i don't have you
 	
 	
 		no i have no idea
 	
 	
 		i mean i know people sort of floated the idea around but um
 		i don't really know that much about it
 	
 	
 		in the early eighties um for economic reasons and wanting money to go to school i went into the Marine Corps for four years and
 		the mismanagement and the waste there was really disgusting totally really disturbing
 		remember uh the first year that i paid a thousand dollars in federal income tax i watched that thousand dollars wasted that day
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		there were some radios that um had been sitting on a shelf and they had some schedule or every eight months they had to be checked whether they were used or not and that's a practical idea but before i left i saw those very same radios rotate through again
 		and they'd been through many times before
 		
 
 		items that have been contracted out and paid for and that that in the end hadn't been built to specifications all kinds of stuff like that that was really disturbing
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		for you know a big organization like that that a lot of people go off and do the kind of coming of age thing as well
 	
 	
 		yeah and the part of the problem i mean even even i think probably a little bit of the problem with the military is that you know people only stay for a few years a lot of the people and so there's not
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah and a lot of them want out because it's so disgusting
 	
 	
 		yeah and there but there's no sort of continuity to it i mean you don't have people that sort of feel responsible for uh you know the area they're working or whatever i think you'd have that problem even worse if people were only in for a year
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah a year's too short for any kind of continuity you're absolutely right
 	
 	
 		and they probably wouldn't
 		yeah and they and they probably wouldn't hire enough permanent personnel to really you know make the glue to keep the whole thing functioning well
 		um so i yeah i i don't know i mean i i think if if it could be made to work well it would be a good idea if it would just be sort of a giant waste of people's time
 		then i think it would be you know exactly that a waste of time and money
 	
 	
 		yeah i wish our generation had better memory of things like the uh the New Deal and all the things that went on then when Roosevelt had uh all kinds of people working in
 		they were getting paid but it was a uh you know building highways and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		yeah i do think i mean i do think that's that's one part of it you would have to pay people i mean
 	
 	
 		yep absolutely
 	
 	
 		and either that or you know sort of like the military i mean the military doesn't pay people very much but you know they provide housing or whatever i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah there's got to be enough compensation for you to survive for a year
 	
 	
 		yeah you've got to be able to you know to pay people to live more or less i mean you can't expect them
 	
 	
 		yeah this isn't the ancient Soviet army where you if you have the money you go in
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you need you need to uh you need to provide a way for people to live so for that reason alone it would be it would be expensive
 		um and so maybe that's almost one of the big drawbacks to it
 	
 	
 		yeah that and especially with the the things uh money running the way it is today and the federal
