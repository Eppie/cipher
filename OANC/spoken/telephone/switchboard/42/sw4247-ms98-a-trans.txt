 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well well i have a a a new puppy in this house it's been i've had her here about two weeks
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh well actually i put a dog of that i'd had for seventeen years to sleep about a month ago
 	
 	
 		you got any pets
 		oh that's too bad
 	
 	
 		yeah so that's uh
 		um i'm thinking about getting another one but i don't know in the mean time i have a cat that's uh nearly twenty pounds
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and the the vet assures me it he has a large bone structure so but  just a big old Tom
 	
 	
 		so we're still uh in the in the paper stage i guess if you put your seventeen year old dog away
 		while back you have it's been a long time since that was the case
 	
 	
 		yes oh what sort of puppy do you have
 	
 	
 		well it we took you know it's from a shelter it's a mix of uh
 		gee i guess uh uh
 		Shepherd and um and a
 		black Lab
 	
 	
 		oh those are the best kind
 	
 	
 		so it's going to be a monster
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that that's where i got uh
 		my dog was from the shelter and the idea was to get a Shepherd Lab mix and he
 		turned out to be about half that size
 		um
 		he he i just couldn't resist him at the shelter so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh he was
 		well he was at least eighteen when he died because
 		he was full grown when i got him
 	
 	
 		so you don't know how old he was when you got him
 	
 	
 		i really don't
 	
 	
 		huh
 		did you uh did you have him fixed or was he uh was he
 	
 	
 		he
 		he was fixed
 		his name was Randy
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		with uh  good cause
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh so i got him fixed
 	
 	
 		i guess that's a good plan he wasn't fixed when you got him though huh
 	
 	
 		but
 		no no
 		yeah i it's  uh i've never
 		um had an animal that long never
 		i was it was a hard thing to do
 	
 	
 		well
 		well he was real sick huh
 	
 	
 		he just was real arthritic uh and then just stopped eating
 		you know it was real it was real clear that you know it was it was time to go
 	
 	
 		oh
 		time times were over well that's a that's a that's a shame that
 	
 	
 		yeah but this uh well eventually i guess
 	
 	
 		so you going to get another one
 	
 	
 		eventually i i haven't yet
 		but they're a lot of work too
 	
 	
 		yes they are they are indeed
 	
 	
 		the the hardest part is the stage you have right now i think
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but you know but get little i got little kids and they they do a pretty good job of taking care of the dog and so forth so that'll be fun for them
 	
 	
 		oh i think pets are wonderful for kids
 		any
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		used to
 	
 	
 		teaches them responsibility and all that kind of stuff too  at least in theory
 	
 	

 		my kids could use it
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well you think that gives them uh the uh what what they're looking for here
 	
 	
 		but
 		well i i guess i um sometimes have been told
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in well yeah i guess that's fine
 		so thanks for calling talking
 	
 	
 		well it's nice to talk to you
 		good night now
 	
 	
 		good night
