 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well i i can tell you here's an interesting interesting story uh my wife uh when we first had our kids decided to home school our kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh it would is isn't that against well in in is that is is that within the law in Virginia
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah it's it's interestingly uh there're a couple of different categories categories of home school uh children
 		uh a lot of people take religious exemptions
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and those are the people you probably read about all the time in the news you know somebody's somebody's trying to you know get rid of evolution or something and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know so they don't want their kid to go to school to find out that you know the kid really comes out of the cabbage patch
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh  but in our case uh we actually did it uh we took uh educational you know whatever
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh because we both had advanced degrees and so we just said uh hey look you know we have enough education to to school our kids
 		and the idea was when we first started was to just do elementary school uh level instead of the public schools and do that at at home uh eight six uh eight seven and four
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		how old are your kids
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh so pretty young kids and so anyway my wife did all of this all of this schooling
 		and uh you know she had curricula that she bought that they actually sell which we never knew of um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it was really complete i mean uh it matched up pretty well with with uh actually matched i thought was better than a lot of the public school curricula but
 		anyway you know you could if you were really religious of course you could get all uh sort of a religious stuff with all the the creation and stuff slant on it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh there's actually a lot of uh to us anyway there's a lot of other good stuff out there too
 		so we got a couple actually bought a couple of these programs and for grades you know one through six
 	
 	
 		so like prefab school
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so you know went through it
 		and uh anyway my my wife got to the third grade point with my with my daughter
 	
 	
 		the four year old
 	
 	
 		and the oldest one the eight year old
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		got to the third grade point
 		and it was just too much i mean it was just the kids were just
 		you know they needed they just needed other kids to be learning with you know and uh also it was a tremendous amount of work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		sure i i imagine it it it it it really was because see you had to do run at least three curricula three separate curricula in parallel and uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly
 		now it was easier it was actually easier as the younger ones got older because she could just you know kind of take what she had before just the same the same thing that public school teachers do now i mean the
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it it was
 	
 	
 		how how long did you do this for
 	
 	
 		uh she did it for three years
 	
 	
 		three years okay
 	
 	
 		and and actually the kids did really you know uh if you if you believe the tests that uh the state hands out here you know they're supposed to test your uh your
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh so so every year your kids had to do like some kind of a test to be sure that okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right they took a standardized test and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they they always did really well uh and they never seemed to have any problem with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i can see in a lot of cases like it it we didn't in a case where you've got people at home where they don't for for you know almost the you know political reasons or whatever they don't want their kids to go to school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean that testing can be really bogus you know because we knew people in uh the home schoolers associations there that just they were just blatant cheaters and i mean if their kid didn't do well yeah i mean they just filled it out themselves it was absurd you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh you mean you didn't have to take them to like a central location and
 	
 	
 		oh no no they sent them to you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh they sent them to oh boy yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah so you know for us we actually sat our kid down and timed them and everything you know just make it seem like like the real pressure you'd be under
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh you know we heard stories we heard all kinds of stories of people you know it's like well if my kid doesn't do well on it i'll just write in the answers you know uh
 	
 	
 		why why why did you decide i mean did did you decide like to to do that home schooling because you didn't think the your local schools were were good enough  or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes we did that yes that was the reason but we did that out of total ignorance
 		because we never went to the schools to find out what they really were doing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh
 	
 	
 		it was just sort of it was just sort of uh you know hey we remember what public school was like and it was really crappy my wife actually was she's from the Bronx in New York so you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she knew that public schools could be pretty bad
 	
 	
 		yeah did um well what did you think about like you you know you obviously paying taxes for for the for for schools did i mean did
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah
 		oh actually we didn't really begrudge that you know because i mean it's like you know  me i mean it's good it's good that uh
 		to you know my opinion is that they should there should be a public school
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they they shouldn't make everybody go to it i mean you should be able to go to other schools or if you know if people have the credentials to home school well leave them alone but but uh you know as far as the taxes go i mean i don't yeah yeah big deal nah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you didn't worry about it what uh eventually you put your kids back in back in to public school how did that
 	
 	
 		right
