 
		
 			
 				you have any children
 			
 			
 				
 				yes i have three
 			
 			
 				oh okay any college age
 			
 			
 				uh
 				no well um the youngest just finished medical school
 			
 			
 				oh okay so you actually are probably pretty uh
 			
 			
 				
 				and so i feel like i'm kind of home free now
 			
 			
 				uh great i'm on the uh the other end of the spectrum actually i'm uh
 				uh
 				four years into a doctoral program and i am working on my dissertation right now
 			
 			
 				oh well i envy you i wish i had the courage to go back and do that
 			
 			
 				
 				it
 			
 			
 				but i have afraid i have trouble remembering my own name now much less trying to do a dissertation
 			
 			
 				
 				oh
 				yeah well it it it's a rough road as i'm sure your son probably can can attest to as well
 			
 			
 				yes but it's it's very worthwhile when you're finished
 			
 			
 				
 				yeah yeah that's  that's true
 			
 			
 				well what did you look for when you were getting ready to go to a college to a university
 			
 			
 				well
 				to be honest with you i'm not i'm not sure that my
 				my feelings back then are valid or are to be modeled because i was so young um i guess
 				i guess if i had to look at it again i would probably want want to pick a school that
 				uh number one had a good financial aid department uh the school i've been at does not i mean yeah it's okay but
 			
 			
 				um-hum
 				it's not great
 			
 			
 				well they they tend to lose things
 			
 			
 				oh well that's wonderful news
 			
 			
 				yeah uh they lost my transcripts about four times and
 			
 			
 				
 				oh
 				that's painful
 			
 			
 				yeah that's real frustrating um that's that's one aspect of it i think something that's really important is for the school to have a good library
 			
 			
 				yes
 				oh i think that is of the utmost importance
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				uh my son chose to go to A&M here he uh graduated valedictorian of his high school class so he had you know quite a choice but he wanted a good what he considered one of the best science departments
 			
 			
 				um-hum
 				great
 				sure
 				
 			
 			
 				and he wanted to practice in Texas so he chose A&M and uh they were kind of pioneers
 			
 			
 				yeah uh-huh
 			
 			
 				in their science department in that you could choose the whichever professor you felt was the would be the most enlightening for what particular field you were going into
 			
 			
 				true
 				um-hum
 			
 			
 				and they listed them in a pamphlet that you received so uh
 			
 			
 				so you actually got some kind of feel for what the faculty
 			
 			
 				yes so that you could now you didn't have to report to i mean you didn't have just one professor professor that you had to be with if you were in engineering department you might want to go to Professor Smith
 			
 			
 				histories were
 				right
 				um-hum
 			
 			
 				and if you were going to be a doctor an MD you might want to go to Professor Jones and then um
 			
 			
 				right
 			
 			
 				and amongst all those listings they had also classified which what doctors were the better ones
 			
 			
 				um-hum
 			
 			
 				for each particular segment of that field like one might be better in organic chemistry and one might be better in electrical engineering so uh
 			
 			
 				sure
 				right
 				sounds similar to what most schools do in in on a graduate level
 			
 			
 				um-hum
 			
 			
 				um where as it sounds like A&M does it more or does it also on an undergraduate level
 			
 			
 				yes and they uh several of the other universities were using them as a model and going to try it because they felt that
 			
 			
 				so
 			
 			
 				students too often said well the reason i didn't do well on that test is my professor's harder so basically they all gave the same test
 			
 			
 				right
 			
 			
 				and you could uh you were assigned to a particular place and time to take your test but that was the only time
 			
 			
 				
 				um-hum
 			
 			
 				now of course that's what i i marvel at some of these youngsters that i see talk about going off to college that have no self-discipline that
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				you know they're never gonna make it
 			
 			
 				exactly
 			
 			
 				because no matter where you go you there isn't going to be uh mommy to get you up or anything else you know
 			
 			
 				yeah that's that's another thing i wanted to emphasize is that
 				if and if and when i ever get to the point to where i'm looking for schools
 				uh
 				i think i'm gonna opt for a larger one
 			
 			
 				um-hum
 			
 			
 				just because i i think it forces people forces students to be a little more independent i know that i myself went to two schools as an undergrad
 				one was small one was not small
 				and
 				i really think i learned more at the one that was not small because so much of the things i had to do on my own
 				and i learned a little bit more about the system in general
 				and more about myself um being able to handle the situations that i came into
 			
 			
 				i would think that would be true you would also you know be totally on your own where you if you need help you're going to be the one to search it out
 			
 			
 				right um-hum
 			
 			
 				it isn't gonna just be sitting there and life is something that you have to search out everything you're going to do
 			
 			
 				exactly it's it's an active state it's not something that you can kind of you know be passively involved in and expect to do
 				any good really i don't think
 			
 			
 				no i don't think so either now of course uh
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				uh i like i came from the midwest so i'm very partial
 			
 			
 				um-hum
