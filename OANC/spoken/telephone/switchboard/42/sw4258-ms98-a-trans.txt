 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		did you attend public school
 	
 	
 		i did attend public school for all but one year i uh
 		went to a Catholic school for one year found that uh it did not agree with me or i did not agree agree with it and uh spent the rest of my education in public schools
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i had mixed feelings on it uh because i thought that there was a greater range of students that a public school has to uh
 		has to address
 	
 	
 		yes that's true they can't root out the troublemakers as easily
 	
 	
 		right and and the the programs have to be wider uh when i went to the Catholic high school uh there was nothing but a college preparatory course
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and in the public school there were uh a couple of different courses the uh
 		the the so-called business course uh the college prep course and then there was the uh  the uh the the basic uh gas station manager track uh  you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i never
 		yeah
 		yes vocational education we called it
 	
 	
 		right
 		and  i'm not sure
 		that uh
 		the college prep course was any worse in a public school than it would've been in a private school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i think that the teachers were spread a little more thin because they weren't always able to focus on the areas that they taught best
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		and by spreading thin you mean they too many students or too many subjects per teacher or
 	
 	
 		well a little bit of both uh the school wasn't very crowded when i went there although it's since gotten it's since gotten worse but uh there were
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there were some very good math teachers there there was one uh
 		a science teacher in particular there who ended up having to teach a i i can't remember what course it was but it was really unsuitable uh it was some sort of uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		shop or mechanical drawing class and he just
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he know he didn't know much about it but they figured he was a warm body in a room
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's kind of technical so he could
 		him it was him yeah
 	
 	
 		right right
 		and i don't think that uh
 		i don't i don't think that there are the resources in most public schools to be able to say well what we need here is a
 		trained machinist to teach teach the metal shop course let's go find one they just say well you know we have this course we need a body for it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh were already paying this guy
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh
 	
 	
 		did you go to a public school
 	
 	
 		i did i did and uh
 		i felt i got a very
 		i mean i feel i got a very poor education in general uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i think that i knew other people from other public schools who got better educations
 		um uh in our case it think it was
 		you know the teachers uh again spread thin but maybe in terms of just having too many student to really
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do the job um
 		i'm sort of i have a two year old son now and so i'm starting to think about
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		education you know more critically and trying to figure out what we want to do and i'm just sort of turned off by the whole uh
 		the whole system where everyone sits facing the front of the room as quiet as possible while the teacher lectures uh especially for small children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh it just seems like it's not the way they're going to learn best but when you have one teacher and thirty students what else can you do
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know i mean it seems like the the style of teaching that we we have grown to think of as normal i think is dictated by economics
 		in just in terms of uh student teacher ratios um
 	
 	
 		um-hum so have you started looking into uh alternative schools like Montessories
 	
 	
 		um no so far i'm just whining
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i haven't done anything constructive yet uh we fantasize about homeschooling
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		we probably won't
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		although i could see where that would be that could be a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		i can see a lot of advantages to homeschooling but uh
 		there's it's it's interesting there's uh someone here in Rhode Island who is very disgusted with the school system
