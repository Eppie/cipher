 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well um do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		i have a dog who is given me a lot of trouble right now
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and an aquarium of fish yes it's my dog's playtime in the evening and she thinks i'm neglecting her right now
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh right at this moment
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		now what kind of dog do you have
 	
 	
 		i have a Bichon Frise
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		she's a little bit oh good she's playing with the ball she's a little bitty white dog
 	
 	
 		i think i can picture that those are the little long haired
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		fluffy kind of dogs
 	
 	
 		fluffy kind they sort of look like poodles but they're not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they have hair down in their eyes sort of
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah they do and you have to cut it and get it out and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay i picture them with bows in their hair
 	
 	
 		well  he has my dog doesn't like bows
 	
 	
 		for some reason
 		
  
 		well i don't blame him  i have a dog um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she's a a stray and um or was one and she's i think a mixture between a fox terrier and something else she's about eight pounds she's real little
 	
 	
 		oh she's uh yeah she's even smaller than Lacey Lacey is about twelve pounds
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh okay yeah well she's really cute and sweet um  but speaking of pets um my brother just got a little Labrador puppy that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm living with my brother and
 		and uh that's been interesting
 	
 	
 		i'll bet having having having your dog and the puppy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'll bet that's cute
 	
 	
 		it is uh they've there's
 		learning how to play finely and and my dog's establishing her territory because she was there first you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but he's so big even as a puppy that um he gets pretty rough when playing and then she lets him know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's not good no
 	
 	
 		that's not good well my my little dog has a playmate from uh down the street and we have play appointments and play days where
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		um-hum
 		oh huh
 		that's cute
 	
 	
 		where the two dogs trade houses and play and romp just to keep each other company
 	
 	
 		well that's neat
 	
 	
 		yeah this one the her playmate's a little um
 		uh poodle a little miniature poodle they're about the same size and they're both white but the little miniature poodle is is skinny where my dog is fat and fluffy  yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's good yeah
 		more more roly-poly
 		well that's neat that you do that
 	
 	
 		yeah we think it's kind of fun it's better than watching TV to watch the little dogs play
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
  
 		oh definitely and it's better for them too emotionally
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah well i had that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		aquarium first and i got to where i wanted uh
 		take my fish out and hold them and pet them  that wasn't going to work so i had to get something that i could hold and pet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah that's a good idea  i have a bird too
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		yeah but i don't take her out she's kind of ornery
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i like to hear the you know noises she makes i have a parakeet
 	
 	
 		oh a parakeet does she talk to you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		she doesn't uh talk verbally um
 		she doesn't
 		she doesn't know how to use words but i really like the sounds she makes the chirping and all that she sings and all that stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		does she imitate the mocking birds yet
 	
 	
 		no i don't think she's heard a mocking bird
 	
 	
 		oh
 		that's the most fun when they hear the mocking birds and then then begin to try to imitate the mocking birds and the mocking bird is imitating something else
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh well i don't i don't even know if she's heard one i know i put her outside when the days are nice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um but i don't think we've i've heard of a mocking bird around my house
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		or i leave the radio on for her sometimes when i'm i go i go to school all day so sometimes i just leave it on so she can have some kind of stimulation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you know i used to do that for my dog too to give her some stimulation but she didn't seem to appreciate it she kind of likes the quiet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah i i don't know if if and the dogs are real sensitive with their ears
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and yeah that
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		that would make sense that it might be comforting but
 	
 	
 		well i thought it would i thought it would be and i thought i was being a very good dog mother to uh to do that for her but she didn't seem to appreciate it she likes the the quiet
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		oh
 		yeah
 		the quiet
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she also likes being able to hear everything that's going on in the neighborhood and i think the radio masked that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 		that's true that my dog too she has to be near the window and look out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right and look out
 	
 	
 		so she can know what's going on
 	
 	
 		and i had all these delusions about how my dog was not going to go in certain rooms of the house
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's a delusion
 	
 	
 		that's right it's just like you know i surely did  i surely did well what did you name your dog
 	
 	
 		so you learn quick
 		
 
 		yeah
 		Kitty
 	
 	
 		Kitty
 	
 	
 		yes because she acts like a cat
 	
 	
 		oh how so
 	
 	
 		yeah well she's a real lap dog she likes to curl up in your lap
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she'll um
 		she she just you know
 		when she she's real dainty
 		and she likes to jump
 	
 	
 		oh
