 		this is Tad in Seattle
 	
 	
 		hello Tad this is Glenn in Portsmouth New Hampshire
 	
 	
 		ah
 		well i guess i had to wait a long time till they found somebody
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how long were you hanging around for
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know quite a while i was about to go to sleep
 		
 
 		well you ready
 	
 	
 		well i'm glad you hung in there
 	
 	
 		okay you ready okay
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay well um
 		provocative topic as usually
 	
 	
 		oh capital punishment definitely
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		most people have very strong opinions about it
 		usually on both extremes though
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh well
 	
 	
 		what about yourself
 	
 	
 		i'm kind of um
 		waffling i don't know i i uh i don't really like the idea
 		but then occasionally i hear about a heinous crime where i think well if we're going to have public capital punishment then
 		you know this guy should definitely get it one thing that bugs me about it is the uh
 		finality of it i mean occasionally they make a mistake and send the wrong guy to prison
 		sometime later they you know figure it out and they release him
 	
 	
 		um-hum well
 	
 	
 		and uh it bugs me that uh you know this is the one kind of punishment that they definitely can't reverse
 	
 	
 		well i think there's got to be clauses as far as in capital punishment that
 		you can not execute anyone that there's not absolute positive identification
 		and
 		a lot of crimes you
 		uh that a a person is convicted they rely on one person's eye witness testimony
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		something like that i don't think would be substantial enough
 		uh you know somewhere where twenty people saw watched one person mowed gunned down you know five people
 		that's a clear case of a person who should be executed
 		and i unfortunately that that is not the situation right now those kinds the punishment is not set up in most states
 		you know because as you stated earlier there are some crimes that's so barbaric
 		they uh the person that perpetuates the crime deserves to be uh punished
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i uh
 		course usually the case where there's a bunch of witnesses and they see one guy uh mow down a bunch of people and those cases the guy usually turns the gun on himself anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah but unfortunately not in all cases
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that is really the sad part about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh the case in Texas where the person uh shot the restaurant
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess it's Ruby's or someplace like that
 		he ended up killing himself but if he had survived
 		uh
 		by some chance i think it would have been criminal if our system had allowed him to live in prison for life
 	
 	
 		well but um
 		if uh if you don't execute sick people
 		um
 		for acting out their sickness
 		uh how by definition can you execute anybody who pulls off a crime like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean since they're obviously insane
 	
 	
 		well i don't think they're necessarily insane
 	
 	
 		course i guess there's a definition of insanity of whether they or not they knew what they were doing that's a little different than what i'm talking about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i think some people can
 		fool the system into believing that they're truly insane
 		it and i'm i even if they are insane yeah i'm sort i'm sort really sort of a hard core on this well uh Dahmer as an example
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah there are probably seventeen or so victims of his crimes
 		we're going to take care of him in prison
 		uh for an indefinite period of time you know mental hospitals and so forth rehabilitation
 		and that's going to cost us a lot of money
 		and i don't really think that we should be doing something like that
 		you know whether he was uh whether he was ill or not
 		um the crimes were heinous
 		uh
 		yes it's uh it's a good example of where capital punishment would come in handy
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh it it
 		there's a case where the guy's obviously ill
 		i mean a guy that opens up people's brains and performs lobotomies
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		amateur lobotomies i mean is obviously not rational
 	
 	
 		well then
 	
 	
 		i don't know i don't know whether you can you know morally take the power of the state
 		to end that guy's life i i don't know i maybe that's a good reason to end his life
 		if  if he's that irrational
 	
 	
 		well it it i mean what what what would make him rational twenty years of rehabilitation
 		is it really worth spending all that time effort to rehabilitate someone who you may never ever be able to rehabilitate
 		and who it's questionable whether you should be rehabilitated them in rehabilitating them in the first place
 	
 	
 		well yeah i don't know that there's any hope of rehabilitating him but the but then the question comes up does the does the state have the right to do you know essentially the same what he did
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i think the state you know it's one thing to torture someone
 		when you're ending their life
 		which uh was done in the ancient times it's another thing to
 		relatively relatively painlessly inject someone with with uh
 		uh medication to
