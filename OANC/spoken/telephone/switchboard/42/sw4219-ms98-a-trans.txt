 		when i was growing up i had a German shepherd that was everybody
 		my mom brought the dog for herself but the dog didn't like anybody except me
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i was the only child so me and that dog were just like best friends and
 		unfortunately we had to put here out because she got to old but
 		i did want any dogs after that and then when i got married
 		yes i know a chicken
 		that's my young that's my older son
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um i just dogs and horses are the only kind of pets i really enjoy
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 		i got the the Airedale or my husband for a Christmas present
 		and the peekaboo was mine for my girls and me i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and um you know we don't have any now i just got to where um i couldn't afford to feed them you know and um
 		that have to be groom both dogs had to be groomed cause of there hair and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that gets very expensive very expensive to groom
 	
 	
 		oh i know that feeling
 	
 	
 		oh and it just
 	
 	
 		i have to do that with the cocker cause i use to have a cocker to and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it just didn't fit into the budget
 	
 	
 		it would fit into my mines right now either with two kids  it's like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh no that what i have i have two girls and it just
 	
 	
 		oh really i have two boys
 	
 	
 		yeah didn't um didn't fit but we enjoyed them when we had them you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		planning you know
 	
 	
 		we got the Lab when it was a puppy for our boys
 	
 	
 		was fun
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		my my oldest son just insisted he had to have a puppy so we got him a Lab because that's a good children dog
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my friend down the road back home in Arizona breeds cocker spaniels
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she said as soon as i got back home i could have my pick
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i'm waiting to get  my cocker from her
 	
 	
 		that would be good now we got the peekaboo as a puppy but the Airedale was was pretty much grown
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she was a couple years old
 		and um she had been trained and everything before we got her
 	
 	
 		is she papered
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		does she have her papers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but she um she was from a really good family to of of dog you know if that you know whatever you want to call it but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um the only thing was one she was she was use to being on a ranch a big wide open and then i brought her to our our duplex and we had a fence in back yard
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so the only problem with her was when you open the gate she was gone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and this dog if the said sit she'll sit you said lay she she'll lay you tell her go get in your pin she'll go get in her pin
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and she wouldn't come out but if you got her out behind the fence or behind the house inside the house she would not come when you call her
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it would just be she's gone she's gone and she's gone that's it she open up she open the gate by herself
 		you know she would take her nose and flip it open and get out
 	
 	
 		really
 		not very many  learned how to do that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		she was very smart
 	
 	
 		i know my shepherd did and it
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		it just really floored me when it it happen
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because i went out there to feed here one mourning and she was just gone
 	
 	
 		
  
 		she was just gone
 	
 	
 		and i was like Reba Reba where in the heck are you
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i was about to die i thought my goodness we've only had this dog one day two days and she's already gone and i spent all day looking for her
 	
 	
 		i thought somebody stole Reba at first because she was a black and silver shepherd and they are really hard to come by
 	
 	
 		
  
 		they are
 	
 	
 		and she was you know she had her papers and everything
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and i thought somebody stole her at first
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then i she came wondering back later that day with a rabbit in her mouth and just went right back into her pin
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh my goodness
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and i went out there the next mourning to feed her and i put her food in there and i walked out the gate and pretty soon i heard the gate slick open and she comes walking out behind me i was like
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well that isn't going to work
 	
 	
 		
  
 		no they used Molly um this is a dog that um
 		John my husband aunt had brought
 		and that's how i had got her i couldn't have afforded to buy her i mean they are expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um
 		so
