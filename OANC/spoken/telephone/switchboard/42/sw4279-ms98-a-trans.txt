 
     		
 	
 		what kind of car do you have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well at the moment i got two cars one voluntary and the other one involuntary i have a ninety Taurus and a nineteen seventy three Dart which i've been trying to sell for over a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah how do you like your Ford
 	
 	
 		uh it's been fine it hasn't caused very much trouble it was a lot better than that Dart was the first year and it lasted for eighteen um the
 	
 	
 		oh maybe that's a good sign
 	
 	
 		yeah maybe you never can tell i've uh uh you know it it got better as it got older really um it was quite reliable when it was less than ten years old it started to get a little bit less reliable once it passed its tenth birth date but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think they have that tendency i've got a Ford Ranger that i drive and uh
 		i just had it uh oil oil change and lube done to it but before that about two weeks ago somebody busted out my window my passenger window so i had to go get it replaced
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		somebody busted it out so they do that in Minneapolis too i just yesterday
 	
 	
 		well yeah i they uh i had a uniform my band uniform hanging in there and they stole that so that was kind of
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		kind of a bad thing but
 	
 	
 		well it's it's probably easy to catch you know if it's the band is distinctive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's pretty distinctive i don't know what in the world they wanted with it i think it was just kids you know neighborhood kids or something
 	
 	
 		right so right here i have a list of my repairs oh i i do uh actually why didn't i bring this up i
 		i i write a newsletter at Christmas time and i had an article on cars this year and i can just look at that if i can find it before our time expires um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah actually uh
 	
 	
 		but it had an analysis of the cost of my uh eighteen year old car versus my newer car uh let's see there oops trying to yeah real time this is interesting looking up things in real time here um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		all right
 		well actually with regard to Ford
 		the the truck has not been too bad to me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't like Ford
 		at at all the company itself
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i did have a few problems and they've been utterly non responsive
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so whoever i meet i always tell that to them just to make sure everybody knows how i felt
 	
 	
 		i've gone through the dealership and it dealerships used to have a bad reputation for not wanting to do service on cars that they hadn't sold but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the local dealership here which which is not one that sold me the car they've been very good in doing the repairs not that they got the fixed the first time but
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 		that's great is is Raleigh so big or or or or is it so busy that you can that that you can't get in very well or or how does that work there
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		
 
 		no i well i i call them and say which day you know i'd like to bring it in on Thursday that's usually the best day and see if they're if it's okay and it usually is and
 	
 	
 		hm
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		you know i ask them what time and they tell me
 	
 	
 		see i i live in Orlando generally but i'm up here for a year and then i go back down to Orlando
 	
 	
 		i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and down there there are no appointments you go first come first serve which makes it really kind of difficult if you work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh no down there i haven't had much luck except for one Ford dealership in Gainesville Florida that's really very good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's a long way from Orlando
 	
 	
 		Gainesville
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh you mean Minneapolis' a long way
 	
 	
 		no no no no Gainesville i know Orlando Orlando aren't they about an hour and a half drive
 	
 	
 		two two and a half a two and a half
 	
 	
 		two and a half okay so if you live in Orlando and you go to Gainesville for repairs you must be an
 	
 	
 		well my family lives in Gainesville
 	
 	
 		ah okay
 	
 	
 		so occasionally i go up there and and it it happened it so happened that my gear shift lever broke off at the stem when i was in Gainesville so i i had to i had to drive it about fifteen miles an hour all the way to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to the Ford dealership but kind of an interesting thing
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		yeah okay so i find that that my total auto expenses uh dropped from twenty four hundred dollars to eighteen hundred dollars when i when i went from my old car to my new car repairs went down from
 		eleven hundred ten dollars a year eighty eight to ninety nineteen ninety average to a hundred ninety four dollars in nineteen ninety one
 	
 	
 		wow and the first
 	
 	
 		uh that was uh that was from backing into a post it was well hidden in a park in a uh a gas station uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		the first figure you gave me twenty four hundred
 	
 	
 		excuse me yeah twenty four hundred was the expenses uh that was that that that included gasoline repairs maintenance fees and insurance and other expenses
 	
 	
 		i've got one for you if you uh reverse the first two digits of that and make it forty two hundred that's approximately what i spent in two years on a seventy four Volvo i had it was constantly giving me problems
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 		wow and when you when you say you spent it do you mean does that include gasoline or is that just repair
 	
 	
 		no this is strictly uh structural and engine repairs things that had to be done
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like new new transmission things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i was really upset because i was a an undergrad college student at the time and not making a whole lot of money
 	
 	
 		right oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh it was
 		that was one car that i really i liked it a real love hate relationship with it i liked the car because it felt good and it and it drive it drove well when i drove it but then again it had all these problems so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it uh was kind of a bitter sweet relationship i guess
 	
 	
 		i was uh kind of sorry i got rid of my car when i did well now i'm not because it's much
