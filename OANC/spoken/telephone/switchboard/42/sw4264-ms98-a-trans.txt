 
     		
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like i say i'm a i'm a uh a sort of an addict for
 		uh current events and news so i read the paper almost everyday and
 		um
 		i also
 		generally watch one of the national news casts
 	
 	
 		yeah i keep up with most of my stuff either by the news i don't get to read the paper everyday because i just don't have enough time but i read it on Sundays and then i always listen to the like six o'clock or ten o'clock news and then listen to the radio
 	
 	
 		uh my main problem is that um i i like to follow the national news
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i'm i'm really not very happy with local news cast and i'm uh i don't like the local paper paper very much either
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		
 
 		especially since we don't have a choice anymore since Dallas lost its one paper that i
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		um um i usually read the front page and then the editorial page and uh i'm finding that i spend less and less time on the editorial page because the selection is so bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what about USA Today do you read that one
 	
 	
 		no uh i used to
 	
 	
 		nope
 	
 	
 		uh uh the New York Times is my favorite newspaper that's what i grew up with but uh i don't spend the money on it because i know i only get to spend five or ten minutes on it and have to
 	
 	
 		it's not worth it
 	
 	
 		uh let it pile up
 	
 	
 		i like um USA Today
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i mean it's not real thick but it gets most of the stuff in there that's current and going on
 	
 	
 		does it have editorial writers
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		who are some of them
 	
 	
 		now that got got me i mean i don't read it everyday like whenever we're on vacation or whenever i go on vacation or whatever i i get to keep up with it but that's like what once or twice a year
 	
 	
 		can you
 		i wonder if they use their uh the same ones all the time or if they just grab uh the
 		best of the Washington Post and the New York Times and they probably have a few syndicated columnists that they rotate
 	
 	
 		i think well i mean i don't know you know i really have never paid that much attention to that
 	
 	
 		that's that's what the Dallas Morning News does and they they
 		they seem to select
 		select them kind of irregularly and i um
 		i don't think they do a very good job myself
 	
 	
 		yeah do you read the paper everyday
 	
 	
 		pretty much i guess i like i said i read the headlines and then i read the editorial page and then i check the uh local news that's the only thing i really rely on the paper for is the local news
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um i i'm finding that
 		
 
 		McNeal Lehrer
 		uh news hour is the TV program that i
 		i like to watch the most they because they they don't give you these thirty seconds short shots of twenty different stories they usually spend about fifteen minutes or ten minutes on the story
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now um when does that come on
 	
 	
 		ten o'clock well it's actually it's on a couple of times it's on channel two at
 		seven i think and it's on channel thirteen at uh ten o'clock usually
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i try to watch that from ten to eleven unless
 		unless something else is going on
 	
 	
 		the radio station that i listen to in the morning i mean they're they're real good about going over like what's going and i mean they talk about it like some of this like the major events that are going on
 	
 	
 		you ever listen to the public radio station
 	
 	
 		um no no well i mean i may've just flipped through it why
 	
 	
 		KERA
 		they're quite yeah
 		they're quite good uh yeah i like them very much
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		that's that's what i tune to regularly um
 		KRLD if i need to know what the traffic's like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		no the Eagle usually i mean they'll can tell you pretty much they go over the stuff they have a newscaster on there and they go i mean it's short and sweet but i mean they keep you up to date on stuff
 	
 	
 		you spend a lot of time driving
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah well i mean i always listen to the radio or the TV whenever i'm getting ready in the morning
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm always listening to the news um when i drive but i don't drive i mean i my commute is only about five minutes so i
 		i don't have to uh spend a lot of time in the car if i did i guess i would rely more on the radio more than i do on the TV
 	
 	
 		see you have a shorter commute so that's why you get to stay home and read the paper in the morning
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		me i just have to rely on the TV or the um the newspaper i mean the or the
 	
 	
 		right
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		radio station
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i find that
 		most of the TV coverage is too short and superficial so that's one one reason you have to have a newspaper so you can read something in depth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i used to work i worked for a newspaper for six and a half years
 	
 	
 		they did where
 	
 	
 		uh in well in Nacogdoches Texas which is real small town
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh i know where it is yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and oh really well um it was family owned and everything so we didn't like the the way a lot of the stuff was run there
 	
 	
 		was it a weekly
 	
 	
 		daily um-hum
 	
 	
 		daily oh i wouldn't think a size town that size would have a daily newspaper
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but they got bought out by Cox
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so now a lot of things have changed or whatever
 	
 	
 		is it still a daily
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		is that where you grew up
 	
 	
 		yes actually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		well that's
 		
 
 		surprising surprising there was a a daily newspaper at a town that small
 	
 	
 		yeah like i said it was family owned and they pretty much i mean they were in the  i mean well they put in there what they published what they wanted to publish and stuff they didn't want to publish
 	
 	
 		yeah
