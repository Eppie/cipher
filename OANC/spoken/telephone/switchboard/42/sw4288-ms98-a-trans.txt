 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		tell you what this is later
 	
 	
 		all right
 		um well
 		personally with me
 		i think we ought to introduce it to the young people but i don't think you can force it upon them because if you force it upon them
 		they
 		i don't know i it wasn't forced upon me and i i with it beings more my idea it i tend to just stick with it a little bit longer
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd say ten years is a good while especially do is yours on a renewal basis is it
 		do you have to renew each year or
 	
 	
 		no i i just i go through and i i work on like a monthly basis
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i do you know like one weekend a month type thing
 	
 	
 		uh do you have a do you have a minimum requirement for your community service is there a commitment like a term commitment
 	
 	
 		no
 		no um well what i do is i work uh i volunteer with the Red Cross
 		and i'm a member of their disaster team
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and so i pull call once a month to do disaster work such as single family fires
 		and then for national jobs they call me when they need me
 	
 	
 		gosh that must of you must have seen a lot of exciting
 		things and i think that would be good for youth because it would
 		just
 		be an experience that they it would be difficult to get under a lot of circumstances unless you're involved in some kind kind of
 		group
 	
 	
 		right right if you find your niche um you know and and i worked with a lot of of groups that you know have been working to get young people more involved in what we do and um
 		if you can if you can find help them to find their niche you know they'll they'll really grow to love it but if you force them in to something that they're not real keen on they'll rebel on it and at least the ones i've seen
 		you know and and they and they they struggle against it and they want out of it as fast as they can
 	
 	
 		yeah i could see that happening um i i would think with enough publicity there's got to be a wide enough variety of
 		uh groups that they could volunteer with that they if they didn't find their niche in one group if if they're if
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		groups were enough were publicized enough they could just know what they could know what their options were for other groups to try
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and other services to contribute
 	
 	
 		right
 		and something i don't know the Peace Corps
 		signing up and going away  i mean i've got a real good support system with my family and such like that
 		you know and and they're the ones that you know i i i think family can make a really big difference in in sticking something out
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		you know and so you know as long as you don't pull them away from their family to to to take them off somewhere to do something you know you've got a better chance of making it work
 	
 	
 		yeah i think the Peace Corps would be uh scary for a lot of people because of that isolation  even if they were in teams it would be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a little more conducive i think to a to a fellowship feel in that could they could draw a support from
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i understand that a lot of them are uh well i certainly don't know any statistic but
 		that a lot are are working individually and um
 		i guess that'd be it it i would find i find it hard to imagine maintaining an incentive i or maybe not
 		incentive but uh
 		just
 		keeping a focus on the goal
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		well i'd
 		i i had never i didn't know that they were
 		trying to push through a law or anything to make kids do this
 		i that whenever they brought this up that kind of caught me off guard you know i think you know the way i got into mine was they did it it they started it in junior high school and it could just be like an extracurricular club that you could become involved in
 		and you could do as little or as much
 		and you decided how much involvement that you got which you know a lot of people dropped out but we have a lot we have a large number of people that were it was introduced to that way that has stayed with it and had grown with the organization
 		does that make sense
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that does make sense um
 		you'd have to uh i think having having the individual who's volunteering set their own pace
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for development in the program would
 		would be key to just staying staying away from that feeling of being forced into it whether they were officially forced into it or just the pressure was so high to stay in or meet a
 		you know minimum requirement of time commitment that uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know uh but then i think you almost reach a point where
 		if if you pad everything too much it kind of takes away
 		the experience i mean the experience of sacrificing i guess is what i'm thinking
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		does making of going overboard overboard overboard almost
 	
 	
 		right well that's true um
 		and and it one other thing you've got to really look at is uh depending on what age group you're going to involve you know be it high school or whatever you've got to have good adult mentors
 		you know
 		because otherwise you get into this situation of you're too young to do any of this
 	
 	
 		yeah
