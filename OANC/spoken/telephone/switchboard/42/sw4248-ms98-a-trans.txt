 
     		
 	
 		well this is something i just got back from working out yes um i'd spend about five or ten minutes stretching and then i i used to be just a walker i i was really into walking about three miles everyday and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh did you
 	
 	
 		i'd go to the weight room and and and get in every part of my arms and work on legs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but now i'm training to run and i i fun run here in Tyler and it's just two miles but um i'm up to running a mile so i walk real fast for two miles which takes me about thirty minutes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then i'll run a mile and then i'll cool down and feel like i'm going to die  but it's a lot of fun for me it's it's a task when i don't feel like it
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true are you a member of a club or anything is that where you go lift weights are you a member of a club or
 	
 	
 		but most of the time it's fun
 		huh
 		no um in college and the junior college i'm going to right now has a really good fitness center
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so they have a cardiovascular room where they have a Stairmaster
 	
 	
 		oh that's great uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and sometimes i do that i kind of got burned out on the Stairmaster and uh they have a real good weight room and i do a lot of free weights free weights more than machines i enjoy those more
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 		huh i've been uh i'm more i've never seriously
 		seriously lifted weights i wrestled in high school and i couldn't and they always made us and i hated it and stuff hadn't done it since but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh now i'm just more of a recreational sport player i don't really do much exercising other than i play softball five or six nights a week and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh some basketball but i've God i've never have since high school i don't think i've been on a serious
 		or uh exercise program course it shows getting a little bit heavier  but uh i have a hard time going out and running though that's that's pretty difficult for me to do i don't know why but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah yeah it's it's pretty difficult for me too but i've got one month to train for the two mile run i'm fixing to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's not very fun fun fun you know that's not very far to run and a month isn't very long and they call it a fun run i don't see how they can put fun and and run together
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well are you are you doing it yeah yeah it's true are you running for serious or you just running to kind of get through for the fun of it or do they
 	
 	
 		and i'm running to get in shape yeah i'm in i'm in really good shape now but uh i've only been seriously in a workout program since September
 	
 	
 		are you
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i'm knocking close on a year just to be you know mean you know almost but um i'm just i really i had a partner last semester in school that was into body building and he'd been in it for about three years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so he really got me into lifting weights and i and i did that a lot for the first time i i got i went into a weight room in September  and it was real intimidating i was one of the only girls and uh that didn't help any
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i'll bet
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		but uh i got started into that and i ended up gaining uh almost ten pounds from muscle
 	
 	
 		oh really just in muscle though
 	
 	
 		just in muscle well i i had a bigger appetite too so no i actually i lost size
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i gained in weight you know because of muscle but now i'm trying to to get rid of some of the bulkiness
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and my arms got quite a bit bigger and i i didn't really want them to get that much bigger so now i'm  i'm doing they say to define your muscles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you do a lot less weight and a lot of repetition so that's what i'm working on now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so how often you go and lift then do you do it daily or
 	
 	
 		well um i go Monday through Friday i walk and run but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yesterday i wasn't feeling good so i missed Monday and i'm out of town on Friday  so i'm going to have to go on Saturday so i'll at least get four days in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well that's great yeah i i'm trying to like i said i play softball of course not in the winter up here but uh i usually do something for about two months just to get me in shape for that i do a lot of sit-ups and push-ups but
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i still like i say the running and i've we've been meaning to buy some mountain bikes i hard part for about me for running is just i don't
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		you see the same thing you never go far enough to see anything really different and i like the change of scenery and stuff so that's why i was thinking of my wife and i about getting a bike for each of us and then you know we you can go
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		yeah
 		do you live in the mountains
 	
 	
 		uh we live right close by them we i live right at the base of the Wasatch mountains here and so i close enough that we there's trails and everything all of the way around and that we can go up and use and we go camping quite a bit and we take them with us you know we take them with us there so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's a lot of area we can go in up around there i have just one little daughter
 	
 	
 		do you have any kids
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		you know and actually that's my exercise now just trying to keep up with an eighteen month old that's more than enough so
 	
 	
 		eighteen months
 	
 	
 		yeah she's well she learned to walk about six months ago and she hasn't stopped she  she just ongoing so we chase her around the house all the time so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's uh
 	
 	
 		you get a little of exercise in on that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah we do believe me there's nothing like having a kid to chase that'll  do it for you
 	
 	
 		well i'm going to wait a long time till that happens i'm i'm i'll be twenty May sixth and i'm just going to get through college and hopefully move to some different states
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		good idea
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and stay single for a while  but in the mean time i'm i'm trying to stay in shape and i i love to play racquetball
 	
 	
 		not a bad idea
 		yeah
