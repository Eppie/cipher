 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay okay okay i'm uh
 		well i do work for a large company uh large meaning about twelve twelve thousand people
 	
 	
 		that's big
 	
 	
 		and uh it use to be twice as big
 		could've been uh could've been better i'll put it this way when i came to work here it was twenty five thousand and now it's twelve thousand and dropping
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh the advantages of a  how how big is the company you work for
 	
 	
 		uh less then a hundred people
 	
 	
 		okay less then a hundred
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		some of the same thing still applies i've work for company's uh your size before
 		and some of the same thing still applies though uh one of the things is
 		like i know a guy that gone to work for his self
 		and
 		and uh after a while he became
 		isolated
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah he was he craved uh  yeah
 	
 	
 		interaction yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and uh that's one of the nice thing a about a company uh interaction with other people access to internet uh
 		do you have internet how did you get hook up to this
 	
 	
 		uh well i have an internet uh through another i have another internet connection through another network but we're in the process of
 		establishing our own internet feed internet feed
 		um
 	
 	
 		so thing like that the internet uh access internet access to a library
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		gee how do i say it uh
 	
 	
 		well i think the diversity of a large company is a strong thing for it um the the fact that there are so many different ways that uh working for a company could take you a a large company um
 		granted if your skill your skill were like nuclear physics so you pretty much narrow to to uh
 		
 
 		your choices are narrowed but
 		i can see someone with on doing what i do going into many different sort of venue i guess you'd call them in a larger company
 		um
 		i'm a system engineer and i basically
 		design networks um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so for our end user and our customer i'm you know uh
 		i'm pretty much limited to that that's what that's what i do
 	
 	
 		the
 		one of the advantage of uh of a uh larger company and the hundred is uh could be consider a larger company is
 		is access to other people that do the same thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you're the only computer programmer in your company then it's it's it is kind of isolated
 		and uh
 		so that one of the advantages of there's a lot of disadvantage of course but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i think one of the disadvantages is the bureaucracy that props up as a you know necessity for almost anything getting anything done at all you have to
 		uh
 		many layers to go through
 	
 	
 		yes and one other thing that that uh tends to happen
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		in in a larger company is uh
 		oh how do i say it uh lack of access to uh
 		to people they they tend to departmentalize and and uh move away where as in a company your size
 		uh let see a hundred or so it i in the pass had access to people who had access to just anything anything anything and everything was uh was available
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where as in a company like this it's very fragmented
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i'm i might be
 	
 	
 		um-hum and you have the typical pyramid structure of organization many work group one man on top or woman um and middle management and the whole nine yards right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah and so well i can be ten feet away from somebody that is doing the same thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		we are structure in the uh
 		in uh in uh bubble
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh structure
 		we are many different work group however we work together
 		um that's by design we've had the same structure for basically for twenty years
 		and uh it allows us to do many interesting thing we have many facet to our organization
 		uh and we are able to mix and match and bring different facet into play as they're need so we we basically cover the whole spectrum of computing uh for our for our customers and uh
 	
 	
 		i i have one fear here i i don't know if i push the one button long enough
 	
 	
 		i think you did
 	
 	
 		do you think you can hear that huh okay because i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		i haven't they haven't said that we're out of space yet maybe they deleted their temp directory
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well in the past they've it they seem to shut us off fairly quickly so i i was wondering about that let me try it once more here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well um you know we can talk as long as we like or until they tell us i've usually hit the marker to
 		um we are not suppose to be talking about this anyway uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so we're  we're in a we're in a bubble diagram and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		that's that's a really effective and i think that is a very nineties kind of thing like i say we've had it for twenty something years and so we are really good at it but uh
