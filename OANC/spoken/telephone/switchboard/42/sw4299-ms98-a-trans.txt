 
     		
 	
 		music yeah
 	
 	
 		music huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		always an interesting topic
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i uh i have a little bit of an interesting experience with music i've been a part-time disc jockey uh
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		work for a a company a little company in Virginia that does uh DJ stuff for weddings and uh birthdays and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we've uh  we've had to play quite a bit of of music uh over the past several months so it's interesting to see what people like and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you involved at all in music or uh
 	
 	
 		um uh uh a strong appreciator of it um yeah i i did the typical piano thing back uh when i was young and i even played trombone in band for a number of years
 	
 	
 		um-hum hum
 		ah
 		hum
 	
 	
 		um but i don't actively uh play anymore i just listen and spend too much money on discs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum right
 		yeah it's interesting now there all going to uh CD's now also
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i uh have a little bit of an involvement in uh
 		in square dancing and and round dancing and that's all all all still on forty fives
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh so they're  they're having an interesting problem when it comes to the music for that because the uh
 		the forty fives are generally played on a variable speed turntable so you can speed it up or slow it down for the dancers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so now they're wondering how they're going to do that with CD's  it's going to be a little tougher if if it ever goes to CD's it's not it hasn't converted over yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think the only group of folks who even use forty fives for music anymore
 	
 	
 		um yeah yeah that's interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that even the aerobics people are using uh all their music is on cassettes or CD's
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well that you know technically it shouldn't be difficult to uh modulate the the speed on a compact disc yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		yeah i should be able to and cassettes i know that they do have some that are variable speed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i think those are machines for for aerobic instructors
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so uh and uh
 		i found that uh at least at the things i've DJed people like things they can dance to  if you can get them to dance
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's kind of the hard part uh at these parties they tend to want to sit around or stand around and talk or uh drink and talk or whatever and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then getting them to dance and then they they have different taste in dance music some of them like the fast stuff and some the slow
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we're kind of uh into oldies right now in our in our family for some reason we're most of what we listen to is oldies
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so  and yourself you you just mostly listen then yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah um i guess i'm towards the uh other end of the spectrum um i listen to a lot of uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		hum hum
 	
 	
 		techno dance um you know electronic compilations things like that uh really alternative and and progressive music
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 		hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um so
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's kind of the other end of the spectrum for you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i got uh some albums i've picked up that i've kind of recently gotten interested in it's uh
 		the uh African music
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh there's a a group that Paul Simon has uh featured uh well on his album Graceland
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		it's called Lady Smith Black Membazo
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they're a uh African uh group that sings a cappella
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		yeah they're a very good group
 	
 	
 		um-hum much of their music is sung in Zulu in the Zulu language so that's uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's a an interesting and uh i guess it kind of falls into the
 		i guess the reggae category uh whatever that is  i'm not quite sure what reggae is actually
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that that
 		
 
 		um that's that's more like Bob Marley and the Whalers um a lot of the other Jamaican uh groups it's so it's a strongly Jamaican based music
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		ah ha uh-huh
 		hum
 	
 	
 		um but it it it's interesting too i'm not terribly familiar with with
 		reggae itself i know it's influenced a lot of of stuff especially some of the more modern dance stuff they take a lot of the more complicated rhythm structures
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh from reggae and try to translate that into uh more current hits
 	
 	
 		you ever hear of a musical from called Zydeco
 		i had never heard of it before
 	
 	
 		um i've heard of it but i couldn't give you a definition of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		we had uh what were we doing we were DJing a uh
 		i think it was a company party and they had gotten a request for some of that
 		so i did a little research on it it's uh Louisiana
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the uh French uh Cajun music
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's that's called Zydeco i'd never heard of that term before
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh and i i was able to listen to a few
 		tapes from the library of of what it was like and it was definitely different  Cajun type music i'd never actually even heard it before
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum yeah
