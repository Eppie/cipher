 
     		
 	
 		what kind of air pollution do you think is the worst
 	
 	
 		
 
 		in Philadelphia i think the worst is cars
 	
 	
 		cars
 	
 	
 		because there isn't a lot of manufacturing right in Philadelphia any more at least not any heavy manufacturing
 	
 	
 		yeah but they couldn't there is a lot of different pollution you can get from cars right
 	
 	
 		right a lot of pollution from cars and also the trucks that drive around through so i think transportation is the worst right here in the city
 	
 	
 		um-hum there is carbon monoxide carbon dioxide
 	
 	
 		oh right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		nitric oxide
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the all that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		and plus we get the chlorofluorocarbons i guess from the old refrigerator and old cars
 	
 	
 		yeah and there's ozone
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's like uh from
 		also like when you fill-up your car with gas
 	
 	
 		well you know in Philadelphia they've got these gas vapor recovery nozzle on all the gas tank now
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		if you go to the gas pump you it just sucks it back out
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		it makes it really hard to tell when your tank is full though
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		because you can't really lessen very well
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you have to just trust the automatic shut off
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so you can't really get it full if you are going on a long its really hard
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well let's see what else there's uh
 		more more sometimes they say it more pollution inside your house
 	
 	
 		yeah from all the gas stoves and everything yeah
 	
 	
 		well i got the dry cleaning
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that stuff is pretty nasty nasty
 		um i know all the kind of fumes you can get from bathroom cleaners your aerosols
 	
 	
 		that's true though most help aid don't let me use
 		bathroom cleaner with bad uh chemicals in them any more
 	
 	
 		chlorofluorocarbons chlorofluorocarbons chlorofluorocarbons or something like that chlorofluorocarbons that's it
 	
 	
 		right they make me use Simple Green or um they will let me use Comet or self cleanser but
 	
 	
 		what simple simple green is supposedly  it not toxic really
 	
 	
 		right it it suppose to be none toxics and its suppose to be good for the environment
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so they like that
 		i prefer uh
 		ammonia
 		and um
 		there's something my mamma gave me
 		last time i was visiting her its a
 		it's called scrub free it really makes a bad odor though so my housemate don't like that
 	
 	
 		what is it
 	
 	
 		scrub free
 	
 	
 		scrub free huh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		you know i knew that the air in Philadelphia was not the greatest when i first came here it i lived where i could on a clear day
 		see the Walt Whitman bridge but i couldn't see it for a a couple of months until it got to be winter time and the pollution cleared up
 	
 	
 		oh really where are you originally from
 	
 	
 		from South Carolina
 	
 	
 		oh huh
 	
 	
 		but the amazing thing i was out at San Francisco a few years ago and the air there is so clean
 	
 	
 		well not always depends if you don't there if there's a brief stop then you get the uh smog
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		doesn't move like you're out in Lake Tahoe its like that you can really smell the gas fumes from cars the air is trap and it doesn't go anywhere
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in fact the worst place is probably in Mexico Mexico City i heard is
 	
 	
 		right on the top of the mountain yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they validated i think uh
 		one or two hundred day uh days out of a year over three or four times the
 		known you know the allowable limit
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it crazy and uh some of the worst kind that our you can have also air pollution you can just have cigarette smoke
 		stuck in
 	
 	
 		oh cigarette smoke the worst place for air pollution of cigarette smoke is the laundry mat i hate that
 	
 	
 		in a laundry mate
 	
 	
 		right when people come in and they're smoking while they're waiting for their clothes and you take yours out
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they're all clean and you want to hang them up and
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		there all these people smoking there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		really wow
 	
 	
 		fortunately i've started going at an hour where not many people smoke
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i really hated that when that was a problem for me
 	
 	
 		i know which is worst cigar smoke or regular cigarette smoke
 	
 	
 		uh boy
 		um
 		boy i'll chose regular cigarette smoke
 	
 	
 		yeah hum
 	
 	
 		but if there was as many people smoking cigars as there were cigarettes cigar smoke would definitely be worst
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i don't know its a lot of smoke out uh out her you can see um
 		the New Jersey when you go by the refinery or even when you go across the Delaware River
 		down by uh
 		it passes away but down as you go down toward ninety five you see all that
 		that stuff that comes out of the refineries
 	
 	
 		oh right
