 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay i guess probably the first thing uh we could start off with is
 		uh if you've ever been on a jury before or not
 	
 	
 		oh that's a very interesting question the answer that i have is no in fact um i was selected for jury at one time but uh fortunately for me or unfortunately just depending on your perspective
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i had already changed jurisdiction jurisdictions uh and so i had to reply that i couldn't do it
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right
 		i uh just recently retired from the army and and so when we uh moved to this area here i got selected for jury duty as did my wife and uh it was an interesting experience i'd never done it before and
 	
 	
 		well was it civil or or criminal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		this was uh all civil
 		although i uh i did have a chance at a criminal one they uh actually had to interview like about a hundred and fifty people
 		before they could actually
 		uh get together a jury because there had been so much publicity about it but uh i was not selected for that one i would have been interesting i think
 		but the i guess the question that is uh what we think of uh trial by jury
 		that's a hard question
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah well on on the one hand there's a lot of uh of of of positive things you're not at the whim of one person who might have a grudge or a prejudice
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		on the other hand um
 		well
 		juries are not legally expertise experts and and they often just feel bad for somebody
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but which is right they should often uh especially for example in a a civil case
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they'll feel bad for the person who got injured and not take into account uh any of the legal aspects of the incident and award large damages that were really undeserving from a legal point of view
 	
 	
 		right and it meant um-hum
 		right
 		course you're uh as a juror to you're
 		you're really at the mercy of the uh the lawyers
 		because you don't know what really went on
 		and you can never depend on anybody telling the truth
 		and uh you're kind of at the mercy of the various lawyers who are uh
 		examining and cross examining the witnesses and they're
 		so it's it's really tough and one of the things when i was on the jury that that bothered me was the fact that i was holding in my hands possibly the life of that individual
 		and when you got right down to it
 		uh you i really never knew who was really telling the truth and who wasn't
 		you can't you can't go by what the the lawyer is uh is saying pretty much and you don't know if the witnesses are being truthful even though they are sworn to tell the truth
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's a very difficult decision i found uh  one of the things that bothered me was the in one case the
 		the trial was stupid these people were supposedly adults you'd think they could have worked their problems out
 		but instead
 		we had to sit there and listen to all the dumb things that they did and i felt sometimes like saying why don't you people just
 		you're supposed to be adults why don't you get with the program and work out your problems instead of having to to go through all this in front of a jury it just seemed it just seemed dumb at the time
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's hard you get when you get involved emotionally in somethings
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		so it it uh it gets
 	
 	
 		it's an awful responsibility but it's like voting and all the other things that we're responsible for it's
 	
 	
 		uh all the civic duty yeah
 	
 	
 		one of those things you have to do i guess
 	
 	
 		well i think one of the problems that we have here in the United States and the the question didn't seem to focus on civil things they want more focus on criminals
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um from my my perspective one of the problems is that in our Bill of Rights
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we have it written that uh even for civil cases everyone's guaranteed a right to a jury as long as the uh dispute is for more than twenty five dollars
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now twenty five dollars at the time that they wrote the Bill of Rights was a lot different than what it is now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that was a lot of money
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		basically what it means is uh they try to say you know like uh petty things you don't get a jury and nowadays that same twenty five dollars might be i don't know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		ten thousand dollars i i'm not exactly sure the uh the economics involved and
 	
 	
 		well yeah what the value would be equal to today
 	
 	
 		that's right and uh it makes it very uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh most cases in small most small cases for uh civil suits really shouldn't have even have the option of a jury
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i know we i was involved uh in a suit uh where the uh
 		you know long time ago there was an accident whatever and an ambulance chaser came by and and wanted know you know i don't know five or ten thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and they requested a trial by jury
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it seemed like really stupid that that they should even have that option for for such a small amount that our founding fathers didn't understand the economic principles involved
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 		the uh
 		right
 		first one that i had was a drug case
 		and then the second one was a
