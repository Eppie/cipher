 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hi what kind of pets do you have
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well let's see i've got a a a Great Dane actually use to raise Great Dane when i was in college uh in graduate school
 	
 	
 		that interesting
 	
 	
 		and uh sold them sold them for a pretty handsome profit about four hundred dollars a piece
 		and uh help me pay my uh pay for my kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i've got to uh Scottish Fold cat
 		cats which are uh pretty unusual cats
 	
 	
 		are they short hair or
 	
 	
 		there median hair uh their like their hair length is like a tubby but uh and actually they're closer related to the American tubby
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but they have uh they call them folds because they have this genetic anomaly that make their ears fold over and so they look like they're they're snarling all the time
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh which is it's a pretty it's a pretty cute look you know on a cat uh that after after they you know when their little especially but uh you know now ours now ours is getting a little bigger bigger almost a year old
 	
 	
 		so their their full grown cats at this point their almost
 	
 	
 		yeah just the yeah just to basis and uh their extremely docile i mean their the most
 		their their so calm actually one of them um it so calm we actually thought it had some brain damage or something you know because it just
 		pretty much sleep like a dog all the time you know we did know we what was going on thought it should be you know running around you know scratching up furniture something but uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		does it seems to be okay though
 	
 	
 		yeah the guy said it was fine and uh
 		you know
 	
 	
 		does the
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it was just it was good i mean the actually since i've got a i've got three little kids so they uh you know spend all there time playing with these things so i'm kind of glad that it's not a very active cat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's more of a uh you know it can take a lot of punishment and doesn't seem to get to excited about it so
 	
 	
 		you also have less breakage
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		fewer thing get broken around the house
 	
 	
 		yeah now do do you have animals to
 	
 	
 		yeah um their's a couple of cats one of them is name Jimmy
 		and he's he's uh mostly black but he has some orange and white
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh he's about three three and a half year old now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he's sitting here looking at me
 		and um the other one is Tiffany Tiffany is actually a male
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but
 		at the time that we got Tiffany we name him before we realize what his sex was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because he you really can't see to well what his you know
 	
 	
 		pretty  yep
 	
 	
 		i mean it wasn't like very obvious and so we name him Tiffany because he seems like a pretty prissy little cat and we thought it was a she
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh anyway so Tiffany's name stuck even though his sex change
 	
 	
 		look at look at Johnny Cash song  yeah that's
 	
 	
 		yes
 		and uh then there's a dog name Taylor he's uh uh Doberman
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he's about ten months old now Tiffany and Taylor and Taylor are about are about the same age
 	
 	
 		yeah we had a we had a red uh doberman uh a long time ago
 		and we call we we named it uh Mistral as in as in the music you know like the Wondering Mistral
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but uh and not real realize because we were you know  we just didn't realized what it was going to sound like you know when we went out the back door
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and scream you know Mistral Mistral  wish i could have saw our neighbor like what the hell going on over there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and we didn't realized for the longest time why everybody thought it was so funny until we finally picked up on it but
 		anyway the
 		it really was a good dog i was amazed at the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the energy that doberman have i never realized it compared to Great Dane i mean Danes are like just really slow moving animals and uh
 	
 	
 		Taylor is pretty quick he's real springing uh he just kind of like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		just bong up in the air
 	
 	
 		pounds along or something i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he he he really um it's interesting to which him walk he's he loves everything i mean he he really would love to get closer to the cats but the cats think he's way to big
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you you know like oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what's this big thing doing putting it's paws right next to my my head here
 	
 	
 		it we had it when when we first got the uh the cat our Great Dane was standing in the living room
 		and the cats you know literally were out the out the bag you know they just came out and their wondering around and one of them wonders in to the leg of the dog
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it the the dog doesn't move you know and you can see the cat the cat kind of looks at it really think you know this must be a chair leg or something you know
 		and it kind of  if it looks up higher and higher until it looks up and then there this gigantic face you know right in front of the cats face
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it really it really freaked out the cat face it's like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		boom oh my gosh what was that
 	
 	
 		exactly but that was that that was one of the funnier uh things that happen
 	
 	
 		hey Sammy come over here and look at this thing
 	
 	
 		yeah  but uh their
