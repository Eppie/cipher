 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i find that my main source of information on current events is conversations with other people i often find myself going oh is that right i didn't realize that it happened yesterday
 	
 	
 		oh really so you do you uh don't
 		pay attention to uh primary sources
 	
 	
 		no not not on a regular basis
 	
 	
 		like TV or
 		oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh have frequently decided just that i would just go ahead and read a paper every day but i haven't really
 		done it as often as i i intended
 	
 	
 		what about television
 	
 	
 		um i just don't watch much television i'm usually i usually don't get home until after the evening news is over and i'm usually in bed by the time the late news starts
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i um i do watch some TV and and sometimes there'll be if it's some big news with like with the primaries and things like that they would run little banners across the bottom of the TV screen
 	
 	
 		what about the gulf war
 	
 	
 		um i i worked with a guy who was in the
 		who had just gotten out of the army and he told me he kept me up to date on what was going on
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		how do you keep up on current events
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh well i'm pretty much of a space cadet a zombie i really don't know much what's going on uh i guess most mostly of what i get is from the news from the excuse me from the newspaper
 		i don't have a television so that doesn't help
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you feel like you keep up sufficiently i mean are you as caught up with it as you'd like to be
 	
 	
 		um
 		i get a daily newspaper and um i think newspapers are better then television for in depth news they uh
 		the television uh actually is good in uh uh particularly when we're you're talking about personalities because you can get a heck of a lot more through uh complete audio visual presentation like for example in the political debates and what not
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		than you do through distilled string of words uh in the newspaper but
 		actually for indepth information the newspaper newspaper is definitely better uh because the television just presents highlights and doesn't really go much indepth
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		can't really because they don't have the time
 	
 	
 		right right i guess i'd have to agree with you i hadn't really though of that but i certainly
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		seems seems
 	
 	
 		and when i'm on
 		airplanes i will use i will read news news magazines
 		uh that my son likes news magazines but uh
 		i
 		i guess i just never get around to reading them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's sort of a tradition to read the newspaper over breakfast but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		is that what you do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		read your newspaper over breakfast and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sort of of
 		
 
 		sort of a relaxing time
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 		um do you listen to the radio much
 	
 	
 		nope
 		nope
 		i think radio is in our house more of a source for music
 		in quotes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't listen to the radio but my son does
 		of course he's thirteen and
 		his idea of music is not quite the same as my idea of music
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		yeah i get i get a little bit of news from the radio just they'll have hourly updates on
 		some news caps
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well when i'm driving in the car that's right sometimes uh well driving in the bay area is risky in the since that you may run into uh traffic problems
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i will tune in to news uh station
 		where they give every ten minutes they give traffic information
 		and uh
 		as a sort of a side effect i get news that way
 	
 	
 		right
 		um i would think even the traffic i think of the traffic updates as news also just because
 		there i guess they qualify as a current event
 	
 	
 		well i guess you're right  nothing more current than uh uh nothing more current and nothing more news worthy than uh traffic problems if at least not if you're a driver
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so uh i didn't even think about that
 	
 	
 		i guess um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i would think that would be probably on a i guess as a percentage of the population that would keep up with something i bet the traffic conditions is probably number one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well it's a beautiful day here in uh California i'm standing outside of a phone booth you know when you call in you're supposed i guess you're supposed to call from different numbers so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i call from a bunch of uh pay phone pay phones and whatnot
 		so the news the news the current event news in California is that we had rain yesterday
 		and uh it's sort of a cloudy i would say broken skies mostly almost not quite overcast but almost overcast
 		and uh
 		that's your current current event
 		news cast from um
