 
     		
 	
 		yeah Jim uh so uh how many children do you have and what are their ages
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh we have two they're going to be two and four years old in April
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's after uh twenty one years of marriage  so so we we've had quite an experience over the last four years of readjusting our time in terms of spending with the kids how about yourself Frank
 	
 	
 		oh is that right wow
 		i imagine
 		we have uh four children but they're all grown and out of the house now
 		but we still uh spend a a lot of time together really it's a it's a close family uh
 		we have one daughter that's going to college uh in Boston and uh we don't see uh you know an awful lot of her every couple of weeks uh we manage to get together maybe three weeks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i've got uh one son that lives uh about ten miles north of us and a couple other sons that live uh about an hour away a piece they they live in the same basically in the same area about an hour away from us
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i would say that every uh couple of weeks uh we're together with one of the you know one of the kids sometimes we have uh family get togethers probably every oh
 		couple of months
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of a different situation are you do you have a boy and a girl two boys two girls
 	
 	
 		two girls yeah yeah and  my wife and i are both from Saint Louis and we've been in New Jersey now for uh eleven years
 	
 	
 		two girls uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we've been away for a long time and when it was just the two of us we'd go back about every year but now that we have the two girls we try to get back twice a year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because we both grew up with uh family all around us and weekend with the cousins and
 		uh both of our families have uh we have siblings that have lots of children so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we miss that environment but and i think partly because of that because our family's a thousand miles away
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we might even overcompensate
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we uh pretty much uh between between that thousand mile distance from uh relatives and the fact that we had uh uh eighteen years together
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		married life uh before our daughters were born and uh we we pretty much it it seems like our whole life is devoted to the girls
 		i mean from  waking until
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh till night time we we literally have an hour and a half to ourselves every night
 	
 	
 		i i know what you
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no uh does your wife work or not
 	
 	
 		no she stays at home uh and
 	
 	
 		okay that's good uh
 		my son uh one of my sons i should say that uh had been married for nine years just had a a uh daughter uh back in July last July
 		and you know they were getting pretty set in their ways after nine years and uh it was quite a readjustment for them so i imagine after uh eighteen years it really was a a a an adjustment in your lives
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		it wasn't it wasn't um uh partly because we had all that time together we're ready to focus on a family so and of uh course the changing economy you know helps focus on the the home life also
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i mean our lifestyle changed drastically we went from two incomes and no children so we had Caribbean vacations and new cars and expensive cars down to
 	
 	
 		um
 		right
 	
 	
 		one income two children and uh the total uncertainty of the job market now so we we pretty much stay at home
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		focus we we do have our older daughter in a preschool a Montessori and that's quite expensive and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in fact my wife just joined the uh was just elected last night to the board of the school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so she's spending quite a bit of time in fact she's on the other line right now doing school board talk
 	
 	
 		oh is that right huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it it seems like even our leisure time it's been focused more centered around the kids
 	
 	
 		what do what do you find is the trend amongst families in your observation for how they spend their time together what activities they're doing and how they spend the time do you think they have more or less or what
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it seems to me uh that families are spending more fractional time together
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that maybe one parent will go off with one child and another parent will go off with the other children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um rather than and focusing more on the children's activities rather than family activities and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i think with so with so many parents working both husband and wife that it's difficult to find time for everybody to be together
 	
 	
 		yes and partly because of that working phenomena then the kids end up getting their lives scheduled with
 		ballet and football and soccer i mean we we live in an area that uh soccer and football is just taking off phenomenally
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we we have terrible problems with scheduling soccer fields and finding enough land to even to build new football fields that they need
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and part of that phenomena is the dual working household and i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		rather than spending the time in the evening with family activities
