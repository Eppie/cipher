 		uh but i'm very you know i you know i've gotten

 		but still manage to sort of sing about the same things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so do you play at all yourself
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh actually actually i play uh i play the flute i  i was in uh band all through high school and i still pick it up uh i don't play with any organized group now but uh i play still play every now and then

 		my favorite ones to play are uh stuff like Mozart i love Mozart and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		um just general classical stuff Bach and Brahms
 	
 	
 		uh-huh how long have you been out of high school
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i've been out of high school for two years now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um yeah i used i used to play uh in the percussion section in the high school band and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh really
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah i enjoyed that but it's not something that you can do so easily by yourself
 		you know sit around with a snare drum and you get kind of bored  um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and i played piano in the jazz ensemble
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 	
 	
 		and that i still keep up with a little bit but
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i'm still i'm doing what kind of sounds similar to what you'r e doing i i have pieces i could play in high school and i still play them
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i i i really like to move on to something else but uh i haven't been putting the time into it so sort of marking time at the same place
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		
  
 		oh
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh now when i was in high school though
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		we we knew about one funk band that we were excited about that's probably
 	
 	
 		who was that
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know ancient history by this time uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		oh God course the name just uh the name just slipped my mind but it's the Peace of Parliament
 		
  
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		is that like
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		that's not doesn't even exist anymore does it
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		Parliament and they had a thing the peace funk was their big thing
 	
 	
 		
  
 		huh i don't know i've never heard of them
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay who do you listen to
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh um
 	
 	
 		
  
 		in funk
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i don't know if you would i don't know if most most anybody would call it funk but uh  bands like Primus and Fishbone and things like that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		okay
 		
  
 		you know i've heard of them but i've never heard their music
 	
 	
 		
  
 		really i really like um Primus a lot Primus is a good group
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh are the radio stations near you that play this sort of thing
 	
 	
 		
  
 		no not really um
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i i i think i think that Primus gets a little air time on like MTV and stuff but i don't think i i don't think i've ever heard one of their songs on the radio Fishbone either
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so you have to get the albums uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right right yeah
