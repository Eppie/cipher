 
     		
 	
 		so what do you sell them or what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh don't don't bit your tongue no no actually i'm a system engineer and uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i'm sitting right know before there my Mac is at my right hand and my
 		DOS machine is at my left hand and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		alright i've got a Mac in front of me as well
 	
 	
 		good for you
 	
 	
 		yeah well i
 		it's weird um where i came from they were all IBM oriented because i'm a doctoral student at UCF University of Central Florida
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		i IBM got to the campus first a long time ago and established themselves so i was real IBM format when i came up here to Minnesota
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but now up here everybody at Honeywell is Macintosh oriented or Sun or Silicon Graphics or what ever
 	
 	
 		give me a graphical interface any day huh
 	
 	
 		well i don't know yes yes and no in a way
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i find almost that i am slower on graphical interface than i am on textural
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems to be the great equalizer that's one thing that i've notice is uh you you put uh open windows on a sun and i don't see amazing power from it it doesn't degrade as much under a load as a typical
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like an intel chip would but uh it it like i said i i i consider GUIs as a great equalizer you know they help people work but they seem to bring all of the machine to there knees
 	
 	
 		right
 		so because
 		yeah that true actually i'm i'm kind of interfacing interested in uh i'm a human factors person
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh really that's interesting work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's what my doctorate degree going to be in so i'm kind of interested interested in the interface of the whole anyway you know but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that would be um
 	
 	
 		who who do you work for
 	
 	
 		this is a great time for you to be into it you know
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah i hope so actually interfacing is not really my forte i'm more into uh aircraft displays and controls
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh heads up this ways and such
 	
 	
 		well yeah stuff like that generally i'm right now my dissertation is more into auditory display but uh you know things like beats and buzzers and tones and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh so are you a Star Trek fan
 	
 	
 		uh yeah actually
 	
 	
 		i've heard a lot of really uh good thing from human factor people about the way that they
 		you know the the the bridge of the new enterprise
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah that that seems to be a pretty good pretty good thing as for as i can tell who who do you work for in Rochester
 	
 	
 		i work for a company called Western New York Computing System for twenty year old company and uh we are affiliated with MicroAge i know that
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		makes people some people squeamish but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well not me
 	
 	
 		yeah uh you know it's a it a it's fascinating work and uh
 	
 	
 		it would
 	
 	
 		never never a dull moment you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i can say you know for me
 		shoot in the last five or six years if i hadn't had access to a computer i would really be screw in a big way  you know because i've
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i had a i use to have a IBM compatible and i got my my thesis done and actually my master degree on it and now that i'm trying to work on my dissertation you know it just
 		it's really good that i've access to a Mac and stuff so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it's helped
 	
 	
 		on yeah you can just you know you can just type type type type get it all in there and make it look really excellent and uh some of some of the checkers and thing they have nowadays or
 	
 	
 		you bet
 		yeah
 		yeah you can build the fancy art work and stuff
 	
 	
 		are a real benefit
 		oh yeah sure i even seen uh you can download a three dimensional
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh Chemical CAD
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		small package that lets you draw molecule in three dimension and huh scary stuff you know
 	
 	
 		well that's pretty nifty
 		yeah well what do you think about Unix in terms of it's popularity if do you think that is going to blossom or what
 	
 	
 		well i'm a little worried about um you know uh what do they call it a government poses
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um because it could it could fragment it but the government has brought into that type of operating system know and the government seem to derive
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know there is a whole other offshoot people company will developing for that market and then turn around and sell those products into the commercial markets and so i think were going to see a lot in there it's got a lot of promise i don't
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean it's it it's been underrated um you know you can you can scale the Unix system
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to fit the need you know you can go all the way from a desktop to a mainframe
 	
 	
 		yeah now that's that's the real good thing is the versatility and everything i i've got a lot of friends that work at NASA and uh and Cape Kennedy and things and there all really like
 	
 	
 		on Unix
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		really pro Unix and like that's the future of mankind in computing you know type of thing and i'm not i'm not real certain that i agree with that but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i i'm i use to be um a very strong Apple supporter and i was a little worried about this unholy alliance that they have entered into with no with IBM
 	
 	
 		
  
 		with Microsoft
 		or with IBM yeah
 	
 	
 		but um you know there there there's a company called Talogent that's uh
 		third spin off of both of the company it's like there there spawn  and uh there working on an object oriented operating system that is going to hold a lot of promise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hum
 		no uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that's
