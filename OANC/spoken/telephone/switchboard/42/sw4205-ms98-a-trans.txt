 
     		
 	
 		what are your views Mister
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh  i think Vietnam war
 		was justified
 		but it was carried out badly
 		unfortunately politician got a hold of it
 		and it was a military victory but it was uh
 		i'd say uh a political defeat
 		what what what do you think about of world i mean the Vietnam War
 	
 	
 		well i'm just not really still not really sure why the war started
 		uh there was a conflict with the Vietnamese had conflict with the French i  i know that and they've been in a war like state for seems like most of
 		the time that their countries been prospering so they're just award tarnation
 	
 	
 		no uh from what i remember was uh
 		the French
 		had a Vietnam as a colony
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then after the war World War II
 		uh
 		Vietnam wanted to become independent of of France
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so they started an up rising and that was the French
 		and oh Chinese War
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and uh basically
 		Vietnamese Vietnamese where beating the French so we took over because we had our containment policy
 		and uh the north side of Vietnam
 		went to Russia for military aid
 		and so  we didn't want
 		so we didn't want  Vietnam  become communist
 		so that's why we started supporting the South Vietnamese Vietnamese that's how the war started
 	
 	
 		does oil come into the equation all of that is there oil in that area see oil is a a motivating factor for most of the
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		altercations that go on in the world
 	
 	
 		but it's not necessarily oil i i i know you are talking about like uh natural resources but i don't think they had that much of a natural
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		to much natural resource it's just like i said our we had a containment policy and if we didn't help the South Vietnamese
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the North Vietnamese would have definitely won and then our views in those days they would have become communist or pinko
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we didn't want that so we got into the war
 	
 	
 		what about what do you think about strategic location just as
 		if you think about it
 		Russia has Cuba which is an island outside the United States and United States has Japan that's right out side of Cuba it it does Vietnam have a any strategic location
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh
 		actually i i i really haven't considered that much
 		about a strategic location
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		hum uh
 		other than it being another country falling to the
 		to pinkos or the communist
 		no not to much real strategic
 		location
 		it's just
 		uh for for Russia to continue it has to expand if it doesn't expand it'll collapse
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so by doing our containment policy
 		we're defeating
 		Russia
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know if uh if that containment policy was was right or the best
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but
 		that was our our little view then
 	
 	
 		i sort of believe that the Vietnam because of the Vietnam war and the
 		the way that the United States exited from it that that has brought on other scrimmages and i i thinks that that's
 		some what related
 		to the
 		Gulf War because
 		it makes the American people keep safe face
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i i i agree partial with you the Vietnam War made us loose
 		loose faith uh politically
 		and and that and and to the fact that the American public
 		can't stomach war or high causality
 		so we aren't really steadfast in that regard but military we unquestionably you know unquestionably quick ass in Vietnam
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it might have had
 		probably did have some repercussions repercussions towards now you know people do
 		the enemy does know if the America takes high causality it will leave
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just like in uh
 		uh that uh a car bombing or three hundred marines were killed and we just got the hell out
 	
 	
 		from
 		um-hum
 		um-hum is this is this something in your
 		in your military in your military training that that uh suggests that that is  a um procedure of the
 		of the American way of war
 	
 	
 		uh what what is uh low causality or high causalities
 	
 	
 		right is there you know like there
