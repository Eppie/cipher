 
     		
 	
 		well i'm not much on colors for every right season i kind of wear whatever i want to wear um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i uh i buy workout clothes um i'm into fitness a lot and so i i spend money on that that gets kind of expensive
 	
 	
 		do you wear those um Lycra
 		fitness clothes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		one of my house mates has some of those things
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh she seems to like them because they stretch a lot and and give a lot when she rows
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh did she she rose oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		um-hum rowing is a real popular fitness activity in here Philadelphia
 	
 	
 		on my goodness well do are you into working out or anything
 	
 	
 		not very much my main
 		focus right now is getting my dissertation finished and so my workouts tend to be limited to going swimming
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right well what kind of clothes do you wear to work or to school
 	
 	
 		
 
 		to school i generally wear blue jeans and uh depending on the temperature a sweater and then uh a cotton polo shirt
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		is the weather pretty cold
 	
 	
 		it's been pretty cold lately it's snowing today
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness it it's probably about sixty uh sixty five degrees here
 	
 	
 		it
 		
 
 		oh i would trade
 	
 	
 		yeah it reached eighty degrees two days ago and i was in shorts and a T-shirt and i went running
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		uh yeah  and i had the wrong shoes i've just started running i i been into weigh lifting and all and i just started running and i had the wrong tennis shoes
 	
 	
 		oh now tell me about the tennis shoes for running and how what a difference that makes
 	
 	
 		well um i found out what a difference it makes i just had regular walking shoes that i was running in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it didn't give me the support i needed i had too much shock and too much jolting on my knees and my ankles and my joints and my lower back
 	
 	
 		do you go running down the sidewalk or down the street
 	
 	
 		oh well um down the sidewalks and uh on the side on the grass the side roads
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um i was running on the track and it's just carpet with uh a little thin thing of padding and then concrete and in those tennis shoes i had Reebok's on and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah Reebok walking shoes and they just did not do the job at all
 		so about a week after i started running my shin started hurting i got shin splints
 		so i went to The Athlete a shoe store here in Tyler
 		and tried on several different pairs of shoes i tried Asics and uh Nike Air and uh New Balance and some different type of tennis shoes that are running
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh finally got some Nike Air because they have the the air pockets in the front and the back
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i didn't think that it would make any difference you know i thought well that's just a sales pitch you know and Nike's real expensive because they're always putting out new things and you just pay for the brand
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i tried on i compared the way that felt to all the other brands and the prices difference difference wasn't that much you know maybe ten dollars difference
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so i finally bought some Nike Air Skylon 2 and so it it they just are wonderful it it i can run further now because i'm not in pain
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		right now my housemate's boyfriend just got he's training for a marathon and he just got some
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		some Nike Air shoes and he says that you can also run a lot further in those because you save a lot of more energy
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		my shoes i just got some new ones my old ones had blown out and my new ones are Reebok basketball shoes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i picked them out mainly because they were on a big sale
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my shoes are blue so the uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		the blue shoes the green shoes and the red shoes were about about fifteen dollars or a little bit more than fifteen dollars less than the white shoes
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i went ahead and got a blue pair of sneaks
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good
 	
 	
 		so at my house one of my old housemate's i was just was watching her give a talk over at the business college yesterday she's um looking for a permanent job right now but she
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um was talking about loss aversion which is when you hate to give something up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that you already have so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		somebody like you that's used to having good quality sneaks would really hate to give up um good quality sneaks for a better price
 		but somebody like me who's not used to having good quality sneaks would hate to pay more for better quality sneaks
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		well now when it comes to clothing like above the ankles
