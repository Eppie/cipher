 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well the main uh two recycling efforts i see in this neighborhood are at work um somebody got the idea of collecting all the phone books together and it's probably several tons of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh white paper computer paper and stuff like that and the other one would be the local grocery stores have got um
 		newspaper bins i just recently noticed a magazine bin which is really nice and now i've got a place to dump all these things but a really prominent sign is that until recently they accepted those plastic milk jugs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they're probably the main you know source of those things in the first place but they've quit taking those now
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		which is a little disturbing
 	
 	
 		uh is that because they can't do anything with them or uh
 	
 	
 		i don't know i was under the impression that they were converting or that the two liter plastic bottles could be um chipped down and used for a lot of things like uh carpet industry's pretty big in the northern part of the state here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i've heard that some of the companies make their carpets completely from that stuff but i don't know if there's any use for those strange opaque milk carton type um plastic jugs or not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i don't even know what they're made out of  urethane or
 	
 	
 		yeah they seem to be a pretty nasty kind thing whatever that is
 	
 	
 		something like that
 		yeah yeah we've actually got uh see there's several different bins at the work place and at home we've got
 		several different recycling things going on and um
 		uh at home
 		we actually have a private sanitation company that asks us to separate out all of our stuff and they take everything from car oil you know engine oil
 	
 	
 		oh very good
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is a hard one to get get rid of
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		to you know plastic milk jugs and bottles and stuff like that so we have it all sort of separated out in bags by the time he comes around he comes around a couple times a week then we have um there's a recycling center down at uh park not far from us
 		uh where if you really have big loads you can go in and separate it yourself so there's all uh you know all the different categories categories of stuff i don't know if they break it out in plastics between milk jugs and other things but i think it's like plastics glass paper
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and then uh at work this actually kind of a funny story uh
 		for a long time the the guys who ran the company i work for we're kind of resistant to uh any kind of recycling because they felt like it was just going to cost them money or something
 	
 	
 		yeah that's kind of reasonable
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh so they put up uh
 		eventually you know there's enough pressure and they put up they put up a couple different uh bins one of them was for paper which everybody gets everybody gets a paper bin in their office
 		but there're so many restrictions on what you can toss in there that it's almost more of pain than it's worth
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		no you know no clips no staples you know and so it's kind of it's kind of a pain you have to get get in that habit
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and uh the other ones uh they have for aluminum cans they also have and this is sort of the funniest part they had a styrofoam recycling thing going on
 	
 	
 		i understand
 	
 	
 		and they were actually yeah they were actually um in the uh staff meetings that we used to have there was this guy who's job it was to sort of track that and every month he would actually report how much money
 	
 	
 		never heard of that one before
 	
 	
 		of this company made on recycling and so he'd say you know and i'd like to report that we made twenty five dollars and two cents
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		on styrofoam cup recycling so we were we were always making jokes about you know maybe we could fold that over into computer purchases or something like that you know so by the year you know twenty fifty you know we could buy a  or something you know with but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's an interesting one never heard of styrofoam recycling before
 	
 	
 		yep  so
 	
 	
 		that seems like a prime candidate for recycling though
 	
 	
 		yeah for uh well they they actually took sort of the reverse approach to start with they just decided well we won't we won't let anybody use anything styrofoam  so they stopped buying coffee cups and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is a real pain you know because i mean not everybody uh wonders in with their coffee cup i mean a lot of us haven't been you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and those packing peanuts are hard to avoid in a business too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		so anyway so we we have a lot of things lot of things going on i actually i'm i'm a big uh i'm a big recycling fan i think it's pretty important actually hear about all these stories about uh
 		plastics and stuff showing up out in the ocean you know choking animals and stuff like that it's pretty pretty gory
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		yeah they'll last forever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		all these millions of years nothing has um  evolved to take care of that stuff
 	
 	
 		uh
 		there there's actually a company out um
 		uh straight west of us in Strasburg Virginia that makes arm rests for cars
 		in mass quantities in fact virtually every piece of trim that you see on the inside of your car Japanese or American these guys make
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh so it's a giant plastics plant i think they have a seventy like a seventy five percent market share or something
 	
 	
 		do they use a lot of recycled goods for their raw material
 	
 	
 		uh i think they use a lot of recycled plastic but the funny thing about it is
 		is that they have because of certain
