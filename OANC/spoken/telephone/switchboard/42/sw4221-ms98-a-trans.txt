 
     		
 	
 		so do you do any kind of regular exercise
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh what i do most regular is swim lap swimming
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and um of course i've been indoors a lot lately we've been having some really cold weather here but i prefer swimming outdoor
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um for the
 		i think i find the our door atmosphere more inspiring for my exercise really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh a little less claustrophobic
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and um i just thought i always fill a little more lively um i think when i the times when i do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or wouldn't having to pass on to the gym maybe to work with weight the weight machine um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it just a little more spacious yeah like you said claustrophobic
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what do you do for exercise
 	
 	
 		well very little lately what i do  i walk about a mile to the bus
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that a mile a good way each way
 	
 	
 		in the morning yeah and
 		and then then a mile back
 	
 	
 		well that's good two miles a day is nothing to  at
 	
 	
 		it's it's a lot better then nothing i think
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i've just recently um something i tried to incorporate into life style just recently is walking when i'm going short distances like when i'm at work if i'm going to go to a restraint for lunch just choosing one close enough to walk
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's nice i think it really clears your head a little bit
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah and i think one of the um probably i i think
 		that one of the most important thing about  enjoying your exercise and getting it regularly just to have it in your life style like and not be like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		six o'clock at night and well now i've got to go
 	
 	
 		well that's one that's one reason i actually do the walking where i tried other thing is it has a point to it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's really is part of what i need to do anyway you know i need to get to the bus
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's finite too you know you eventually reach the bus you don't reach your two miles and say well i really should walk that extra mile
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's find i right
 		right right it's something i had to do where when i tried you know running around the track i felt just a little pointless
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was very easy to avoid
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		very easy
 	
 	
 		and i'm i'm trying to do some um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		some you know calisthenic type thing at home
 	
 	
 		oh are you really
 	
 	
 		but it's very easy to avoid
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um one calisthenic type thing that i i feel like i i feel like i have gotten to do and eventually with out having to think about it do is
 		just squatting down when i going to pick something up instead of bending over at the waist
 	
 	
 		uh
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and um i can i think i fill like i can already tell the difference in my thighs just i have a little more definition
 	
 	
 		that's very interesting  something probably better for you anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah and i
 		yeah and that what that what started it with a little bit of back trouble i was having and of course i didn't want to do leg lift or anything
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right are those are then  of the painful and sort of artificial category
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right  that's right
 	
 	
 		well i was just i one of the issues i want to do is try to avoid some back pain or try to
 		i mean i have it every once and a while and i know when i do this exercise i don't get it which is it call it crunches
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		we kind of do a sit-ups
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		together i'm just going to ignore that call waiting if you heard it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah where you sort of try to put ribcage into your pelvis and do it over and over again
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that would defiantly fall in the unnatural category
 	
 	
 		yes it does it does and i always find a good reason not to do it
 		um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i can tell that i haven't done it
 	
 	
 		no
 		this girlfriend of mines got a pretty flat stomach not i don't really but i don't i was asking her because she does not she's one of those who just doesn't exercise you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and um but she said she you know just you know hold her stomach in all day i mean you know just constantly holds it in all day
 	
 	
 		oh yes i trying to decided if that was good or not good
 	
 	
 		well i'm sure it would be good for your back it seems like it might impede impede you know impede your breathing a little bit in less  really use to it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um
 	
 	
 		what do you think
 	
 	
 		yeah i i mean i found myself doing it
 		i mean i sort of been in that habit through out my life and  lately it's uh lately it's not
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		hasn't been happen quit as much
 	
 	
 		yeah i i was in it for a while um
 		when i was in high school i took um choral and you have to hold your you know just to regulate your breathing  you had
 	
 	
 		uh-huh you don't stand very carefully
 	
 	
 		yeah but i found like the top half of my stomach above above my belly button was
 		getting you know was always tone but then the the trouble spot below the belly button
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		never never quit tone you know  and you know that was the part i was concern about so i just blew it all off all together
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah um  and what else lately along with the crunches i was trying to do some push-ups
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		uh well my wife is
 		we're expecting a baby in May
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i know that from the last time what she really like is to have a lot of very hard back rubs during the whole thing and i'm just not ready for it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i thought well if i can do a bunch of push-up then i should be able to get through these this time
 		but uh i have the problem now where we have a son who is almost three
 		and he think that it is great fun to try to climb on my back while i'm doing the push-up so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that could you know slow you down a little bit it's just that extra resistance and
 	
 	
 		it's slows me down a little it makes each one a little more meaningful but i can't quit do any
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um do you do any exercises for your hand the little muscle in your hand
 	
 	
 		um
 		no what what what are you thinking
