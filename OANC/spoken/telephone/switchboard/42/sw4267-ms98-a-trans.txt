 
     		
 	
 		all right so what do you think about gun control or what how do you rate on a one to ten scale your feelings about gun control
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i guess i'd probably put myself on about a five i'm kind of in the middle on that
 		i think that there's uh there are some guns that i just can't think of any reason why anybody would want to have them unless they just want to go shoot somebody
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but on the other hand i think there's a lot of legitimate use for guns too and i don't see any reason why we should do any sort of control or uh
 		certainly no sort of you know serious restrictions on those for example hunting and things like that and even some self-defense things so how do you feel about it
 	
 	
 		i'd probably be closer to uh on the one side
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i don't really see the need for it um typically only thing that ever gets produced you know that occurs when you have one is you end up shooting some family member or some kid in the house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's about the only good that ever comes from it
 	
 	
 		i don't know i know some people who hunt and uh you know
 	
 	
 		well i yeah you could i mean but do they necessarily have to keep them at home to do that
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i mean maybe there's a way they can be uh maintained in a a certain location i don't know but i don't know if individual ownership is necessary
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well it seems like most of the people who get hurt from them get hurt from handguns
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so i look at somebody like you know who's got a you know maybe a a twenty two caliber rifle or something like that if you know good for
 		for you know maybe hunting some small you know animal or something like that you know i never i never hear a reports of people you know shooting each other with things like that unless they're out in the woods and drunk and then of course that's a that's another problem
 	
 	
 		right
 		but
 		
 
 		that's true
 		right that's true
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		yeah mostly i guess handguns are are create the problems but a lot of people would come back and say well uh you they need it for shooting range and that sort of thing but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		once again i think it it may be better to keep the guns uh there and let they can go there and and use them if that's all they need it for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah i agree that there's a real problem with uh with injuries and things like that uh sound like we both agree on the fact that things like semiautomatic rifles and and things like that i mean they uh
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i think we both agree that there's there's no uh at least use that i legitimate use that i can think of for a semiautomatic rifle except to kill people i mean that's what they were designed for and that's what they're good for
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now you know i suppose if if there was some way that we could render them unusable
 	
 	
 		well they can always be tweaked around and made deadly once again
 	
 	
 		then
 		yeah
 		yeah i guess if there were some absolute definite way that you could you could make something like that unusable then i  then i probably wouldn't have a problem with a collector having one
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i don't know how to do that uh without you know even pouring cement down the barrels probably way to get around that
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i don't openly i don't i think any gun any gun can be modified to to certain a certain extent to be used as a weapon
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so without a total ban there's always going to be guns available but
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think even with a total ban there'll always be guns available
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but at that point you know i guess i don't realistically think there's anything you can do about that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know you you can certainly make the possession of of of of such weapons you know
 		you know the penalties for that very very very strict
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i i guess i feel like you know just like anything else you know you know there's lots of illegal things out there that people that people are you know still getting
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i also ascribe to the theory that you know you know guns guns don't kill people people kill people i mean that that seems to me to be wrong
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think i think guns do kill people and that you know you know let's face it i mean if you got a gun
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		it's so much easier in the heat of an argument or something to to hurt somebody than it is with a knife or
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		right that's yeah for example what happened just the other evening uh Evander Holyfield's brother
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know they had some kind of disagreement or whatever and next thing you knew he was shot and dead
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right but you know it's interesting there was an incident here in Rochester a a few days ago where uh some people were having a real heavy argument and the guy pulled out a knife and killed the other two people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you know it it it goes to show it it does prove that even even you know gun gun control certainly has a place but it's not going to be the the cure all of all society's ills
 	
 	
 		sure sure but i guess uh
 		if you look at the NRA's position on it they tend to say that they don't want they really don't want to have any restrictions because they feel that once you get one and it's starts it be gets easier and it may snowball into more restrictions i don't really respect that position
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think they're kind of getting out of touch with reality in some of their stances
 	
 	
 		no i
 		i think that's an extremist position and i and i don't really subscribe to it either
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i think on the you know like i said i think there are some legitimate
 		you know uses for guns and that's why i kind of put myself at a five but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
