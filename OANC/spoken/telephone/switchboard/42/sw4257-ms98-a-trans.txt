 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um at what age did your father enter the  nursing home
 	
 	
 		um he was around seventy nine i believe
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		and um but it's a big decision to make but um you know people say because one day they're they look like they're doing real well and the next they're just you know awful in diapers and the whole bit
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um uh they can be mentally sane one day and just look perfectly normal and then the next day they're just
 		are weeks off of off of it and until you take care of a person personally there were three my mom and i and our kids would help us some and it was just awful to take care of a person that is that way
 	
 	
 		i tell you i worked in home health care with the elderly um for a while and uh while i was in college and it was a very i mean i enjoyed my job but i i worked a
 	
 	
 		uh uh very strenuous
 	
 	
 		yes three days on and four days off is what my schedule was and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i'm a compassionate person and uh physically strong but when i got off my three day shift i mean you know you couldn't have kept me there another minute i just had to go
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		right yes but i don't know how the the uh people at the nursing homes handle it day in and day out truthfully because of the physical
 		strain uh as well as uh you know emotionally well they they have to build walls emotionally but
 	
 	
 		it um-hum
 		i i think that's almost necessary i and it's interesting that compassion has got to be a required quality but then they yet they have to have the ability to isolate themselves from too much too much compassion
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum from the situation um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		was very difficult for me at times as the as the daughter to you know to a special person
 	
 	
 		i could imagine
 		oh of course uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but anyway anyway he he um the the requirements for the nursing home were first of all well of course the cleanliness and the care
 		you know what type of care do they need it depends if you you know if you need the bed total bed care
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or if he could if they could be up and around it all depends on the type of nursing home they have the ones where they live in apartments even and just get their meals and care there you know that way
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so that that's one of the i mean it just depends on the patients
 	
 	
 		that's true and i think it would be i would think it would be helpful to the patient to um be housed with uh patients with similar uh had you know similar problems
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		if you will you know excuse the word
 		just so that they could relate to one another and and wouldn't you know be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		except bless their hearts they're  usually so senile they don't really do anything  love each other and and all they do is fight with each other that was i found in my father you know all those old people would just fight with you it was a riot
 	
 	
 		i know
 		i i tell you i was at an uh convalescent home last week um a three hundred and twenty five patient convalescent home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i could not believe how feisty these people were i had never i had never been in a group atmosphere when i was in home health care it was a one-on-one ratio
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and these folks were you know about to go to the mat over TV stations that they had chosen or
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh arguing over whether or not their meals were cooked enough and and as if the another patient could have done something about it
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and i find that psychologically very interesting because i i feel from my perspective that it would be a a manifestation of their own frustration
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm going to ignore that click if you heard it uh
 	
 	
 		oh that's fine yeah
 	
 	
 		and and that um would would i don't know that that frustration would be preventable in
 		
 
 		even in the one-on-one ratio i worked in my patients were very frustrated and very upset
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it is for them bless their hearts it is very frustrating but but by the same token it's it's the one my father was in was wonderful care
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that i'm sure that was a load off your mind
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah it is and uh just knowing they're daily taken care of as far as uh physically and uh
 		you know they they kept him clean and they kept him
 		and uh kept up with his medicine and all it's a big thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum what um do they did you find um that they offered sufficient dietary maintenance that would be something i would
 	
 	
 		it was pretty good it was nothing to write home about it's typical you know it's typical um
 	
 	
 		would uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh what do you want to say you know um
 		commercial you know and uh it was it was fine they had but they had a recreation director that was pretty good there and she made sure they had their little get togethers and parties most everyday she had something going on for them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		either ceramics or they did ceramics which i never thought my dad would do but he did a little bit of it
