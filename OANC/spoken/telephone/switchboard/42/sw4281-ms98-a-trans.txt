 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well yes
 	
 	
 		so so  do you do much exercising
 	
 	
 		uh only for fun
 		i really enjoy it though
 		so uh let's see what do i do in the winter i play volleyball
 	
 	
 		yeah what do
 	
 	
 		and i go skiing that's about it
 	
 	
 		oh you go skiing eh
 		yeah well out here in the west you've got some nice places to go skiing
 	
 	
 		well i must admit that Utah has the best snow on earth
 	
 	
 		
 
 		anyway
 		um i haven't been in a regular exercising program do you have a regular program that you actually you know stick to or
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		do you have it planned out or is
 		it just you do exercise for recreation recreation
 	
 	
 		yeah it you know i do it for the fun i can't stand
 		say stationary bicycle
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		gets pretty boring or
 		like uh
 		you know lifting weights because i can't count more than to three before i get bored and then i lose track of the repetitions
 		but uh the uh
 		you know the the gym's open say for volleyball on every Wednesday so so that's regular
 	
 	
 		so you go
 		so you like regularly do volleyball yeah i used to i used to regularly run and then about a year and a half ago i had some back problems
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i haven't been able to get out and run and i have really noticed it in a year and a half i've gone from being fit to being
 		a vegetable i feel like such a vegetable now
 		but
 	
 	
 		so you must be over twenty then
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm over twenty i'm
 		going down the gentle slope
 	
 	
 		yeah when you're about when you're under twenty five you can pretty much get away with uh doing nothing and then when you want to get do something something athletic you just get up and do it
 		otherwise i find you've got to every week
 		everyday
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if you want to have any sort of shape
 	
 	
 		yeah so anyway i'm looking forward to the Spring as it comes around to trying to get back into running now that i'm
 	
 	
 		running that doesn't bother your knees at all
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		great
 	
 	
 		no i've never had problems with my knees at all
 		um
 		uh the
 		that's not not at all a problem it's more just uh
 		the other thing i do is i run with my wife and so we go kind of out together
 		and we don't run hard like like we jog and like kind of just go see places and kind of
 		run around together and it's not like we go real hard or anything but it's enjoyable
 	
 	
 		well it's hard to get no exercise while running i mean you pretty much got to move don't you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well you do i mean it's it's really jogging but i mean you can push yourself at different levels how hard you run
 	
 	
 		well even just walking
 		well but you know like say riding a bike where if you go really slow it's pretty much coasting you're not even doing anything
 		and just to move while running you've got to move your legs every single step
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so you don't you don't feel you're getting a good exercise when you go out uh jogging
 	
 	
 		oh i do but i don't feel that it's that hard  i  it's not that stressful you know you're asking about how it was on the knees or on the body and that stuff and it's not
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		it's not really stressful at all in any i mean it's it's fun and it's enjoyable and it's good exercise but
 	
 	
 		all right yeah it's not supposed to hurt i just find that it really pounds
 		because i'm in particular running
 	
 	
 		you you do you run
 	
 	
 		
  
 		no
 		no that's i and i'd like to because i think it'd be fun
 		i run in connection with you know in case i accidentally play basketball or uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you know football you know something there's all sorts of activities where you end up running
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		it's just
 		sort of a natural thing
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but i don't do it just for the sake of running
 	
 	
 		how about swimming for a while i used to swim
 	
 	
 		yeah you know swimming is something i've gotten to the point where i action actually can do laps now
 	
 	
 		uh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that used to bore bore me to tears you know i'd love to swim if it was water polo or
 		you know splashing about or
 		you know if there was some diversion
 		just uh but but that's good exercise
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm looking forward to that it's i can
 	
 	
 		does this extend out from like high school or something like that
 		athletics or anything that you used to do in high school
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i used to run some cross country in high school but
 	
 	
 		yeah see that that gets back to this lack of discipline and training i i would never join a team because they'd want you to do these repetitions or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		rather than let just play the game
