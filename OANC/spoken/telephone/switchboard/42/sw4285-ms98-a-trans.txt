 		right
 		um-hum a big one it is and and uh getting out to the suburbs heavily
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it is
 	
 	
 		yeah and i work in a high school here and we're just starting to see weapons in the high school in the suburbs and that's scary
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 		what do you think is uh
 	
 	
 		much different situation than we had even three years ago you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well you know we we i live in a uh in a city that's uh twenty five about twenty five thousand and it's in the northeast and we really don't have a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a crime problem and we have the burglaries and the occasional bank robbery and things like that but nothing uh real serious nothing like a big city crime
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but from my observations it seems to me that uh that drugs seem to be the engine driving crime in American cities today what do you think
 	
 	
 		right i think it's the basis for every for it all really it's a big part of what our problem is and this gang situation which is which
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		the need for money
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		comes from you know the drugs are involved in it but it the gang situation is very serious here also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i guess that's serious in uh California too in Los Angeles and some of the other cities there
 	
 	
 		right
 		right but even in our suburbs here and in our school we're you know we're
 		it's not a noticeable down the hall thing you know yelling in our suburb but it's still is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		enough that you know which one's you pretty well pick out which ones are in the gang type
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and are the gangs uh selling are they in enterprise are they selling drugs is that one of the reasons for gangs
 	
 	
 		well one one of it right but another thing is just territory you know they just want to
 		control things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		but drugs is a major is is the major i would say
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		problem of them all all of our crime you know the basis of it
 	
 	
 		right i think if somehow or other we can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		continue to crack down on drugs uh that i think it will help reduce the crime because the need for money and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and also the lack of judgement that comes from using drugs uh
 		you know people i think have a diminished capacity to know right from wrong when they're using drugs
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um
 		we also have um
 		oh we have a lot of our um counselors and all they've come up with so many groups that they didn't use to have to have you know as far as the counseling and coming up with the student groups student help groups
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		of course the the say no to drugs and this and um
 		Students Against Drunk Driving is very big in our school
 	
 	
 		that's big up here to and and
 	
 	
 		SADD which is very big
 	
 	
 		right
 		right and i think that's an effective program
 	
 	
 		i do but uh us all that basis that they start but i i think they're probably finally
 		uh realizing that they have to start in the primary grades
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		training these kids and i some of the programs you see on the TV i haven't seen a whole lot of them in our schools here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um some of the programs that they're showing in the primary where they're starting out right in the first second kindergarten grades
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		having the um
 		plays you know plays the whole thing role playing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		teaching the dangers of it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum but they off drugs i think it's a good situation
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's that's true i think
 	
 	
 		and i think it's going to have to start there because it's not working you know it overall it's such a large payola and all in the actual when it when it gets up to the
 		older people and the um law enforcement and all that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think that's being paid off big time
 	
 	
 		do you have a program called DARE down there also right well that's that's uh active up here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right but that's all recent you know that's all been in the last three about four years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that they've come in with all of those
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and had to so and and the alcohol is a big there another big you know well the drugs is part of the alcohol is the drugs but i mean alcohol is also a major problem  these kids that are you know
 		tenth graders come into school all all ready loaded that's pretty scary
 	
 	
 		sure is you find that uh do you find is it your observation that most of the crime is in a certain age group
 		certain range of ages twenty five something like or
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah not not really necessarily no not necessarily anymore yes it used to be
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		but anymore you'd find a lot of the younger thirteen fourteen in that age group
 	
 	
 		oh is that right um
 	
 	
 		is um starting heavily into it
 	
 	
 		how about the gang membership that seems to be mainly teenagers
 	
 	
 		caliber
 		and that's mainly uh so far
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's pretty well into the teenagers you know in the teenagers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they usually start that around junior
