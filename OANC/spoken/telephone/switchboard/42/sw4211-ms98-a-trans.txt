 
     		
 	
 		okay uh well what do you think is there something wrong with public schools
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well
 		i'm not so that i am not willing to send my kids to them
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah now that's partly because i want my children to have a religious education uh which a public school can not and should not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		offer uh but it's also because
 	
 	
 		right
 		you feel they get a better education
 	
 	
 		i fill that they'll get a better education i fill that i have more control over
 		uh the type of social
 		pressure that they get expose to because i can choose
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know if the kinds of essential not only am i choosing the kind of schooling that they're getting but i am also choosing the other kinds of children who are going to be there because
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it works both you know because not only am i doing this but presuming the other parents are doing the same thing
 	
 	
 		right
 		right they have the same motivation for sending their children their well i think there is a problem with with the public school education system and i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it is demonstrating by the fact so many people uh graduating from high school and can't even uh perform
 		some simple uh math problems and uh or or even read a a decent uh book uh or geography i mean some of them can't even identify the states United States or various places in the world so
 		i think that we are sending uh some some children out into the world with a very poor education foundation and i think that the problem started when the National Education Association stop being
 		for education and really became more of a labor union and only put their main entrance in teachers pay like education like money was the the solution to every thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that the i think the answer is something what you are doing right now i think that a voucher system or some competition between schools to give uh parents a choice of where they send their children to schools and allowing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh the school to compete with one another the become better i think that is the American way
 	
 	
 		well i think i i think that that works too uh
 		you know i
 		i sometimes wonder there a a school system near me that they actually a fairly good one what they've done is they had one school that was
 		because of the neighborhood the neighborhood school system basic the school system basically and they put their talented and gifted program in the poorest school district you know the or the poorest poorest elementary district that was part of this larger district
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um they allowed any of those neighborhood children who wanted to stay there to stay and then they didn't it wasn't that they had the talented and gifted program just housed in this building
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		all of the classes were based on talented and gifted and all the kids were treated the same way and as a result this is now the best school in the school district which is really kind of interesting
 	
 	
 		that's
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		a magnetic school
 	
 	
 		well it's essentially a magnetic school that's right but it's also a neighborhood school you know and
 		the neighborhood there are some of the neighborhood kids who can't manage and
 		the talented and gifted program because
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think it's more case of
 		you know there are some children in this world who i accuse of perhaps  you know and and they just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		not only can not compete they simple didn't you know those kids really felt uncomfortable but the majority of kids if they're taught the way that they teach talented and gifted kids it turns out the majority of kids really are that way
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know each one a little bit different but each one has a lot to offer so that's a public school that works but then there are other public schools in that same district that really don't work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		and unfortunately even that school although it seems to be working academically has
 		some um some real race problems that uh which is real unfortunate because most of the kids who comes in are white and most of the kids who are there are black or
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i think part of the problem with the education system really isn't the education system but it really has to do with the loss of the family structure in the United States and the loss values of
 		uh you know the guidance that went along with the stable family structure isn't isn't there for all the kids like it use to be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think you right i think you right and i think that a caring teacher
 		can do a lot to change that but then you are not talking about is it a public school is it a private school is it you talking about you know are you and the kids are going to be lucky enough to hit the teacher who can get home
