 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		i guess if i was going to advise a parent on um
 		well you know maybe how to help their their child choose a college the first thing i'd be interested in is what's the child interested in doing i mean do they have a a a major that they'd want to be interested in you know courses that they'd want to be taking um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then the second thing i'd probably look at is uh what they can afford
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know in terms of you know how much money do they have or does the child have to pay are there any scholarships or anything that they could uh
 		manage either you know through maybe an open system or maybe from a school itself
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then kind of go from there you know that's kind of where i'd start
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's uh those are some good thoughts i
 		i found for myself that to start off at a junior college in your local community and find
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that way what you do is that you find what topics you're interested in because you really you can project say a you know uh a say
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a student out of high school they might think that they have some interests but they haven't explored everything so they don't really know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so if they go to a junior college and and start taking some general education classes and things if they look through the catalog and think they find things that they're interested in
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		well then they can they really they can really find what they're interests are and then it plus it's also a lot more more inexpensive to do it that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and be and then
 		then then they can choose a college and then they can they can transfer
 		yeah i guess uh the location is um is something you know it's uh whether they want to be close to their family or whether you know uh farther away or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i think those are good points i think one thing i might i might differ with or or maybe we would agree on this is that uh i think there's some i think there some kids who who probably don't really know what they want to take
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you they don't have any work experience or whatever maybe they've taken some classes in high school or something like that i think the advice you give is is excellent for that i think on the other hand there are there are student there are students out there who know what they want to take
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i might advise them to jump right in and
 		and find you know a good school that they you know that has good standing uh in that area you know has a good faculty has a good reputation
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		uh that's what i did
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i knew what i wanted and i was i was i was exactly almost exactly right
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		it just that just helps the decision process when you know what's available because when you're when you're a a kid in school high school and stuff like this is it you're only
 		cognizant of sort of your immediate area environment and surroundings so you just don't know what's there you might just you know like go oh wow that's neat you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but another another thing and this is i think is really important is that the college hype okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they send this they send these brochures and uh pamphlets and stuff to the the students and you know send us this money and we're going to give you these services and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that isn't so they they're they're they're two horses of of three different colors and i had an experience uh i had to i stayed in the dormitory
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i they forced you to have a mean plan okay and so you were forced to go to the dining room and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the food was terrible you were you were treated like a second rate human being and the dormitory was hinged on a Nazi concentration camp
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and you just you just really didn't have any you know any rights and you just just it's just really structure like that and so one of my main suggestions would be to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for the parents to go to the college and just
 		spend some time and talk to people if they want to send their student to the dorm well go to the talk to some people in there you know talk to the people and get the true information because as i said it's it they're just that's just two different things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah i knew uh
 		i i think that's a good idea and in general i think it's a good idea to to go to the school i mean once once you've narrowed down
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		two or to to two or three or whatever number you know go visit the school school you know both the parents and and the student
 	
 	
 		right
 		alright but don't fall for the you know the the student the school tour and and all the hype don't fall for it because that's that's not because once you get in there sometimes you you make these commitments and you're not able to change them you know commitments so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah i mean and that's the thing you have to sit down and look at the uh
 		at the individual needs you know i've you know there there some there some students who even as freshmen would be ready to go live in an apartment and and start cooking there own meals and everything but there some who wouldn't be
 	
 	
 		oh exactly
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		i had a very good experience i was in the dorms for three or four out of my four years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i had a really good dorm experience
