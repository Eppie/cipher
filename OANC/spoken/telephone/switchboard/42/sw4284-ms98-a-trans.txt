 
     		
 	
 		have any children
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no uh i'm single and but i've i been keeping an eye on what the child care situation is and i have several friends that do have children
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well what do you think about child care i mean i don't have any children
 		so
 	
 	
 		well it's it's uh it's
 		i i feel that uh regulation uh uh whether be at the state or federal level is a must so we can have some sort of standards from one place to another uh
 		that uh in terms of cleanliness uh the ratio between the uh adults to children is maintained uh
 		food and so on
 		i don't think one person one adult should have like twenty children to keep after
 	
 	
 		well
 		well do you think that how many children do you think they should be allowed
 		or should be in one facility at one time
 	
 	
 		well the facility i i don't have a problem with it's just how many adults or how many children to an adult and if if i remember correctly um
 		one adult for six children was very good
 		for around here and was more twelve to twelve children one to one adult was about the average
 	
 	
 		but then and well in public school um you have one teacher for every thirty kids
 	
 	
 		and so on but the but in day care usually the child is not able to um
 		function totally on his own whether if it's if it's uh a toddler
 		uh diapers have to be changed uh must be tended to constantly
 		for fear that they might get into something
 	
 	
 		well um do you think
 		that there is enough child care available in your area
 	
 	
 		i think there is it's just that sometimes location makes it difficult if if if i was married there is no place between my house and work
 		that is convenient that i could uh use as for child care
 		they're usually in areas where they can they can afford to set up shop and not where it's convenient for the people that are working
 	
 	
 		um-hum well do you think that employers should provide child care
 	
 	
 		well some companies i've noticed will provide the facilities and then let a let a uh a company come in and provide the child care while the employer's just providing providing the the facility
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in many cases like in large companies that becomes a perk to the employees where they're able to get reduced child care and in and in the case of uh new mothers they're able to go
 		uh instead of a cigarette break they can go see their child for ten minutes and then go back to work
 		you have a better retention then of um people by not having them go on sick leave or uh paid holiday to take care of their children and so it saves the company money it's in the company's best interest
 	
 	
 		well i think that really am i am
 		all for employers providing some kype type of child care
 		or at least the facility and i don't think we really have enough of that
 	
 	
 		no it's it's it's a relatively new idea from what i understand
 		it's has uh enough companies haven't gotten on the bandwagon they where they could see a realization and um savings of money right now by people being at work and not taking off and being at home
 		if you make it convenient for them people will stay uh stay
 		or stay with the company if you if there're more perks like that you can give them
 		it's not just money it's it's everything about it and child care is a big issue
 		it's important to me if i was married and had children
 		i'd want to be as close to my kids as i possibly could
 	
 	
 		oh i know and i think that if i had children and i couldn't find adequate child care i probably wouldn't want to work
 	
 	
 		i'm the same way but then again how do you provide for the child when you can't work
 	
 	
 		you you i know you really don't have a choice
 		but then um
 		i'm my boss had
 		a case where um
 		his baby got sick in child care
 		and um
 		all the babies at the child care place that he went to all came down with an ear infection and that's
 		i think there should be some kind of um health regulation or or
 		some kind of i don't know how bad i mean i can see how it could happen with all the children there together
 	
 	
 		um-hum
