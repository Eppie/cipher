 
     		
 	
 		okay i'll just go with you first what kind of eating out do you enjoy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay  well i like dining out of course it means that i don't have to cook but um i'm a divorced woman i have one child and you know when when we dine out
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we go to like medium priced restaurants i don't i don't particularly i think it's sort of a waste of money to go real to a real high priced restaurant
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do you go like home cooking like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria
 	
 	
 		um yeah um
 		not really we go  more for the um Chinese and Italian and stuff like that Mexican stuff that i can't cook  yeah
 	
 	
 		me too
 		uh-huh
 		Mexican uh-huh uh we do too we do the same what are your favorite places
 	
 	
 		um well i like Chinese food um uh there's a little place down on what is that Coit Road um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Chinese Pavilion or something that is really good and i like it and um i do i do like Chinese buffets
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah well we go we've gone to August Moon and we think that was real good but our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to Taiwan or May Dragon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and those are excellent they're really a nice place you could take someone to eat it's not the the rinky-dink Chinese decorations but it's a very elegant nice place to eat  we go
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		very very often we go out for fajitas that's my husband's just gotten stuck and we go to On the Border
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and lots of places that have uh i think Costa Rosa and some of those and get fajitas and he'll just eat chips till we've got three or four baskets coming back
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then uh last weekend we went out for Italian also and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to wanna go eat  lasagna and  garlic bread  so we went to El Sorrento
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh uh-huh have yeah have you ever um tried Pappasito's
 	
 	
 		and it was fun
 		you know what this is that's real funny you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church and Bob pointed to it and he said i keep hearing good things about that place we're gonna have to go
 	
 	
 		oh it is delicious
 	
 	
 		that's what he said that in fact you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i guess we'll have to do it he
 	
 	
 		it's you always stand in line when you go but it's worth the wait
 	
 	
 		that's what that's what it D Magazine said that it said there was always a line but that's probably i mean that's a good that's a good sign
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh  and have you ever tried um the Macaroni Grill up on
 	
 	
 		yes we did now my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or lasagna and most of those things were a little more northern Italy
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they like just the traditional they're not very
 	
 	
 		that they're they're the Spaghetti Warehouse type  right yeah yeah  my little girl likes uh Spaghetti Warehouse real well  it's real entertaining for her
 	
 	
 		yes they are exactly  exactly the place of the seventies
 		um-hum yeah most kids do  what do you ever go for steak just a steak and potato and salad bar that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		um
 		not really that's a steak something that i cook at home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know that that you grill out and i really don't particularly um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'm i'm real curious to try this one that has such horrid commercials the uh that Del Lincoln and
 		oh what is that guy's name they do those real corny commercials
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it's um over there's one over there in Addison
 		i can't remember his name anyhow it's some
 	
 	
 		steak
 	
 	
 		yeah it's some famous steak place over in Addison there's a there's a second one downtown
 		and they have these really corny radio commercials but their steak their steak is supposed to be wonderful so i had i had not tried that my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it seems like i've been we we found those one time and then they discontinued it was over in Addison and then they um closed up  so most of these places are pretty much just uh theme restaurants around here
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yes
 		right i think that's what goes you know really goes right now in the in the Dallas area of course you know down
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		next to downtown up around McKinney and everything you know there's just a there's a different class
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that's exactly true  that's right
 	
 	
 		of restaurants up there that i can't even touch
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		you know it'd probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and  have one meal up there but um
 	
 	
 		that's even  yeah that's right
 		uh-huh
 		i had a friend who was taken to Lawry's downtown for prime rib and i haven't been we usually don't go for beef really anymore we're we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's that's usually the way we'll go if we're not going lasagna
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		right um-hum
 		um-hum yeah when when i go out it's it's normally to get um some specialty type of food besides you know because you chicken and steaks and everything i grill at home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		i know well i understand
 	
 	
 		and and really it's they're a lot better than what i get in the restaurant  that's right  saves you a little bit money
 	
 	
 		that's right and save you some money too
 		well now what your what's your child's favorite place to eat
 	
 	
 		um
 		favorite place uh she has a lot Taco Bell  yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  they're easy  yeah  well
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		mine enjoy that too they like to go pretty much where we like to go and they'll and then our favorite thing on Fridays we generally order pizza in so not Pizza Inn but pizza to our house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we've done that well um is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it i think we've i think it's come to a nice conclusion so i'll talk with you later thank you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		no not that i know of
 		uh-huh thank you bye-bye
