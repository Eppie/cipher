 
     		
 	
 		okay while i was waiting for you to connect i i thought of a couple of menus i decided it'd to be if it's informal or not you know if it was informal i'd probably choose something i mean just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because that's a lot of fun especially this time of year where it's so nice out
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um
 		it was formal i'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something i'm not  i'm not into formal dinner parties but
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		i'd probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread
 	
 	
 		so what what do you use for cookbooks
 	
 	
 		um i have a Pillsbury cookbook i got when i was married but it's kind of the bible of cooking for me then i have some from like church
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		that are more family recipes that are more useful  you know budget cookbooks but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and of course you get a lot from when you're growing up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i cook a lot the same as as my mom did of course i've added several different recipes but what would you serve or what would you
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i i i think we come from from different backgrounds um so the the
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		i i i start with different you know have different perspectives that you are i find the Joy of Cooking to be a remarkably useful book to to fall back on because it has almost everything in it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but on the other hand  it's not very inspiring uh it's a good reference when you need to dig something up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what we've find very useful is a a book called The Thirty Minute Cookbook i think that's the title uh by Marion Burrows
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes you know the whole meal
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be wonderful in these times
 	
 	
 		and so she's
 		yeah now now i i find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah either they're really fast or
 	
 	
 		but but they're but they're but they're interesting they're interesting menus um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		combinations that you wouldn't have normally thought of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		what's one of your favorites
 	
 	
 		um gee the one i had most recently was was one that was had  she she describes as Jim Beard's favorite um summer menu or something and it consisted of
 		uh grilled kielbasa sausage um a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		potato salad with olive oil
 		and uh some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there
 	
 	
 		wow sounds pretty good
 	
 	
 		um and that and that was you know that's that that's certain you can do in thirty minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but there are a whole lot of you know i mean i i would recommend you look at that book if you're if you are a busy person Thirty Minute Cookbook
 	
 	
 		yeah those Thirty Minute Cookbook
 		that sounds fun i find a lot of the cookbooks that i don't know that you buy over the counter
 		ask for really strange ingredients or things i don't keep on hand all the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i have young children and our budget's set you know at this time but i want to use
 		simple recipes that i have things on hand i don't have to run to the store to buy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or look for something i haven't heard of  so that's why sometimes i shy away from uh more of a traditional cookbooks but
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but  well it was interesting talking to you it's a fun subject food is one of my favorite things too
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		anything else you wanted to add
 	
 	
 		well you had said dinner
 		you know you know what would i put together for a formal dinner we had we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night and and um
 	
 	
 		oh wow um-hum
 	
 	
 		put here here the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert
 		well you know a chocolate mousse recipe
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's good
 	
 	
 		and a sort of palate cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken Marabella
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um which is this wonderful thing you can do um
 		basically you're baking baking chicken in a in an open pan um having marinated it first hand my my wife did this part so i don't remember all the details but it's marinated in olive oil and some seasoning
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and cooked with some olives and some and some prunes uh there's a little bit of brown sugar in there and it bakes up it's a delicious thing and it's easy
 	
 	
 		that sounds good
 	
 	
 		comparatively so i
 	
 	
 		that sounds really good
 	
 	
 		um
 		i'm sorry i just love food
 	
 	
 		it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am i'm pretty simple right now but
 	
 	
 		well maybe we had a little more leisure time to do it i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah that's probably that's true i have little ones and we and they won't eat you know too many different foods right now so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i found my kids were very frustrating when they were little
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in terms of their tastes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on the other hand sometimes it was easy they'd you know canned ravioli was was one of their favorites and so it was easy to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah spaghetti's a pretty  staple every other week or so  so and it goes a long ways too so
 	
 	
 		open a can of ravioli or
 		yes
 		well nice talking to you Cheryl
 	
 	
 		all righty we'll talk to you later maybe
 	
 	
 		okay bye
