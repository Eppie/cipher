 		oh God i don't know anybody's name um  um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like Peter Murphy or um
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah i'm not i'm not that crazy about the Bauhaus um i liked Joy Division a lot and
 	
 	
 		trying to think what else Simple Minds
 		um-hum
 		um-hum you probably know a lot more about music than i do i just listen to it while i'm driving basically uh i don't even have a stereo at the moment
 	
 	
 		oh oh maybe right
 		um-hum
 		oh how horrible how  how can you live like that um
 	
 	
 		so uh-huh
 		um-hum it's pretty hard
 	
 	
 		right um let's see and
 	
 	
 		um
 		but soul you know i like everybody um don't die but  i like Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer and um um the Jacksons Michael
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		okay
 		um-hum yes i think
 	
 	
 		Terrance
 	
 	
 		right least the Jacksons i can agree with you
 	
 	
 		Terence Trent D'Arby uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum yeah you like stuff like Prince
 	
 	
 		just everybody yeah i like him except for his latest song Cream i could live without
 	
 	
 		and
 		his what
 	
 	
 		his latest song Cream i could live without
 	
 	
 		okay uh let's see yeah i think i heard that
 	
 	
 		but like Purple Rain i liked
 	
 	
 		once i like what i've heard of the new album
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		his uh
 	
 	
 		i like his old stuff
 	
 	
 		uh like what
 	
 	
 		um Purple Rain
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i have that tape um
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's very good have you heard uh Dirty Mind
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum-um i don't think so
 	
 	
 		oh that's a that's a fantastic album it's even
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		earlier it's one of those where he's playing all the instruments and it's uh actually pretty brilliant a lot of it's uh like the dirty side of his stuff
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but that's all right too
 	
 	
 		yeah he's always been kind of a pervert
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which is weird because it's like on one hand he's so religious and then on the other hand he's such a big pervert you know kind of ironic
 	
 	
 		right well
 		yeah well i think that kind of happens for
 		a lot of artists i mean you could say the same sort of thing about
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis or something or well Jimmy Swaggert he's in  he's a singer
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum that's true
 		um-hum
 		they abuse their power
 	
 	
 		uh right uh and no it seems that a lot of people a lot of Christians seem to sort of walk the line between uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know total depravity and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and religion and asceticism you know
