 
     		
 	
 		okay for as far as um i would think the probably the uh worst substance that's probably um or started to say the uh what causes the most air pollution is probably the car
 	
 	
 		
 
 		probably so
 	
 	
 		and uh whether or not um they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed uh train  or or something like that or park
 	
 	
 		yeah it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility
 	
 	
 		yeah that's exactly it and that's what we're finding um here where we're at in Minneapolis area is that people don't want to carpool that there are
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		inconveniences to that or maybe you don't like the person you have to you would want to carpool with that kind of thing so it's it's kind of a thing where uh i think the majority of the people do not carpool
 	
 	
 		i think so too i'm in Texas and very few people carpool uh the people that i know don't want to because uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon you know they just feel they need their car
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		uh-huh or if somebody gets sick yeah or if somebody gets sick and it's not the other person and they want to go home and that one person's got the car then they're they're stuck you're definitely right so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum that's right and people don't want to give it up but now i think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 		sure  oops sure that happens quite a bit
 	
 	
 		to change the car itself but uh you know i i don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent but yeah
 	
 	
 		yes yeah that's very true um other than that uh i don't know oh okay oh okay we'll try to be real quick here the other thing then is because i don't know how long they want us to talk it
 	
 	
 		well my other line is ringing but we're going to ignore it  i'm sorry for these beeps
 		oh a close to five minutes i believe and you're in Minneapolis well is the pollution really bad up there
 	
 	
 		five minutes oh okay Minneapolis area
 		uh actually no we have uh quite a bit uh the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season you get more pollutants such as those but those are natural
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um but there is starting to in Minneapolis itself because of so many people on the highway there is becoming a problem of pollution and they just put in a strict
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any uh lead
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		into the air the air or other pollutants and if that's the case then you have to get your car fixed at least you can't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's the way it has gotten here we have just had that law i think about a year maybe a year and a half here in Texas
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that and uh but if they are polluting the air they need do need to have them fixed
 	
 	
 		yeah it's not a bad idea
 		um-hum
 		sure sure
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and you know there's a big move especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the CFCs that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh they can't use like i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of Freon that they use in the air conditioning systems systems
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		therefore the individual every time they have a service call if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty two Freon or whatever it is it costs them three times as much to get it fixed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and uh if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of Freons that do not release as many CFCs into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so eventually people are gonna have to go to newer systems you know but
 	
 	
 		sure uh the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars uh air conditioning i'm sure over there it's it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it but it's uncomfortable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh this year my husband recharged our freon because it was needed to be done and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		into the air because he opened it and i don't know if there was something wrong with it or it his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that and i was thinking how many other people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it's probably happened to millions of people um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh sure because if you take it into a service station they want to charge you forty dollars just for uh freon which only costs you about three dollars so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say hey that's that's right there i think it's like three or four dollars a a can
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car and i i thought about that and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i'm sure he breathed it
 	
 	
 		inhaled so much of it um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh you think about that all the people that are using freon and things like that and
 	
 	
 		yeah well of course in the uh i'd think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		exactly
 		pump yeah
