 
     		
 	
 		this is an easy easy subject i i guess i watch too much TV that's
 	
 	
 		yeah i i watch a lot of television myself here lately i'm out of a job right now so
 		watch a lot of lot of Jeopardy and cartoons
 	
 	
 		do you afternoon shows mainly then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah my kids love to watch cartoons and i have to come in the other bedroom to watch Jeopardy and and  such what are some of your favorite sitcoms or whatever at night
 	
 	
 		um i like uh the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty good
 	
 	
 		and uh generally the the channel eight stuff that comes on Doogie Howser and Roseanne and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you don't have a real favorite or
 	
 	
 		a real favorite
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		probably Fresh Prince or Married With Children
 	
 	
 		they're your favorites huh they're pretty good oh it surprises me that yours aren't the same as mine and i thought i formed mine kind of with my husband so we've been MacGyver fans forever
 		and i don't know if you ever watch that  it's on Monday nights
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh excuse me
 	
 	
 		we
 		we enjoy it mainly because it i think it has it's full of adventure and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i i watch that when i can usually i i go out right around then so i'm not home then
 	
 	
 		yeah and  we used to like Cosby real well but it it's kind of slacked off a little bit it's not one of our
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Murphy Brown is always is good for several laughs we like that we watch Doogie quite often too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but the last couple we wondered if the kids should watch with and tonight's or tomorrow night's sound pretty bad too so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh we we watch and LA Law is another one we probably watch if we can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and Quantum Leap we have our our favorites of course i don't know what channel they're all on probably different ones
 		that's kind of fun to watch too  are you watching the World Series right now too or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh yes i am actually i it's the first year i've really been interested interested in baseball but i just  decided to pay attention here to the the World Series
 	
 	
 		i have a brother that lives in Minnesota so this kind of  been fun to watch and
 		they tried to get get tickets and man the scalpers that were out wanted a hundred and fifty per ticket
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's getting tickets for something like that it's like trying to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know enter Fort Knox
 	
 	
 		yeah so i just read in today's paper where the Dynasty sequel um out rated the World Series that really surprised me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's kind of strange
 	
 	
 		i didn't think i didn't care to watch that Dynasty at all i guess it depends on if you're a Dynasty fan or not
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah and now and now Dynasty is again tonight and the World Series is back on again tonight
 	
 	
 		it will be interesting to see how many keep with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see if it was really that good or not but
 	
 	
 		i think what it is is everybody
 		excuse me everybody was looking to see the the fight between the the two women
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah they look like that's pretty good
 	
 	
 		that's a a friend of mine was taping it just so he could see this one fight and he taped the wrong day because it wasn't on the first day
 	
 	
 		oh gee oh well
 	
 	
 		so now he's got to tape tape it again today i think's when it comes back on
 	
 	
 		i think i'll stick with the World Series  let them fight it out i don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i never was much of a Dynasty fan
 	
 	
 		no i i watched Dallas at first when it first came on and then i lost interest in it too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and Dynasty i just never did get into so but well i think that's all we need to discuss we have a few similar not too many and
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		now i'll have to watch one of yours and see if i like it so all right it was good talking to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay
 		thank you bye
