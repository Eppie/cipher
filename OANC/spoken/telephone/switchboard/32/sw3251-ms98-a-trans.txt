 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay and uh i i missed a part of it we're to talk about what lawns and gardens
 	
 	
 		lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do i'm i'm a putterer i chose that topic because i really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		i well it's it's it's very  strange strange that i got this call because my wife just called me i was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you know mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall fall bulbs
 	
 	
 		um-hum we've had a late fall it seems like the weather in fact today it's really warm and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up but you know you need to pretty soon
 	
 	
 		uh
 		right that's the way this was the the petunias were really great our mums are are beautiful
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know if we i don't think we've had a frost up here i've been i was down New Orleans for a week so i don't know what happened last week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but uh it seems like it's
 		oh i don't know if it's late i'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer so i can get a lot of stuff down out here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i i enjoy it we came here we just moved into this well we moved in November and put all all the landscaping in this this year we came from nine years in a condo
 		uh and working in that condo you didn't have to do anything you know unless you really wanted to so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so now you have the chance to really create and and spread out
 	
 	
 		right you know i've had this is my
 		third third house i think i've owned
 		um but uh it's interesting the only the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling and it sort of gets away from me if you're not with it so but uh i i enjoy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		most of it and about this time of year there is it starts getting a little old and i start looking forward to you know having other things to do with my
 	
 	
 		the grass not growing so fast
 	
 	
 		ah well it is it is for me because i've been doing a lot of fertilizing we had a terrible summer we had a drought
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing and now it's really growing and i'm trying to establish a good root root growth you know for the winter
 	
 	
 		hm ours seems to have slowed down here we're not having to mow every week religiously
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		but we're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the the summer flowers out i still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh really um yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but like today it's eighty five degrees it's really strange
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i hear that from my brother-in-law lives in Plano
 	
 	
 		but that'll change real quick  then we'll wished we'd planted bulbs and pansies already
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well he always
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here and then he calls us yeah it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine so
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		well Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot
 	
 	
 		oh i yeah
 	
 	
 		and we have ice storms every year and there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that is i was you know i was like conditioned to it they're they're have to be hardened to it already yeah that's uh that's strange with me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know you think
 		Dallas you know almost semitropical you wouldn't have that kind of that kind of problem but
 	
 	
 		well for the most part we don't but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold well the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but the the ice storms really are stressful on all the the plants that we have around we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to
 	
 	
 		really oh do they
 	
 	
 		and uh pittosporum that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time you you really take a chance with them freezing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i love
 		yeah i love the uh the landscaping like i say my brother-in-law lives in Plano and i get to Carrollton quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i go there on on business and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens and
 		Texas is Dallas Dallas is very nice i really enjoy it there the landscaping the homes the architecture the whole thing very enjoyable gardens and my wife and i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		except for the lack of trees out where we are  it was all cotton fields and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah that we have you know Ohio's a a very pretty state we moved in seventy six we moved to Chicago we lived there for five years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt uh we were coming in and before the plane landed she looked out the window and she said she said Randy there's no trees down there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i said there are this is Illinois you know and when we got out to the area where we decided decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and now all of a sudden it was being developed and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees
