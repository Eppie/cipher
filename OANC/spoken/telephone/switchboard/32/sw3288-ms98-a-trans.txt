 
     		
 	
 		hi so uh what was the last car repair you had
 	
 	
 		
 
 		just recently i was kind of laughing when i when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because uh i had to have my uh radiator flushed
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it was getting rusty and the thing that they forgot to do was to um to also look at the hose
 		and i had gone about oh two days with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst so i was stranded out on the highway
 	
 	
 		oh no did you crack the block or what
 	
 	
 		no i i i didn't do that thank goodness but um there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there you know left to do that but it cost me all kind of money you know to have that repaired after they said they were gonna they had repaired it t
 		so that was that was a horrible experience just recently
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll see you got lucky didn't ruin the whole engine though that can be pretty serious
 	
 	
 		yes yes i know i know what about you
 	
 	
 		oh i guess it's been awhile for me i'd say it's been about a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i had the uh the water pump break on my car
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah i was traveling uh i was going on my way home from Thanksgiving and it broke like in the middle of nowhere
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i had to get it towed and then fixed and big pain
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh oh i know i know especially what if you're out on the highway
 	
 	
 		yeah that's where i was luckily someone came by and gave me a ride
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum i know well you know i uh living in Dallas you know we've got uh bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic and uh that was that was horrible
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know to have the you know your car is fuming and everything it's already a hundred degrees you don't need that too oh shoot
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but my car is getting old see it's about six years old now so
 	
 	
 		yeah so is mine
 	
 	
 		yeah so i got it right out of college and so it's uh it's starting to show that wear and tear now
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm hoping mine gets me through i got until May till i'm out so if my car lasts that long i'll be okay
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh yeah that uh that was my graduation present to myself so yeah yeah i know so but gosh it's really starting to to wear so i've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		gonna because i can't uh i don't know if i wanna you know pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't wanna do too much on mine because it'll be worth more than the car and that it it's not worth it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum yeah that's true i agree with you there so i don't know uh because i i need to have it tuned you know tuned up and i don't know replace some of the belts and i was looking at the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		tires need to be replaced and so i was thinking gee that's a lot of money i'm might as well buy me a new car for that
 	
 	
 		yeah i got new tires last winter too so i'm like that's the last major purchase for this thing it's not worth it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you have to  Pennsylvania boy you have to really have your car winterized and stuff huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we get some killer winters up here in the mountains
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh really oh okay so
 	
 	
 		yeah lot of snow and a lot of cold
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well especially don't you have what a lot of salt on the ground
 	
 	
 		yeah at times there's a lot of it you got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah well rust and the and the body too huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't had a big problem with that though
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i've been pretty lucky there
 	
 	
 		well i think they got the new Z Bart stuff and everything to where you can um
 	
 	
 		yeah that's for usually pretty good you just rinse it off after the winter's over and done with it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah and go like that so
 	
 	
 		yeah i usually like to do most repairs on my own though
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yeah just because that way i know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah plus if something goes wrong i'll know who to blame
 	
 	
 		well i i think i'm getting too old for all that my uh i had four brothers and they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff so i can i can do all that stuff but i i think i'd much prefer to pay the twenty two ninety five to to go and have it done now so i can get my hands dirty
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so yeah i'm just getting getting to that age i guess you just don't have your time becomes very precious so working on the car is just not one of those things i wanna spend my time on anymore
 	
 	
 		more fun things to do
 	
 	
 		absolutely absolutely so yeah trying to you know i just need one i had two cars there for a while so i wouldn't have to worry about which car was gonna run
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's nice
 	
 	
 		and yeah so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them and yeah so that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		one's bad enough
 	
 	
 		yes one was bad enough but i think i got rid of the wrong one  i soon i need a lot of repairs done on on this one so yeah that was uh that was something else
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		whenever our five minutes up  i i didn't i didn't set the time or anything to uh yeah put
 	
 	
 		yeah i was just wondering that
 		yeah i didn't either
 		yeah this must be a a hard category
 	
 	
 		well yeah i guess um you know unless you're um you know big do-it-yourselfer um to you know fix up your own cars and
 		and things like that so but i guess they they were talking about experiences you know i uh uh i did my parents live in Ohio so i i do know something about the you know the really cold weather
 		and uh i've always lived down here in the South and i went i took my car up there to their house and um i guess i had a crack in the block and when i got up there the car
