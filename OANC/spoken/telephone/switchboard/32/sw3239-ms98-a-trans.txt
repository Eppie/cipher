 
     		
 	
 		well do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		yes i do i have a dog named Grisly who's a ten year old uh mixed breed between Golden Retriever Afghan Hound and Chow and i have a pair of box turtles
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh i used to have box turtles um well years ago when i was growing up i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i really liked them um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i do too
 		Lucky and Spot that's their names and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle and always has his nose all around my turtle box
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so do you have any pets now
 	
 	
 		yes um we have one dog a Bichon Frise um
 		our friends in Houston bred the dogs i had never heard of them
 	
 	
 		no i haven't either
 	
 	
 		they're um they're all white and they're small and um and fluffy they don't shed i guess they are distantly related to a poodle but
 		they're not very well known in this country and they're not um high strung or over bred
 	
 	
 		oh and how big do they get
 	
 	
 		um
 		ours is uh on the small end and she's about ten pounds and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		and they love people um
 		and kids and that was something we were looking for um
 		our our love is Golden Retrievers and
 		that's what we had intended to get in Houston but we had a small yard and a pool and knowing how they love to dig and love the water um and we thought that was kind of a tough climate
 	
 	
 		yes the water yes
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh we ended up getting this and uh my son would rather have a Golden Retriever though i think  now he wants a
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		a good size dog
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well we've got a good size dog and we were considering getting a puppy a small house lap top dog
 		for him because he likes other animals and for me because we used to have a miniature Dachshund and i miss having a little one
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know around the kind you have sounds very interesting though
 	
 	
 		what they really are um they're really sweet dogs we've uh we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of um
 		the family that had them and and bred them they had five litters of puppies and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood because um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		and how do you spell that breed
 	
 	
 		they
 		it's B I C H O N F R I S E
 	
 	
 		F R I S E and how do you pronounce that
 	
 	
 		Bichon Frise
 	
 	
 		okay
 		i'm writing it out phonetically
 	
 	
 		yeah they're uh
 		and they don't shed so they're they're good dogs for people with with allergies and they love people i mean they're
 	
 	
 		yes
 		do they bark a lot
 	
 	
 		um no not really ours um
 		ours barks more than uh than
 		some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house we used to swap back and forth dogs that they have three dogs they had a Cockapoo and and two Bichons um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there and and um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		now it's funny she's she's a good watch dog i mean if there's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um she'll bark that way but she also talk a lot she
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um
 		has a definite personality and so if we're leaving her she barks at us because she doesn't want to be left um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		does she ever mess in the house
 	
 	
 		no no and they're um they're very smart dogs the circuses in Europe used to use them um for the acts they uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		oh they'll dance on their hind legs each
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		um  but they're very easy to train and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and about how much are they
 	
 	
 		well they range i'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars i think which i thought was a lot
 	
 	
 		and how about the and how about the person in uh Houston
 	
 	
 		well she's no longer breeding them but um because her dogs um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as um pets you know they weren't weren't show quality
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		just pets
 		yes that's what we'd rather have is just a pet instead of we used to show Saint Bernards when i was a little girl we did that every weekend
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh but yeah it takes a lot of time um
 	
 	
 		yes and it's very expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah um but she might have some contacts here i know originally i know that
 		the dog's grandmother um
 		was from Plano
 	
 	
 		oh that's where i live
 	
 	
 		oh that's where i live too
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm at Coit and Legacy
