 		um i think it's just fine  but um i just worry about some things that show up as drugs that aren't like i've heard poppy seeds come up to be like opium i think they're in the same family
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and just little things like that that um
 		you might get in big trouble for and just because you ate a roll with poppy seeds on it you know
 	
 	
 		right i understand completely you know i i feel the same way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i i believe in drug testing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know there's nothing wrong with that because something like that if you work in some some types of some type of situations that makes it um
 		makes you unmanageable or something like that that you could either hurt yourself or somebody else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i might really agree with it you know if they tell you before you come into employment like when you're going to get hired
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i don't see anything wrong with them telling you that you might have to go through one and and then
 		sometimes i have a hard time understanding the random
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know the i'll pick you out and i'll pick you out and i'll pick you out
 	
 	
 		well random
 	
 	
 		and you go through the drug test
 	
 	
 		random i heard was to make it fair so they wouldn't think you're just picking on somebody
 	
 	
 		what's that now
 	
 	
 		i've just heard that the random testing like drawing a name out of a hat or whatever is just so they can't be accused of you know picking on someone in particular that they're suspicious about you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		but um because i work at a school and they were thinking about doing that
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		were they
 	
 	
 		yeah but even though they were i mean who's to say it's random or not you know
 	
 	
 		right and who's to say if it's for sure
 	
 	
 		they could just
 		uh-huh they could be saying it's random and they could be not random
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah where i
 	
 	
 		you can't prove prove that
 	
 	
 		yeah where i was hired they made us sign something saying that we could be um put through one at any time
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and we were like okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but we did have to sign that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		well i just worry uh you know i don't care so much about well i mean they can they'll get fired whether they do their job or not you know if the drugs affect their job that much but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um i just worry about people that have jobs that could hurt other people like bus drivers and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		stuff like that
 	
 	
 		or air traffic controllers
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly or pilots or
 	
 	
 		right or even somebody on a line you know that could run machinery or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah that's how i feel too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know have you been in Dallas a long time or
 	
 	
 		um-hum about twelve years
 	
 	
 		about twelve years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i just moved here and then South Dakota is very seldom
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		that you see a drug test
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		i think like
 		if you work in defense like i know people have had to have drug tests for that and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but then they have like a secret clearance
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um then i know people that work at um
 		you know normal companies and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		some do and some don't require drug testing you know if it affected the work they might you know wonder but
 		it's not required
 	
 	
 		because i was really surprised because i i go into my major is in accounting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i've looked at an accounting positions
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and definitely a  a position i've applied for has either come up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or you know they won't make you go through one
 	
 	
 		hum even to change position
 	
 	
 		which was a real surprise
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		to change positions
 	
 	
 		no to get a position i just moved here in June
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh from South Dakota and i was real you know shocked to here how many that did
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know from where i'm from it's not
 		that popular or that much i think
 	
 	
 		hum so a lot more here i guess because it's a big big city or
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah you know like Dallas has got more people than the whole state of South Dakota
 	
 	
 		and we're closer to Mexico
 	
 	
 		yes  that's very true
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um you know i guess i never was awakened to it you know i knew it was out there but i knew you know i didn't know it was to a an extent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm glad it's there you know but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was just something that i come across that i wasn't really you know used to
 		but you know i i feel fine with it you know that's not a problem
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum me neither
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		but i'm there's some people that i think there's a cheerleader that's suing a school for wanting to drug test her and i haven't heard if she's going to win or not but um like a high school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		can high can a high school do that
 	
 	
 		but because
 		hum
 	
 	
 		can a high school do that
 	

 	
 		um i think because it she's in the extracurricular thing cheerleading
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they they said they could but um i think she's going to try and use like the constitution against them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		saying it's an invasion of her privacy or something like that and  and i don't know she might win i'm not sure i haven't heard
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i've never heard of a high school asking a student to do that i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		huh that is that in Dallas or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh the high school that she's from
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um no i think it's out further west maybe California or something um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		huh
