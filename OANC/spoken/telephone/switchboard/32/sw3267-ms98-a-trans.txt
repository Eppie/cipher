 		primarily with our local newspaper and TV
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i listen to the radio but not um
 		not like i did when i was working i am recently  retired to that means i have a lot of time to watch the news on TV how do you gain your news
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i guess the i get the Washington Post and that is  pretty big newspaper and i think that's
 		almost exclusive my exclusively my first of the news though i have the radio on when i go to work i don't think the news
 		usually hits  because i'm not going right on the hour
 	
 	
 		oh i see well that's that is one of the handicaps with both TV and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and radio if you're not available on the hour or half hour then you lose out on an awful lot well what is your newspaper
 		that is the Washington Post is that correct i have read that when we were in that area and it it's a splendid newspaper
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so what more do we need to discuss tonight that seems like a very short one
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right i think that you know we've we've resolved the issue and that's what we were asked to do
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well i can discuss a lot of the news that we have but um i feel that that's not part of our responsibility
 	
 	
 		right
