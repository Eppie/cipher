 
     		
 	
 		okay well um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what kind of music do you like
 	
 	
 		i am i was thinking about it for a long time and i like basically almost every form of music and type of music
 		um i don't have a whole lot of dislikes i um like jazz um especially the blues and uh
 		i like uh a lot of the uh of course the classics um everything back from Bach and and Beethoven and Chopin and um
 		just in general everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i enjoy uh a lot of the the modern forms um uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		still
 	
 	
 		do you like like rock and those kind of things punk even
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 		uh well
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that gets some of the punk
 		um when i was in high school that was uh one of the big things was punk music and uh
 		a lot of it is has a lot to say or some some of it has a lot to say the music does the lyrics do but the the actual
 	
 	
 		i don't think they have a whole lot to say even
 	
 	
 		uh well it
 		it's it's it really expresses
 		some of the opinions of of the people who enjoy the music
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess
 	
 	
 		um but as far as a musical art form i just don't see a whole lot of art to it um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you like rap
 	
 	
 		um some of it um it depends i like uh the rap
 		the two types of rap i like or i enjoy to listen to and one is the the rap that is just funny um and they usually do a lot of satire
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that kind i kind of like some of it is kind of
 	
 	
 		right
 		right the monotonous the monotonous no that's not
 	
 	
 		pointless yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about well i'm better than you and blah blah blah i don't like that i like the funny satire and then some of it is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		urban society it it really does it talks about um race relations and police relations and
 		um that that
 	
 	
 		i guess i don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the
 		funny more satire kind some times um i'm with you though i like classical um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't like to listen to it all the time but um some of the time anyway i like easy listening
 		just kind of
 		you know i guess i don't care much for rock and roll any more i
 		used to like it all right but i don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason um
 		let's see country western uh i'm not quite as big on that some of it's okay um
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's about my opinion of that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's okay um
 	
 	
 		uh some of it kind of
 		falls in the rap category i guess so
 	
 	
 		hm the thing about country western that i don't enjoy is is doesn't seem to be any imagination
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		behind it the one country and western song sounds like
 		every other country and western
 	
 	
 		a lot of them sound uh really similar yeah
 	
 	
 		and so the the musicians
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		don't get to really get into their music they just play a certain number of chords the drummer plays a certain beat and you have a country and western song
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		well that's kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes too i guess they don't really
 		has kind of the same sound over and over and the other thing i don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		which
 		probably is just as well on some of them too
 	
 	
 		yeah and i can't say that i like a lot of the modern the very very modern
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh rock and roll but i i definitely i really enjoy
 		the fifties the sixties and a lot some of the seventies
 	
 	
 		yeah earlier things
 	
 	
 		rock and roll
 		and uh
 		i really enjoy especially the sixties uh every
