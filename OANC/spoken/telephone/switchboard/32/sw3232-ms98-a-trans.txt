 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay i guess our topic is um advice about going to college do you have children of your own
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh no i don't have any children but i'm still going to college uh-huh NC State
 	
 	
 		oh are you what school are you going to
 		oh are you enjoying it
 	
 	
 		um well it's a lot of work
 	
 	
 		are you working on your um
 	
 	
 		my Bachelor's uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Bachelor's degree and what field of study are you in
 	
 	
 		um it's actually in computer science and i have a special interest in Voice IO
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh well that's neat are you from North Carolina
 	
 	
 		no i'm actually from Amarillo Texas originally
 	
 	
 		oh are you really oh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well what took you to North Carolina
 	
 	
 		um the service
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that was one of the things i was thinking about in school um when i went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i had a friend my roommate went to Tech also but she was from New Mexico
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she had to pay out of state tuition  and i think that would have uh played a real big part in my decision
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		it would have played a major part in mine
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah because um she was paying of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now it was like four dollars a semester hour
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i was going to  school for you know just a few hundred dollars a semester and she was paying forty dollars an hour  so she's paying ten times as much because she was out of state
 	
 	
 		golly
 		yeah luckily i've paid in state tuition the whole time
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 		yeah so i think  that would be one thing i would definitely consider  try to find a school within the state that um i liked well enough to attend
 	
 	
 		um-hum um
 		uh-huh
 		the second thing is some colleges only offer the uh Liberal Arts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh whereas like State they offer engineering courses
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		so depending on what your major is or medical you might want to atteck somewhere um attend somewhere like Tech
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		and um aside from the uh well some schools may even give you financial aid where another one won't
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's true that was something else i had was i had government aid of course but uh it was wonderful because i got one of those grants that you don't have to repay
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and yeah it was so nice it paid most of my tuition and um a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing so  yeah i really
 	
 	
 		hm
 		wow that's great was it a Pell grant
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry what did you say
 	
 	
 		what kind of grant was it
 	
 	
 		well it was called a BEOG a Basic Equal Opportunity Grant and it was from the government and it was based at first it was based on my parents' income  my parents had five children and really didn't make enough money to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		send any of us to school and so uh because based on the number of children and the amount of money uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my father brought in i got a small grant but then after that i was on my own working and you know trying to go to school on my own
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so then i got a real big grant because the amount of money i was making really didn't compare
 	
 	
 		wow
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it was kind of nice i don't know if those are still available or not but
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i'm not quite there's there's a lot of different organizations who uh who do give grants but uh
 		i'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how how much that they you know they generally run
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah  well this was great it was just based on you know how much your tuition  costs and everything and generally it paid everything so i went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing so that was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		golly that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah it was really nice
 	
 	
 		oh another thing i've got a i've got a degree from another college and uh something that might play a part is the size of the college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh lots the smaller schools can give you a lot uh a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they just give you a  teacher's assistants you know instead of a scholar you get a TA
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh you don't get near the uh quality of education  and as well the uh smaller schools often times don't cost as much
 	
 	
 		hm i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well  i guess the only comparison i had ever heard was between um
 		a Christian college because i  thought about attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and of course the price was just astronomical compared to Tech um the Christian college was so much more expensive
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but i guess some of the other colleges smaller colleges might might be a lot different
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh i at State i think it's just a waste of somebody's money to go there
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		it's really a shame because of you know the instruction um i'd rather go to any other college you know in the state and i would definitely get my money's worth uh much better than State
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah huh
 	
 	
 		it's kind of unfortunate because they've they've just grown so big that they just don't care about the students anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you're just a number
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're bent on uh seeing how much land how much more land they can get and how much uh how much of the campus they can build up
 	
 	
 		um
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah it's really a bad situation here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		oh that's a shame
 		well i i felt a little cheated at Tech also once i got into my i um major ed in
