 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm ready okay
 	
 	
 		you have an opinion about civil stuff
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well you know when to me when you're talking about juries there's there's two types of juries you've got the civil juries and then you've got the criminal juries now the criminal juries
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		my understanding of those where a person has done some crime and you're trying to determine that they need to go to jail or not and then if he does for how long the civil jury does it matter of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you owe me some money or you think that i owe you some money and we can't get it resolved so we go to the jury and we're ask we're gonna ask that jury to uh make a decision as to who owes who and for how much
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i'm sorry i have a problem with that
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 	
 	
 		because first of all  i'm a working person and i need to get paid for my day of work and if the our juries only pay us seven dollars and fifty cents for a full day of work
 		i think it's wrong that two people have a dispute they had a little car wreck and maybe one owes the other guy five hundred dollars or a thousand dollars whatnot and they're going to call me away from work
 		for seven dollars and fifty cents to make a decision as to who owes who and how much to me that is what we pay our judges to do
 	
 	
 		okay you're
 		you're you're self-employed so you're not
 	
 	
 		i am self-employed that's right
 	
 	
 		reimbursed by anyone
 	
 	
 		i'm not going to be reimbursed by no one
 	
 	
 		okay uh yeah that that's interesting point i i i'm not an enthusiast for juries particularly
 		and i think especially in in civil cases i doubt doubt the effectiveness of it i hadn't thought about it from terms of the cost point of view to providing the jury
 		i think
 		we may be the only major country today that still uses juries in civil trials
 	
 	
 		you know that one i've never heard of but that you may be right i was i wish i'd you know i've i've never heard that before
 	
 	
 		i'm pretty sure Britain has has uh given up juries in civil cases
 	
 	
 		but i mean isn't isn't that what we have the elected officials who supposedly is unbiased who can't aren't they supposed to have a head on their shoulders to make these decisions
 	
 	
 		well probably judges
 		would be the people you  decision about whether to use juries or decision
 	
 	
 		no decision as to whether or not as far as civil's concerned
 	
 	
 		i mean i i i think
 		it would be better to have them have judges trained professionals deciding such things
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		um i don't know there's any Constitutional way to do that other than to change the Constitution
 	
 	
 		you're probably right but it that's still my as far as i'm concerned i just think it's wrong to use a jury for the civil matters now you can talk about criminal matters
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i've got no problem with that one because you know here you're talking about uh
 		has a person fit into society has he followed the rules of society
 		i've i've got no problem at all with using your peers quote quote
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and helping to make decisions although we'd have problems as to who qualifies to be on that uh jury and i think some of the the
 		manipulative rules that they use to say that all the rich and famous cannot be on a jury but all the poor dregs can be you know it doesn't it doesn't make sense
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		no i don't think i guess different states have different rules on that
 	
 	
 		well it it it what amount to if you're if you're rich if you got money
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		and your really high on society somehow another you're going come up with a one of these excuse that the the the judge gonna say yeah you're excused you don't have to be here
 		but if you are some poor old uh blue collar worker who you know uh just trying to eke out a living and uh i work from eight to five and
 		you know for some reason he's not gonna find an excuse to get out
 		and so we typically find our juries made up of some of the dumbest people rather than the smarter people
 	
 	
 		
 
 		this is because because of  not who initially comes in but who's selected out of the panel uh okay certainly both sides
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		pick criteria by which
 		they wanna wanna judge juries and and uh veto lots of those and i suspect
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that uh well see  likely to get off that way although it it'll vary
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		um
 		i mean i guess traditionally juries are supposed to do findings of fact as opposed to findings of law
 		and deciding
 	
 	
 		but then they but then they also have to make the decision as to how long that person should serve
 	
 	
 		well that that varies by state and locality as to whether the
 	
 	
 		okay and and there most juries don't even know what the hell they even talking about
 	
 	
 		uh there is a little basis for comparison
 	
 	
 		and then when you get someone who says okay this person should be convicted for thirty years two years later they're on probation
 		because the jury doesn't know and in in the state of Texas i don't think you are allowed uh the jury's not allowed to be told how soon that person would be off on probation
 		only thing that they can do is determine how long they should be put in jail
 		not knowing what the rest of the rule is which i think is unfair
 	
 	
 		well i guess i feel much more comfortable with with judges either
