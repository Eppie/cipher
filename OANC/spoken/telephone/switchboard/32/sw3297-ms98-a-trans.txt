 
     		
 	
 		credit cards is one of my  wonderful topics um do you have quite a few or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		i got rid of mine about uh oh it's been about four years ago now
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh went on a strictly cash basis
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh sometimes it's inconvenient but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it is so much better for me
 	
 	
 		it is
 	
 	
 		because i
 		i am the type that will always find an emergency
 	
 	
 		oh me too
 	
 	
 		but i have found that there were so many things that with a credit card you know i really did need
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and with cash once you know it took me probably two years to get on a cash basis when i stopped charging
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but once once i did you know it it only takes me two or three months to be able to save up what i want to buy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm not paying the high interest rates
 	
 	
 		that's what kills you on those credit cards
 	
 	
 		because it's so easy you know you have these wonderful intentions of well i'll just pay off the whole balance and then i won't owe any
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then something comes up you know and well i'll just pay the minimum well you just do that forever
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh and and with the interest charge on the credit cards you're not getting anywhere because you're paying your interest every month and that's all you're doing
 	
 	
 		no you're paying interest
 	
 	
 		and with our Visa that's really high interest we're in the process of transferring from one account to another to get the lower interest on one of the cards
 		so that somehow we can get ahead on that
 		but
 	
 	
 		you know i've i've thought about going ahead and getting something like American Express where you have to pay within thirty days
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes pay the balance at the end of the month um-hum
 	
 	
 		right and just for ID purposes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it's become such a way of life
 	
 	
 		oh it has
 	
 	
 		and
 		like i say it was so convenient
 		and then pretty soon you get a consolidation loan
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to consolidate all your credit cards and then they send you another credit card
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		they i know like you paid that one off now here's another when really you're paying a loan for the other one
 	
 	
 		uh right
 		so i i just finally figured out that for my way of life i did much better and i've
 		i've been able to buy as much or more
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		by just going cash and like i say it was tough because it's a really it's a habit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it is because you think oh i'll get this and just pay it off later
 	
 	
 		or you know you'll think okay i've got x amounts to spend this month and then somebody has a birthday or get they get married or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you think well i'll just put this one thing on it well you don't do that once you start you know you're going to have a bill coming in anyway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no
 		um-hum
 		might as well just yeah like you said there's a lot of things that i could probably do without that i don't do without because i have the credit card
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and uh
 	
 	
 		and i i just you know for for me it was a trap that was too easy for me to get into
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah uh my husband and i just moved from South Dakota to um Plano Texas and uh that was the thing that helped helped us get down here
 		and that's what we're trying to get down on that because the credit card helped us move because we had just graduated from college and we felt that there was a lot of more opportunity down here and so it helped us out with the moving expenses
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um now we're in the process of trying to get that down too but it it did help in that kind of a situation
 		but um
 	
 	
 		well you know there are times when
 		you know it is but i i've been
 		laid off twice in the last four years and had i had a lot of credit cards
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		you're you're stuck
 	
 	
 		i would well you know it it really helped that i didn't have that to pay for but in the other vein had i had them i would have lived on them
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 		yeah because you didn't have any other income
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and uh this way you know i i made do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		when i was you know employed then i didn't have all that that i had to go back and say well i've got ten thousand dollars worth of credit cards to pay off now
 	
 	
 		right and that that's good that's a good feeling not to know
 	
 	
 		it really you know with the first like i say it took me over two years to pay mine off but the first time you know that i could go out and make a major purchase
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		and pay cash
 	
 	
 		and pay cash
 		it was a real good feeling
 	
 	
 		i bet
