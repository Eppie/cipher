 
     		
 	
 		okay well uh what what do you all do for camping
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we don't do so much now but when uh i i was uh a child we went regular old camping tents and and everything like that and then with our children we did uh we had a pop-up tent camper
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we used that to go camping
 	
 	
 		where do you go
 	
 	
 		we uh years ago we lived in Oklahoma and we went to uh Lake Ardmore i mean Lake Murray all the time but when we did it with our children we lived in uh Tennessee and we went up into the Smokeys
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		which was just absolutely fantastic
 	
 	
 		oh i bet it was around Gatlinburg or somewhere out in there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and along the uh
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		there's a ridge that goes down from Tennessee through uh Georgia and into Alabama and uh i think it was called the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh White Cloud or White Mountain and went up on it
 	
 	
 		well now did you all sleep in sleeping bags and did it get real cold at night or
 	
 	
 		it got real cold but the uh camper had uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		beds in it you know when we had that one and uh so we just you know we had our bedding we didn't have to go with sleeping bags but the  when i was a
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh teenager and growing up that was sleeping bags and joining blankets and sleeping on ledges or you know ground and uh that got kind of rough sometimes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		well we only did that once now since we've been married we just go um we go real often to Colorado to the mountains but we'll stay in cabins
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know we call it going camping but we're really not  but the one time that i did go camping when i was about i guess sixteen or seventeen with my family we drove
 		to uh up by Cosa Cosa Springs Colorado and went about seventeen miles back in the back where you couldn't even get a forest ranger if you tried and to the the tent for a week
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and at night it was so cold you thought you'd never feel your feet again and the smell and the stars were just five feet above you you know they were just right there and it was the most
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh just beautiful
 	
 	
 		bonding most wonderful time we enjoyed it but about the fourth day i thought if i don't get a hot tub and shave my legs i'm gonna die  and i had
 	
 	
 		yes  yes i understand that
 	
 	
 		i i i got enough of it right then so when we can go to a cabin as long as we've got running water  i'm a little bit better off
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah my husband and i he he says his idea now of roughing it is the Regency Hyatt and i i agree with him our children are are grown but i know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the TV
 	
 	
 		i understand i agree with him too
 		well that's true um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the phone and we got just strictly by ourselves we uh some of the time we would not allow them to take friends along so that it was just the four of us and you know and we could you know get back in touch with each other
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that that's  and they can't believe that they could survive it and then once they're there they they think it's kind of cool
 	
 	
 		oh i know i know oh they just you know they just thoroughly enjoy it you know or enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and we hiked we would hike all day and  mom did the whole uh pork and beans and you know the slice slice the potatoes and fry them outside and all of the little stuff that we just were so amazed she knew how to do you know couldn't believe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes yes
 		yes like i know that you know breakfast we would you know we'd have these big breakfast cooked over this little Coleman stove and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah with bacon oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yes and would just absolutely taste wonderful
 	
 	
 		and and daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast so we usually had a bite apiece  one one
 	
 	
 		yes  or one yes yes but i know that we you know as a teenager growing up and going to Lake Murray
 		there would be oh maybe twenty twenty five of us because it would be all of my mother's family you know and all my cousins and it
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 		well now is that hot camping is that where you're you're hot like on a beach i mean is that
 	
 	
 		oh no no we were in the we were in the woods you know
 	
 	
 		because a lot of our friends will
 		well a lot of our friends in east Texas will go to east Texas in the summer and camp and i'm thinking how could you stand it you know just
 	
 	
 		well we didn't notice it back then but that was back before air-conditioning was so prevalent you know prevalent and all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah that's true we did a lot
 	
 	
 		and uh you know and it it always rained on us i don't care what weekend we went and when it was it always rained on us
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but i like that and see especially in the tent every afternoon it would rain and you'd get your book and just kind of cuddle up and i thought that was fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		cuddle up um-hum well i don't know i remember one time uh some cousins were in a tent and it was married cousins and they they had the tent and this you know  frog strangler that we used to call him came through and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they were had put their tent over kind of i don't know what it wasn't a creek bed it was like kind of like a little
 		little uh gully or trench or something and the water rushed down and they said they looked down and there went Bud's boots you know there went several things floating down this water you know we just used to have balls you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh no oh no
 		golly
 	
 	
 		it was it was more fun you know and as i said it just rained every time and then my folks had a cabin at one time at Lake Tenkiller and we went up there but it was never quite the same thing you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well
 		yeah well i yeah i understand that too because some of the places we in fact the the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit it loses it's flavor
 	
 	
 		yes yes it does it really does um
 	
 	
 		so  well i've i've gotten in the mood to go now  yeah
 	
 	
 		yes yeah even i would kind of like to go and i know if i go home and say oh let's go camping my husband says you're crazy  i enjoyed talking to you too thank you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		i you're crazy  well listen i enjoyed talking with you
 		okay have a good day bye-bye
