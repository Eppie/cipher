 
     		
 	
 		okay basically i can tell you that i like just about every music there is except for uh uh real hard hard rock i really can't get into that but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i go from classical all the way to uh jazz and country and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh soft pop um so i pretty much have a a wide range of um what i like you know just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there isn't any particular music that i enjoy more than just listening to all kinds so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's about it  i can even take the reggae now it's it's pretty neat music that they came out with so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm pretty much the same way but there's like certain types of country western i can't handle that twangy stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure uh-huh sure the the old old stuff that came out i think it was was it oh jeez
 		came out with some of that Hank Williams you talk about twangy yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah  my in-laws listen to the kind of music i hate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah the old old country
 	
 	
 		the old real old yeah but other than that i like pretty much everything and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah that's the way i am too so
 		other than uh as far as instruments so i can go from piano to the saxophone and lately you know with the new music that has come out some of the really good uh music
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they have the saxophone playing and it's so funny because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself  oops are you okay Tina come here honey  oh my daughter just fell come here
