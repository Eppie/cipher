 
     		
 	
 		well this is a subject that you never think you'll be assigned to speak about  one that kind of comes up when you've lost it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		the other  other subjects  um as i was sitting there i thought the weather's been perfect i don't know much to say about it it's uh
 		it's you know for the balloon festival here in Plano it was just gorgeous and are you it couldn't have been better i mean it didn't foul one launch and that's kind of unusual
 	
 	
 		i'm from Plano also
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and it's kind of cold in the mornings so you dress up warm but by  and that's the only thing wrong i can find with it  but
 	
 	
 		right
 		i just got back from Dayton i spent the weekend in Ohio with my family and the trees are changing color there so that as soon as we got out of the cloud cover of course it wasn't sunny like it is here it was real gray
 	
 	
 		oh how fun
 		i miss that yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and i saw all those trees it just really made me
 		realize how much i miss the fall  i don't complain weatherwise though because it was also thirty five degrees there yesterday morning and the high was only fifty and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies
 	
 	
 		i guess you have to take some things and leave some things
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so yeah i'm from Utah area and the you know we have tons of canyons where the leaves change and they're gorgeous you could spend every weekend of the  fall going to a different area
 	
 	
 		yes
 		we did that when we lived up in Michigan we went up to the upper peninsula and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure
 	
 	
 		hm wow
 	
 	
 		and then on leaf weekends it was which is this time of the year it's bumper to bumper traffic people it's whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves because they had to keep watching the road
 	
 	
 		no it's kind of hazardous for driving that's for sure but i can't complain it  i don't know if i've been spoiled i've been thinking it's getting cold sooner than normal we've only lived here a couple years but
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i think it is and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on at the TV news  that they are three weeks ahead of schedule
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		as far as the coldness of the temperatures and uh the first frost everything just happened three weeks early this year
 	
 	
 		we'll have to see how it goes  a couple weeks ago we were cooler than normal but then we were back to being warmer than normal this week or last week so
 	
 	
 		just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms in the spring i
 	
 	
 		i don't have to live through many any of those really a bad i mean nothing comparable i guess to what you've had before
 	
 	
 		well i've only been here just a short time too so i haven't been through any of those either so i have in Michigan but in in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow and life goes on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you're right
 	
 	
 		so as i understand it here if there's anything they'll call off schools and and close businesses
 	
 	
 		well they get ice and no one can drive on ice i mean we used to think they were pansies but then when you decided what ice was
 	
 	
 		right
 		right the real definition of ice
 	
 	
 		so  well i think we've discussed it good enough today  so it was it was good talking to you maybe we'll get to next time thanks Karen bye bye
 	
 	
 		i think so it was nice talking with you okay okay bye
