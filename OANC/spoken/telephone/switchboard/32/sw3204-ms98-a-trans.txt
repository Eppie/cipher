 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what is it about nursing homes
 	
 	
 		um well about nursing homes and and older people uh my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're just really close here and his mother has bad health too and so i go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and i um help with her and bathe her and feed her
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um and i i it's hard to be a caretaker i really believe it's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty four hours a day
 	
 	
 		oh it's very difficult i know
 	
 	
 		uh it she has Alzheimer's and does not remember
 		uh a lot if anything and so she asks the same questions over and over again
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		which is not unrealistic you know unrealistic um and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeam
 	
 	
 		uh i i some nights his mother calls me and says can your family and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented
 	
 	
 		yeah how old is she
 	
 	
 		she's ninety two
 	
 	
 		uh my see my father is ninety two and still uh he and mother still live at the house and drive and
 	
 	
 		oh well i think that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		and do the whole thing but you know if something would uh whenever something happens to one of them then
 		i don't know what i'll do up there i i just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so
 	
 	
 		well
 		um-hum
 		yeah i was just gonna say
 	
 	
 		they're in Missouri and i could i i know i know stories for sure that they just they they just well they can't take the proper care of them most of them
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it's tragic that you know when people live so long that they uh
 		don't have a place really don't have a place to go
 	
 	
 		yes uh i think it's wonderful these these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can and reside there like little apartment places in between places
 	
 	
 		so
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves um
 	
 	
 		yeah there's one very close to where my parents are but uh
 		i think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't wanna spend the money on anything so uh i mean he's from that old depression era and uh you know it's oh it's just blissful that they're both able to do everything for themselves
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i would imagine that i'll uh if something happens i'll move one of them or both you know in in with me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh but i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and but i think you'd have to really they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		nursing homes
 	
 	
 		on this this homes but i just don't know how much you can see when you go for a i think you just have to drop in all uh unexpectedly a lot
 	
 	
 		visit
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so many people when they put people in a nurses home they never see them
 	
 	
 		they don't go and see them that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		they never go to see them i've talked to many uh
 		owners of places and say that nobody even maybe maybe Christmas
 	
 	
 		you know um i i think nursing homes are
 		our um some are good i have to say that but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 		oh i do too
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		or if  if they could be real real nearby where they could see them everyday or so
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh because i know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes homes uh
 		regulation in Texas so maybe we'll get it improved
 	
 	
 		um-hum i hope so you know it's i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice
 	
 	
 		so  anyway
 		right
 	
 	
 		to have them go there and then if you find out that they are not having good care you know i'm sure that it is just you know you'd pull them out of there so fast
 	
 	
 		oh it's tough i'm sure
 		oh
 		right it'd be devastating i'm sure so
 	
 	
 		and uh and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't  it's a very very hard decision i think
 	
 	
 		it is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought and prior probably
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i think that's right and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		now i know a friend of mine who had a father um she brought to her home
 		um to live there but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to to help him out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that might be a partial solution or something but um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i'd ever
 	
 	
 		i would hope we could do that and then go from there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well anyway
 	
 	
 		well  i i think we kind of are along the same lines
 	
 	
 		we've covered a little bit and uh it's good to hear from you and
 	
 	
 		good to hear from you have a lovely day
 	
 	
 		have a good have a good life
