 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so you said that you live in Coppell
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so what is your house like
 	
 	
 		it's a two bedroom two bath duplex  brick
 	
 	
 		oh well that's neat
 		uh-huh is it one that you're renting or buying oh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		no we own it yeah well our side   uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well that's kind of neat that you can even though it's a duplex you can still buy that's good do you have any children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		no huh-uh do you
 	
 	
 		yes i have two children and our home is really too small for us right now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		ours is too we outgrew it when we moved in
 	
 	
 		yeah we moved from an apartment that was really small and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we moved into this house in Garland it's in one of the older areas of town  and one thing i really like is it has big trees everywhere and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty but the the house is real small it has less than a thousand square feet
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		yeah it's real little
 	
 	
 		y'all are cramped
 	
 	
 		yeah and now i have a daughter now my the one that was five months old is seven years old and the one and i have another one that's three and a half and i have all these clothes and  toys and stuff that we're just trying to find places to put
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 		uh-huh how many bedrooms is it
 	
 	
 		well they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a a built on addition room you know but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		ah
 	
 	
 		so um the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and  you know it's kind of a catchall room
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it sure is nice to have it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when the kids come over to play they all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		how fun
 	
 	
 		yeah that works out good  and i'm thankful i have two girls because they're in bunk beds and so you know they can share a room and uh make for more space that way
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		and how old's the youngest
 	
 	
 		she's three and a half yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um and right now we have their clothes on uh like double racks you know in the closet we made a higher and a lower and it works out fine but they're just about to get too tall  where the dresses are beginning to drag you know and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we're going to have to figure out a new idea but we're we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home and  uh hoping to be able to do that within a year or so so that would be nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		that's what we'd like to do
 	
 	
 		yeah is Coppell a nice area to live
 	
 	
 		oh it's wonderful place to live and they i don't have any kids so i don't really know but they say that we have wonderful schools
 	
 	
 		well i think i've heard a lot uh about Coppell schools that they're real good and that's neat  do you  do you hope to have children or are you not planning on having any or ah i see  well do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum um
 		nah i don't think so nah  oh of course those are my kids i have two dogs
 	
 	
 		uh yeah  ah so do they stay inside or ah well that's neat
 	
 	
 		yeah they're inside dogs they're my babies
 	
 	
 		yeah  well what are the colors in your house
 	
 	
 		uh um kind of a mauve and gray
 	
 	
 		oh i bet that's pretty
 	
 	
 		um-hum and then the kitchen's kind of a a country pink and country blue and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's all done in cows i'm a cow nut
 	
 	
 		oh well that's neat i like cows too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah well our house was redone uh our house is very old also it's like thirty seven years old yeah and it was redone before we moved in which i'm
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		thankful for that but the it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in you know everything is like
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		paneling in the living room and lots of lots of tans and lots of browns but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that you know so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		uh that's worked out good in the in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan um wallpaper and had done it up with blues so that's nice that's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh sounds pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we've enjoyed living here it's it's close to my uh oldest daughter's school and that makes it really handy too
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she really likes her school so and we're so close to shopping and just
 	
 	
 		well good
 		that's an important factor there
 	
 	
 		yeah what uh how about in Coppell i've always imagined it kind of out away from everything
 	
 	
 		well you know now we have that new mall in Lewisville and that's just like a mile or two from our house
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh well that's nice
 	
 	
 		but when we first moved to Coppell it's what six years ago we didn't even have a grocery store
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and now we have four and Coppell's not really big enough to support four four grocery stores
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah yeah but it does sound like it's definitely growing
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh much very much in fact it's about the size now i moved down here from Chicago what twenty three years ago and to Lewisville
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and Coppell's now about the size that Lewisville was when when i moved down here
 	
 	
 		oh i see  well when we first moved here we moved here from Lubbock and we almost moved to Lewisville that was our second choice yeah behind Garland we  at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
