 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child uh trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that and uh i've been pretty selective and what i'm finding is with um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		day cares that are like day care centers like  for instance uh Learning Tree or KinderCare and all of that what i find is that they're highly structured highly organized
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh like nap time or whatever time uh because of parents' hours they are differ and when i bring my daughter into a such a system like that uh
 		they only have one thing going on that's nap time everybody's napping whether they came there an hour before or they came at right during that time and with that kind of a system my daughter
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down on a cot so um home day care has been an option and i've looked into that the only thing is you raise the question of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		is it safe uh can you trust the people you know um
 	
 	
 		that's right  and you never know i have um
 		an ex-sister-in-law that um currently has a child abuse case on a home babysitter
 	
 	
 		sure oh sure sure that's really scary and to the point that you kind of say to yourself especially home day care i mean i think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours it's fine it depends on the age of the child now some children do real well that are at the age of
 		four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while but home teaching  home day care works well if it's an infant if it's
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if it's if you wanna have kind of like a family structuring where there's a home that they can  be provided because i've seen things at the day care where they can't keep up with all the kids the kids have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		colds and they're sick all the time and the
