 
     		
 	
 		real excited when i heard this that's why i've been trying to call all day because i keep getting these subjects like capital punishment so football i love this this is great well we're from Colorado so we're Bronco fans
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		and um we just moved here two years ago and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here and they lost again that was pretty pitiful but they seem to be doing pretty good this year
 	
 	
 		well i was from Illinois originally and i grew up a Bear fan
 		and uh then we moved here even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and we had some wonderful wonderful years there under Roger Staubach
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we kind of got spoiled
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we expected it to continue forever i think they're doing pretty well this year though
 	
 	
 		well they haven't they haven't have they just lost one game this year
 	
 	
 		i think two i know they lost yeah to Washington and Philadelphia
 	
 	
 		two
 		yeah but they're not doing bad people are pretty surprised that they i mean they beat the Giants
 	
 	
 		yeah and wasn't that fun i went went to the balloon festival in Plano and carried my little portable radio with me and i must say i attracted a lot of attention people running up saying oh what's the score what's the score
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		i bet  oh boy i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it
 	
 	
 		that's right and that's exactly what they said my wife dragged me away from the television
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		and now then i wasn't i had forgotten or i probably wouldn't have been there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i am i'm a big football fan i never was my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and i just hated it and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so when i met my husband he was watching football and i figured out that i couldn't see him all weekend i couldn't see him until like Tuesday because Monday Night Football if i didn't like football so
 	
 	
 		that's exactly where both of the wives came from i think it was uh you know it's easier to join them than fight them
 	
 	
 		yep
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if you wanna see them you might just as well enjoy football and i used to tease my husband sometimes and say my gosh you know  did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about these games
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh well i do i just i love it it's such i just think it's such a fun sport and uh i'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet we're not convinced that we're gonna be Cowboy fans yet
 		but uh  well i guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here  that's even harder but
 	
 	
 		well it takes a little brainwashing first
 		yeah are you uh transit usually i mean do you stay not in one place too long
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no we're just this is only the second place we've lived we've only been married for five and a half years and uh we have two small children and he had a uh just got transferred here to E Systems
 	
 	
 		well it'll take you a little while but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for Denver
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		well i tell you this the weather here and there's no mountains or anything you know and when you go to a football game in Colorado it's
 		you know there's snow and it's an adventure  and here you know you just got to drive down to the to the stadium and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 		well if they close it in see we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing but uh Dan Reeves a pretty neat guy anyway
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well he's from here
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right you know he was one of ours one of our boys so we are never we never cheer against Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah  that's what i hear
 		which is rare
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		which is good yeah but uh i you know it's funny in in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last i don't know five or six years whatever it's been um they have these songs on the radio they take modern popular songs and and
 		change them to fit uh the Broncos and stuff and they had i was just thinking about one the other day uh if i saw a picture of John Elway in the in the cafeteria at school um but they did the Johnny Angel they did Johnny Elway to that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		Johnny Elway
 	
 	
 		and i'm uh i was trying to get my son to sing that my husband was just having a fit don't have him sing that song  but they they do a lot of fun things i think football is football's kind of a a sport that i think you kind of it's hard not to like it  do you know there's just
 	
 	
 		well there's so much about it to like you know it's so exciting and when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here course they put together some real cute songs and we all ran out and bought the records and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item
 	
 	
 		it's exciting yeah
 		yeah yeah they probably i i wish i would've bought the tape when i was in uh Texas in Colorado because uh i i think about that a lot but you know when i first moved here was when they well no i guess it was about a year ago they did this
 		this interstate seventy five song or or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety five and everything that was kind of a funny song but they sure do it seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here even when they were losing pitifully
 		you know people still support them we drive by some houses everyday that have big signs we love the Cowboys
