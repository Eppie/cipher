 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		capital punishment
 	
 	
 		all right
 		okay what's your views on it
 	
 	
 		um for myself i'm i'm personally against it but
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		we seem to have a duality of
 		in this country where most states in theory have it but but but do not use it
 	
 	
 		correct okay well i'm for it i think there are certain crimes that definitely uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		call for it i i feel like that child molestation and murder i don't see any sense in
 		someone living that does things like that i i don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way and of course Texas has it but they very seldom
 		you know put it into effect so instead all of our prisons are full of people on you know
 	
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		a lot of people on death row
 	
 	
 		uh Texas uses it as about as much as any other state
 	
 	
 		well uh yeah which is not very often right
 	
 	
 		Texas is a big state
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		here in Maryland to the capital punishment law people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment but no one no one is  has actually has the sentence carried out uh i'd certainly
 	
 	
 		what do they do just keep them on death row for the rest of their life um-hum
 	
 	
 		um-hum i think so  i there there are a lot there or a fair number  uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		in fact i think that it it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available the sentence of life without possibility of parole uh has become a common one
 		and it's being being used much more
 	
 	
 		do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know the exact numbers but but yes prisons are overcrowded
 	
 	
 		i know that we have you know really in fact they're they're releasing people
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh that are in there for you know not major crimes but uh robberies and assault and things like that and because they don't have room which then they're coming back on the streets and of course doing it again
 		and um you know so we're having problems in in that way and i know that there are some cases that uh
 		you know
 		capital punishment does not fit the crime  and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types
 		um but i have to say that i'm honestly for it
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
 	
 	
 		okay you're you're certainly in the majority
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh at least in this country
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh we are i guess the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment
 	
 	
 		i know they use it very um they do not have it in Europe as i understand
 	
 	
 		no at least not in Western Europe probably not in Eastern Europe these days either um
 		there are many reasons for it but they they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates
 	
 	
 		yes you wonder what their you know how they manage to do that
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well in part it's uh it's the nature of societies perhaps more homogeneous society
 		in many cases uh arguably if arguably is because of of uh of uh welfare state benefits though i tend to be we tend to be skeptical
 	
 	
 		well England has uh don't they have a large uh fairly large welfare
 	
 	
 		yes oh there's no question that that they that uh you know they they've you know all kinds of cradle to grave uh programs welfare programs providing for everyone some way i i i however the question is is that making the difference
 	
 	
 		oh i don't i don't know
 		but we have a lot of welfare programs and if both do and they tend to have less crime you wonder if that has anything to do with it then
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know or is it uh in our society
 		people are brought up over here thinking that you know everybody owes them something
 	
 	
 		um
 		i think i think that idea is even even more common in Western Europe
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting i would not have i would not have said that i would have said that it was more prevalent here
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		in the United States
 		that's an interesting theory i'm not that familiar
 		you know i've only been over there a couple of times and i'm not that familiar with uh
 	
 	
 		me too
 	
 	
 		that all i know is that for instance we were in Germany in uh
