 
     		
 	
 		okay as far as uh universal health care um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i guess i'm all for it i think it's time that we start looking at um
 		getting into that um health cost has continued to rise and i think uh there's people that to me it's the fundamental uh life life of a person um
 		it it doesn't matter if you have money or no money or all the money in the world um you would
 	
 	
 		you should still be
 	
 	
 		everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits
 		um i think if uh they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and
 		uh individuals um helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how but uh the expenses right now for health care um are just unreal
 	
 	
 		well they really are even for even when you're not talking about surgery if you're just talking about basic care we've
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		we've got four children and you know in the past month they it just they pass things from one to one and it just can devastate your budget you know um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh sure
 		and your constantly exactly
 		yeah the only i i know that um uh i know a little bit about the uh European uh universal health care and there's some
 		pros and cons one of the things of course is everybody gets health care but uh sometimes health care
 		uh when you get into a universal system lacks in uh what would be considered uh
 		how can i say it um over like in Poland uh where my father-in-law lived for years their their health care system is
 		um because no financial gains are available for doctors
 		uh they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason but most people that go in to being a physician here in the US do it for financial gain
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they say well jeez if i get into this area of dermatology i don't have to do this i can do this and i can you know
 	
 	
 		can still make big bucks
 	
 	
 		yeah or plastic surgery or uh if i become a uh heart specialist i'm gonna make this kind of money uh and there's
 		you know financial gains toward that and in a universal system i don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors
 	
 	
 		do you think that the quality um it would would be as high
 	
 	
 		the quality i think goes down um-hum when you have a universal system um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check um and also offering some kind of because i think uh all physicians well anybody um
 		likes the ability ability to kind of uh get themselves financially uh situated uh i guess that's the whole US concept is to come here and
 	
 	
 		right more motivation
 	
 	
 		yeah and i don't know if you can have that with a universal system maybe you know there's a way of working that out but
 		i know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it that's what they look at it as there's no
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and that's sad because if that's the case if if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway but
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind
 	
 	
 		that's true yeah i uh
 	
 	
 		so
 		but i i think we have to head toward that way
 	
 	
 		well we're going to have to do something because there's just too many people in the country that are uninsured and and you know you cannot i mean it's just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i'm worried when i get older  you know and uh let's say for instance you uh
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		get fired or or not fired but maybe laid off from your job you no longer have insurance
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i mean and you're sixty some or uh fifty some years old you try try to find insurance
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean you're you're uninsurable unless you want to pay five hundred six hundred dollars a month and i know people that are paying two hundred three hundred dollars a month for insurance
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and how they can do it i have no idea um i know working for small corporations and health insurance um myself
 		um it would cost for a family and this was back three four years ago to put my entire family up and this was working for like a medcenter uh health plan
 		um it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck so
 	
 	
 		yeah well ours  ours is three hundred for our family and i mean we that is we pay that instead of a car payment you know i mean i'm driving a piece of junk you know
 	
 	
 		see yeah
 		well we do the same i mean it's i think uh people are changing their viewpoints of you know it's getting harder and harder to survive
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh and that's why uh if they don't go to a universal system something's going to happen we're gonna have uh
 	
 	
 		see
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh larger amount of people dying
