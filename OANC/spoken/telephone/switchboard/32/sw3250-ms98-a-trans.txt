 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		why don't you go ahead and start
 	
 	
 		okay well we subscribe to People magazine and to Time
 		and course i like the People magazine because it's gossipy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's fast reading and uh the Time of course is uh you know more newsworthy and
 		and uh
 		it has more world affair type things of course
 		and then i will purchase a Good Housekeeping occasionally especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and things like that and uh do you subscribe to any magazines
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i well i have in a while for a while i haven't gotten any because i just find that i'm not reading what i'm getting because uh
 		i have so much going on in my life that seems to be the last thing i pick up so i found that i was wasting my money as much as i enjoy them
 		uh when i do subscribe i i've gotten in the past the Parents magazine and uh  the Housekeeping magazine and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh you probably have smaller children younger children my children are our children are grown
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren
 	
 	
 		right well i found that after a couple of years of having a Parents magazine it was getting repetitious so i kind of canceled it anyway for that reason
 		uh the Housekeeping magazines i do like because they like you say they have nice  uh recipes in them and ideas but uh lately they just been piling up on me so i figured it wasn't uh something i needed at this point in time
 	
 	
 		well do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't know i i well my husband would love to have more now he's the type who will get the uh Inc magazine and Money magazine and all the financial type magazines
 	
 	
 		yes now my husband does that and you know and of course uh naturally Wall Street Journal you know and or Sports Illustrated but i don't know i know i see people leafing through them at the store
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you just don't hear people talk about them and i know years ago when uh my children were young and stuff
 		i just loved Ladies' Home Journal McCall's Good Housekeeping and i took them all and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then oh i don't know what in the seventies maybe late seventies they changed their format and i haven't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't think there as good a magazine as they used to be even Good Housekeeping i don't
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah and and some of those that have what what i consider or what i get the idea that they're maybe the
 		the more pricier type magazines as far as women's magazines they seem to be just so chocked full of of ads
 	
 	
 		oh they are my sister uh takes uh
 		Town and Country and Vogue
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she sends them to me and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes very expensive jewelry
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yes
 	
 	
 		things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing
 	
 	
 		right  yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and if i want to drool or if i want to see how the other half is living
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 	
 	
 		you know then i can i look through them and i do i just what i do is i flip through them and and pitch them then you know they're not something i  you know take any length of time over
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i have discovered that you know with my available time i would rather actually read a book than a magazine
 	
 	
 		yes i enjoy books a lot more that's true
 	
 	
 		yes and um so but
 	
 	
 		well yeah i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to other than my children have gotten you know they get tons of magazines it seems they they're always getting something in the mail
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh so between reading to them and uh reading the newspaper and then i have a book that i'm occasionally reading when i get a chance but i just don't get a chance for those
 		uh newsy magazines the ones that are full of ads unless you just want to skim through while you're i i read them when i'm at a doctor's office or you know waiting on something like that
 	
 	
 		yes yes i will read them in a doctor's office too as i said i i subscribe to uh to People and to Time and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i will go through the Time but usually not to cover to cover you know i'll glance through it i'll like reading uh
 		you know the Passage of People or something you know and uh but i do like the People magazine it it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh that's one and you know i really like that i enjoy that it's quick reading
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it doesn't require a lot of thinking and sometimes after i've worked all day and have things to do at night
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just i want fluff  i don't want a lot of thinking
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		that's true that kind of is a good way to do it
 	
 	
 		it uh you know it's it's much more relaxing sometimes when i read Time Time magazine after i've read an article i'm real depressed over the situation of the world
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so well it seems like we both kind of agree on on the subject of magazines
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so uh i think that probably i will end the call i've enjoyed
 	
 	
 		okay
