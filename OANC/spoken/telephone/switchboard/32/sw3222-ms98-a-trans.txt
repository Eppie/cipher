 
     		
 	
 		well i know
 	
 	
 		you like to eat  we're we can even discuss restaurants
 	
 	
 		oh i tell you i thought uh this is a great topic for me because i love to eat out my husband says i'd eat out every meal if i could
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i like well my favorite restaurant in the whole uh Dallas area is uh Siciliano's A Taste of Italy i love Italian food and they have wonderful garlic rolls and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh yeah
 		hm
 	
 	
 		all of their entrees are wonderful have you ever heard of that place
 	
 	
 		where is it
 	
 	
 		there's one on Arapaho right at the intersection of Arapaho and Jupiter and then there's one i live in Garland and it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i was gonna say that
 	
 	
 		yeah there's another one over here real close to my house at Walnut and Shiloh but they've built some more there's one over in the Hurst area of Fort Worth and
 	
 	
 		i know i've seen it somewhere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what is it is it what's it like just good food
 	
 	
 		yeah it is the atmosphere is okay i mean it's kind of dark and has candle lit tables and that kind of thing but it's not a real fancy place you know it's just the food is just really exceptional and they give you real big quantities
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it and all their entrees come with like a salad and soup and all the rolls you can eat and so by the time you get your food you're already full
 	
 	
 		value and taste
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i uh i am not a as much an Italian food fan except for garlic bread and i could eat my weight in garlic bread
 	
 	
 		oh oh well you could go there what i do sometimes for lunch is uh just just get like soup and salad and eat their garlic bread because it's so delicious yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		i would love that i mean but uh you know that's what
 		except for the type of food that's kind of what i like
 	
 	
 		yeah well um what's your favorite place
 	
 	
 		um my i  Mexican restaurant
 	
 	
 		oh you like Mexican i like that too
 	
 	
 		and um and and i work uh downtown and so there are a lot around here um and and in
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh you know like the Knox central you know On the Border i like for one kind of food and then there's the holes in the wall i like for another another type um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh uh but what i look for is cost and yeah well i don't i don't know i don't like noisy restaurants either i that's why i don't go to On the Border that much
 	
 	
 		well that's neat
 		yeah well that's my main thing too
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah yeah that is a real noisy place
 	
 	
 		yep and
 	
 	
 		i've only been there a couple of times but the the times i was there i felt like my head was echoing  when i was trying to talk
 	
 	
 		and
 		i mean it's just i don't know it's a cavern you know it's just because it's so big and tall and and a big room of full of lots of people or or what
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah i know what you're talking about well we have a  a restaurant down here a lot of people won't even eat there but uh we like it it's Pancho's have you ever been there Mexican buffet uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yes the all you can eat buffet my husband goes there for lunch and he just i mean he thinks it's  uh Mexican food Mexican food you know it's
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah oh yeah well they have a chili relleno or chili relleno um-hum
 	
 	
 		really i've heard they're good
 	
 	
 		they're really good and they uh the plates the thing i like about this place is they bring you all the chips and stuff you can eat plus they bring sopapillas as many as you want
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so you know a lot of places you have to order that separately yeah oh it's really nice and the children eat free we have two kids and
 	
 	
 		extras and oh
 	
 	
 		one of them eats free the other one's up above that age but she still gets a you know reduced price yeah so it's a real good deal for a family to go and you can just really get full
 	
 	
 		so it's good yeah
 		that's uh that's what i like cheap and then but i like but do you like to go out or do you eat at McDonald's a lot or stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i like i really prefer to go you know some place where i sit down and someone waits on me  but um my kids of course both love McDonald's and uh McDonald's Burger King anything that's got a place to play
 	
 	
 		or yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i spend time at those places too because i know how much they enjoy we go to Show Biz a lot but do you have children
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i don't but um
 	
 	
 		um Show Biz is the noisiest place you can imagine  because
 	
 	
 		so you've kind of got to go there for playing for the kids and not for you
 	
 	
 		right that's right it they have a wonderful area to play you know they have big balls and games and rides and i mean all kinds of stuff it's like a little bitty amusement park in there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's really fun they have these uh puppets that get up and sing and dance and you know  so it's real entertaining for the kids and the food is good they have real good pizza there um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		good pizza i love pizza but i usually order that pizza is what i usually order you know at the house deliver it to me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right have it at home yeah
 	
 	
 		and anything but Domino's

 		i don't like their politics
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well i've just never cared for for their pizza at all  we have a Little Caesar's down here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's wonderful i've had their food before
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's really good and very um you get a good quality for the money you pay
 	
 	
 		do you we get lots of coupons on our doors and and that's  and i end up ordering from those like Spinners or Winnsers or you know the
 	
 	
 		so
