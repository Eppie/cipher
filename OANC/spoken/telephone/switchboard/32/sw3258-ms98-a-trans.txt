 		so that's kind of nice
 	
 	
 		i've worn them in the winter when it's like ten degrees and you know no one's going to look
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that's see i just moved here from South Dakota
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and now that's a change in wearing clothing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh they just got uh they're down to thirty degrees now
 	
 	
 		already
 	
 	
 		yeah and they've gotten snow and the whole bit so when i was there i would wear everything you know

 		when did you get here
 	
 	
 		June first
 	
 	
 		oh so you got the summer
 	
 	
 		yeah and it wasn't too bad um because there they can have both extremes
 		so we can
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess they that uh
 	
 	
 		it can get really hot
 	
 	
 		it it did not get hot here this summer
 	
 	
 		that's what i was told
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that it was pretty mild  but that's when i moved and i left all my winter clothes with my mom in Nebraska
 	
 	
 		don't don't send for them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay i i just brought a couple and it's like they're still sitting in the closet

 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh you know a lot of dresses
 	
 	
 		yeah i i'd say it's it's uh probably eighty percent dresses
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh once in a while we wear the pants
 		but not too often
 	
 	
 		i just wear
