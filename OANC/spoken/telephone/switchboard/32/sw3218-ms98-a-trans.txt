 
     		
 	
 		do you have a pet
 	
 	
 		yes we have two too many at the moment um
 	
 	
 		what all do you have
 	
 	
 		well we have a um a dog as a golden lab and a um cat and they're both driving us crazy actually they're uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 		lot of work
 	
 	
 		just a just a lot of work and the kids seem to be in so many activities that
 		the reason for having the pets were you know for them and they don't seem to have the time to to care for them so  we're at a frustration point with our pets how about you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i know how that it is because until like a few days ago i had a little Miniature Pinscher
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um my parents finally took him to Miami where they are
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		and um it was kind of a pain because i was taking these classes after work so i couldn't leave my dog locked up you know all day and then all night so i'm glad they took him
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because  otherwise i would have a big mess in my apartment when i'd come home you know
 	
 	
 		that's for sure they're they're a big responsibility they're really fun for especially for the kids  if they have the time to enjoy them but
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		boy uh it's a lot of work it seems
 	
 	
 		um-hum but i'm i'm single so it would keep me company
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		you know there's something you to come home to and happy to see you
 	
 	
 		well i i enjoy mine if my husband's out of town i enjoy having the dog just for you know he'll he'll bark if anyone comes around or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		protection
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that sort of thing so it is a comfort from that standpoint
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do the cat and the dog get along or
 	
 	
 		yeah they do they um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they get along fine but the  cat doesn't get along with anyone in the family she
 		every time you walk by she grabs attacks your leg and just hangs on and we've had cats before we've never had one like this so i i don't know what the deal is with this cat
 	
 	
 		huh
 		did you find it or did you buy it or huh
 	
 	
 		no it was a gift  someone gave it to us  for my daughter's birthday so um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and we you know we had been looking for one so  we were hoping to get one but this this one is
 		kind of  been a problem we live across the street from a vet and he just can't quite figure it out either so
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum it is kind of strange i wonder where they got the the cat from
 	
 	
 		it was um from uh um Wills Point i don't know if you're familiar with
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		the town  you know just outside Dallas and knew somebody that lived in the country so we're wondering if maybe if they were kind of a country outside breed you know um
 	
 	
 		huh
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		maybe they're just a little too wild or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum because that's what i was wondering if you found it or not because it sounded pretty wild
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		huh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		does your  husband hunt with the dog or anything or
 	
 	
 		no no he's not a hunter he he's always liked having big dogs but um  doesn't work real well in the city with small yard
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when we um when we get got the dog we lived out in the country and she could just run and that was fine that that worked real well
 	
 	
 		yep
 		oh how neat
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but now that we're  in the city it's kind of hard yeah
 	
 	
 		hm
 		how long have you been living where you live
 	
 	
 		um we've moved here in January
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so just not quite a year  um you said you're going to school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum yep i i'm just at the Albany Easy Learning Center
 	
 	
 		work
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		i'm just taking education and psychology courses i'm a teacher and i have a bachelor's in psychology so i'm just trying to brush up on stuff  to be a better teacher
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		yeah
 		oh well that's good well i i bet your your kids do you have pets in your classroom or you don't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum-um nope downstairs they have a gerbil and a
 	
 	
 		a what
 	
 	
 		fish i think like a gerbil and a fish but in our particular classroom we don't have anything we have plants
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		seems like our kids have mostly
 		had um guinea pigs and that sort of thing in their classrooms and that's kind of neat you know um the whole class gets to take turns taking it home and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and that so a little visiting pet you can you can uh have the fun of it without the total responsibility
 	
 	
 		um-hum yep
 	
 	
 		but that's worked well
 	
 	
 		can just mess up it's cage  you don't have to worry about your whole apartment
 	
 	
 		right
 		really
 	
 	
 		yep
 		um have you been trying to call in lately and it's been the same topic
 	
 	
 		no um let's see i'm trying to think the last time i called in was probably  um
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		few days ago it was cooking or something
 	
 	
 		it was what
 	
 	
 		cooking yeah
 	
 	
 		really because i've been calling in lately and this is uh my last call that i have to make i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um every single day for probably about a week it was gun control
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		gun control and i was just about to freak out you know because i already talked with someone about gun control
 	
 	
 		
 
 		get tired of gun control huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh you only can talk so much about gun control so hm
 	
 	
 		this is true yeah
 		well um-hum well do we go until they cut us off or
