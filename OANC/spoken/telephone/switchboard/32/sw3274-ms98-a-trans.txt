 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right now since i'm from the great
 		Midwest north you know we're right on Lake Erie
 		uh i'm sure our climates are much different than yours are
 		typically today we've got uh rain we're forecasting a little bit of sleet
 		and uh which means i'm not gonna do any lawn and gardening today that's for sure
 	
 	
 		yes i can understand
 	
 	
 		so i don't know what's the weather down there and
 	
 	
 		oh it's nice and sunny here uh it's uh little little Christmas uh crispness in the air
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh delightful to be outside
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and right now i'm watering
 	
 	
 		yeah it's not
 		are you really   we avoid having to send you a little bit
 	
 	
 		yes
 		and my lawn is very green and my flowers are still blooming
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i have that
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 	
 	
 		i still have that we have mums and geraniums that are still holding their own out there uh lot of the other ones i've i've already had to pull out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh at this point i'm ready to start putting in uh some bulbs i'm waiting for a decent some decent weather for that i got uh about two hundred bulbs i've got to put in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i have a uh
 		mine's a new home and we just really did the landscaping this year so i've got
 		about all the gardening i want for the year so i'll be anxious to to let it rest for a little bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh somebody i talked to last week was said they had the uh they had problems doing some of the work down there because they they really had some heat hanging on
 	
 	
 		well course that's a constant factor down here what you have to do is uh keep your uh keep your ground uh watered
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh the heat really doesn't bother you if you have the right kind of flowers
 	
 	
 		yeah all right
 	
 	
 		or and the right kind of lawn for that matter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i have a tiff Bermuda lawn here and uh it requires a lot of water and you have to keep it cut very short if you want it to look like a golf course green
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't uh get to it that often so mine doesn't look like a golf course course but it is very nice and uh and shiny and uh very thin grass
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		grows real close together
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's very okay it's very very different than ours because ours ours we get into a lot of combinations of rye and Kentucky Blue
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh plus the usual amount of crabgrass and weeds and everything else that pops through and
 		uh but we've had an a terrible drought this year and everybody's going through the same kind of problems in fact we developed on a new lawn we developed what they call rust
 		and it's a fungus which is very very rare but our whole area they're all new homes and new lawns and it was it was very
 		very much in evidence this year as everything turns yellow
 	
 	
 		turns yellow early huh
 	
 	
 		well it just turns yellow where it shouldn't and you walk across walk across the lawn and your shoes will actually come out rust colored
 	
 	
 		and it's it's not it's not a disease it's a disease and not a lack of a of chemicals
 	
 	
 		no it's it's a fungus and they claim that it is caused by stress to the lawn it it won't kill the lawn but it sure doesn't do much for the looks of the lawn
 	
 	
 		huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh the alternative is a lot of uh nitrogen overpowering with nitrogen fertilizer and
 		certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come spring come spring it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal
 	
 	
 		well i have grub worms here off and on i try to keep them under control they live right up under the surface of the ground and they eat the roots of your grass and then you have ground  brown uh patches develop
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that's when you first notice it but you can put some uh chemical on that and kill them out and keep them under control you never destroy them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you enjoy lawn work
 	
 	
 		oh very much so uh we have a lake house down at Cedar Creek Texas seventy five miles uh north uh or rather uh uh southeast uh southeast of uh Dallas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i have to  to grow uh rye grass down there because we're not there to water although we have a watering system no one's there to turn it on and i guess uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well we don't have an automatic sprinkler either see so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh or automatic on the sprinkler system
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh you know the rye grass and the uh wild grass that grow makes us a nice lawn
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah it sounds nice Cedar Lake i'm not uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		oh it's a very large uh man-made lake uh in Texas it's about uh a hundred and uh fifty miles i guess in Fort Worth
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and it supplies Fort Worth with it's drinking water
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		and then a hundred and eighty miles further south of there uh or rather a hundred and eighty miles from Fort Worth about
 		forty miles south of Cedar Creek is another mammoth lake that Fort Worth owns
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that it uses to water
 	
 	
 		yeah that's interesting i never realized the uh the amount of lake
