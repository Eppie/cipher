 		well  i from i grew up in the Deep South like south Alabama so whenever i think of family reunions my family like got together almost every week
 	
 	
 		oh gee
 	
 	
 		and there'd be like thirty people so people talk about you know big family reunions and i i think like i have a friend who just went to like Wyoming to some big ranch you know where like there were four hundred people
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		for for their family reunion and i  so i mean how i would go about doing it is i would just call all my  relatives
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because i since i came from my father has uh five sisters and two brothers and my mother has four brothers and two sisters
 		so i can both of my parents had big families
 		and we always were we always got together just always
 		now it's different because i live here and i've you know when i go home i try to see the families as much of the family as i can but it's real different and i grew up in a real not  i think not normal setting
 	
 	
 		yes
 		with all of you living so close together
 	
 	
 		right i mean Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's and you know like i said there'd be thirty  you know a thirty people and everyone would just bring things and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		well i come from a very small family and we planned a family reunion this spring um where we are from Texas and my family's from Ohio and we met in Florida
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together
 		so that's all the family so planning our family reunion reunion was very easy
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so and  sounds like it was fun
 	
 	
 		yeah it was we had a wonderful time
