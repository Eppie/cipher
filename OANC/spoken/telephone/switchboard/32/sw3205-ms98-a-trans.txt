 
     		
 	
 		question was on lawn and garden work um how do you like it
 	
 	
 		well i don't do much of it here i'm from uh Texas from uh Colorado originally and there are no bugs there and i didn't mind getting in the dirt there but boy i'll tell you what once i see these bugs around here i'm just kind of out of it
 	
 	
 		ooh what kind do you have
 	
 	
 		oh roaches and oh yes cockroaches are awful here just awful  so i
 	
 	
 		do they really
 		oh oh and i know somebody that lives there and they never mentioned that problem
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding you're kidding no it's a  well maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here and uh
 	
 	
 		oh my they probably just take it for granted then
 	
 	
 		it it must be if they lived here a lot of people i know just say oh i just stomp on them it doesn't matter they make good fertilizer in the garden  me personally can't
 	
 	
 		ooh yuck  no i i don't have that problem uh it's mine is mainly we kind of have an understanding that uh i i said i'll do inside work you do outside work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that but i don't like i don't getting dirty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no i have to you know i have to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really
 	
 	
 		no i don't know we got the we got the question and i thought oh this is gonna be interesting uh two bits i'll get a man to talk to because they get stuck doing it all  but although i do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so um we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall today we just had
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		a lot of rain  yeah so it's kind of nice i don't know how yours has been
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well it's been real hot here lately i mean we've had to actually have the air conditioning on and everything but uh  it's supposed to rain again now uh this weekend
 	
 	
 		oh i see okay well we're we're leaving tomorrow and we're going down to New Orleans and from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie this is gonna be a switch for us for a week
 	
 	
 		so then
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		going down there and i think we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity but um as far as the gardening and things like that goes i don't know uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		too much too much about uh how much i really really do enjoy it myself do you like it at all
 	
 	
 		i well not here i mean it's just here i just can't stand to even get out in the uh in the dirt  just
 	
 	
 		well how about when you were in Colorado
 	
 	
 		well i liked it a little bit but i didn't uh i was working at that time full time and didn't have a lot of time for that and so that i think really um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		hampered it a little bit
 	
 	
 		well and then and too now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly my water bill was
 		high and uh if you have that on regular basis in Texas i think i would go with something very dry  to keep keep it off you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh and with children um you probably don't have time anyhow to to get into it
 	
 	
 		no
 		not really  i'm fine
 	
 	
 		it's so uh okay very good i guess we've kind of covered our subject matter since neither one's really into gardening are we
 	
 	
 		sounds like it
 		no no afraid not hopefully they'll get a subject i like one of these times  something i really know a lot about well it's nice nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		right okay right nice talking with you um-hum bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
