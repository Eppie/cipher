 		well i still don't trust them i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you don't
 	
 	
 		i probably never will
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't think they have enough control to really uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to really do anything against us i think i don't think they're as strong as we think they are
 		personally but yeah but i see what i see your point because you know they they feed us propaganda
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we never know what they're thinking
 	
 	
 		that's right i don't trust maybe i guess it's because of the way what happened over there with their own people how they threw him out of power and
 		you know just a big uproar but then you know me and my husband always talk about it because they're running out of money
 	
 	
 		right
 		sure
 	
 	
 		you know and what are they going to do when they run out of food are they going to just attack us and take it  it makes you wonder
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because you know we already we have enough problems over here that we don't need  to be trying to help everybody else which that that gets on my nerves too but
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i think taking you know when we
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		took that uh went to war with Iraq i think we that was kind of a uh display of power
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think we showed i think the Soviet Union knows what we have and knows
 		that we're pretty serious and if they ever tried to do anything
 		we would we would be on the offensive
 	
 	
 		yeah but i don't i think they have just as much see but i don't know i i think that they have better like we you know when we go over in Iraq and Iran that's different country but i think see that's why they don't have anything in the Soviet Union they spent more money
 		on um what do you call um military power than anything they have more of a expense of military than we do
 	
 	
 		yeah but are they going to have the backing from the people
 		you know
 	
 	
 		well now see that's another problem is they have it in their own thing with all this uh what do you call it uh
 		breaking up of the Soviet Union right now i doubt if they had a help of anybody in their country
 	
 	
 		right
 		right because there's fifteen different republics
 	
 	
 		they're having so many
 		right now  it's like whoa  so i don't know if they would have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know but it just depends on when
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they do it so i guess it would depend on what what state that they're in
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		when they do it but i still wouldn't trust them not i would trust them only so much
 	
 	
 		well
 		right i don't i don't even think we should you know i i don't think it's a matter of trust even anymore i mean it's just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay you lay this down we'll lay this down but that doesn't mean we we're not we're going to stop watching you and making sure you're not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		doing what you supposed to do
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i think that's what they're trying to do is to get us to do everything you know and them not really do anything because who's checking them
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i think that not only if we check them they're not going it's just like coming over here in the United States the government don't tell you everything
 	
 	
 		i know it
 	
 	
 		they feel they don't have to which i agree
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because if you tell everybody everything everybody in the world would know because they'd put it on TV
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that wouldn't do us any good so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right i just a you know
 		that that's another thing that scares me is our country
 	
 	
 		they're so into TV
 	
 	
 		you know what are we doing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what are they actually telling us and after you know what happened the other day with that uh CIA guy you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how much is what all the wars we're getting into and all this you know the messes we're we're involving us ourselves with
 	
 	
 		that we really don't that we don't know about
 	
 	
 		right  is that true or you know is it
 		was Panama really a threat
 	
 	
 		how much of it is true and how much and how much of it is propaganda
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know what are what are what are we supposed to believe
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i don't i don't trust the government here more than i trust you know to a point
 	
 	
 		that's the thing i'm having a hard time with
 	
 	
 		but then just like i'm not going to trust another government just because
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		there's no way
 		especially when they've been such a
 		oh
 		a power to us you know a force that we have to watch constantly a threat but yet now they're going to be our friends
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		no that's like Little Red Riding Hood to me
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you know letting the wolf in and saying oh that's okay
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we're going to sit here but we're not we're going to watch each other
 		and i think whoever wins the the wait
 		is probably the one
 	
 	
 		well if it just keeps on going and nobody ever does anything that's fine with me
 	
 	
 		yeah as long as i don't care about that they can do whatever they want but
 		i don't want it to get to
