 
     		
 	
 		uh what kind of car would you uh buy next
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's a good question we just got in from looking at cars and we've probably been looking at them for a couple months and we haven't bought one yet  so that almost answers the question how about you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh you have okay
 		oh and you haven't
 		um we just bought one um we bought one about a month ago it was a ninety one Ford Thunderbird
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um we really liked it because um we just moved here from South Dakota and we have we do some quite a bit of traveling
 		and that was a nice car to travel in but we have also a Ford Probe and that's better to get around town in because the Thunderbird takes a lot of gas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um the reason we're stuck on Fords i guess is because i used to sell Fords and so we're kind of stuck on that kind of a car but
 		i really like um that kind of car myself but
 	
 	
 		well we we've been looking at  just about everything i guess because we really don't need a car we just sort of  want the luxury of buying a new car and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know we were today we were looking at Lexuses and we keep going back to Cadillacs
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		and looking at those and then you don't know if you wanna spend thirty thousand dollars and buy a new car or whether you wanna buy uh like a ninety one Cadillac a ninety or ninety one for you know twenty or nineteen or fifteen you can get them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		fairly cheap compared to buying a brand new one  and the new Lexus that that they have that you you pay sticker price for those
 	
 	
 		a Lexus
 		yeah
 		uh-huh and isn't that neat though that is a neat car don't you think
 	
 	
 		yes yes we we were  we were all in them today but you know when it comes to oops
 	
 	
 		
 
 		were you
 	
 	
 		you know do you wanna spend about thirty thousand dollars and uh it'd probably be a little over that with the tax  so that's that's really where
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		where we are or should we just buy you know a little Volkswagen we've right we've you know the one of those Cabriolets i guess they're called uh it's a convertible it's sort of like you know square in the back
 	
 	
 		yeah and get around town
 		uh-huh yeah i like those
 	
 	
 		but the the selling point i guess that that i or it has to pass my test i'm i'm short and i need to sit in the seat see if i can get the seat high enough to see over the steering wheel like i like to see
 	
 	
 		are you shorter
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm  about five two
 	
 	
 		are you oh then that's yeah
 	
 	
 		and to make sure the seat belt doesn't hit me in the neck that it comes really over the shoulder and not up around your neck so
 	
 	
 		yeah it's got to be a comfortable car
 	
 	
 		right well it can be comfortable but those things not all the seat belts are gonna work that way nor can i get all the seats up high enough
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to do that so uh so on those we just we just forget about
 	
 	
 		yeah that certainly helps
 	
 	
 		and we've been looking at cars with leather seats but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know this is a new experience for us just just mainly because my uh my mother had died which meant that we were coming into some money that we could
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		splurge and buy a car but but yet it's difficult to do though when you're not used to it so that's why we're we're out uh
 	
 	
 		oh and isn't that nice
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sort of doing this and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah buying a car is hard you never know for sure if you're getting a good deal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we've always bought used cars before and they haven't been very expensive um so this is just just a new
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a new thing you know we've had vans we've had a new van and you know some other another new car that that wasn't used but the prices are what
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		used to buy a house for
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i know because we came down here and you know and well you know from down here it but price of housing is a lot different
 	
 	
 		um-hum i bet
 	
 	
 		but the but the price of our house up in Aberdeen was as much as some cars and it's like you know oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right it's hard to adjust to it and and you just don't want to really
 	
 	
 		no because it's like this thing it moves moves and could be wrecked and that's like we you know get a house for this and uh it just blows our mind um but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right uh-huh
 		well i hope you enjoy your car uh we we looked at Thunderbirds um i guess maybe about a couple weeks ago we seem to do this every
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		every weekend we've been out looking for  for we still haven't bought yet so i guess every every month we don't buy we save more money than we  we're just shopping shopping is free until you buy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right interest
 		
 
 		yeah well that's great you know because you might as well get what you want you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but it would be it would be nice our son works for EDS and and we could use his um
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		discount that he gets through General Motors
 	
 	
 		yes that's right
 	
 	
 		except uh
 		we were only out looking at General Motors cars except Cadillac and we're not looking at the at the new ones anyway and in the Cadillacs and they're not using they're not getting um discounts on the new
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Cadillacs that we're looking would would be looking at to begin with so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh are you in Dallas
 	
 	
 		yes Plano
 	
 	
 		yeah so am i  are you looking at the Crest or Crest
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah we were just got back from there yeah that was our last stop about you know about eight thirty i said oh we can always swing around Crest so there we go and we're swinging around yes we've gotten two cars two used cars from Crest
