 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay changes what how how old are you
 	
 	
 		i am twenty
 	
 	
 		twenty oh boy  i'm thirty three i feel a lot older uh  what do you think the changes are
 	
 	
 		yeah how old are you
 		oh
 		
 
 		um
 		hm  um i just think it's more acceptable for women to um be in the workplace than uh i guess it was a long time ago um
 		that's
 	
 	
 		acceptable as in um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		like
 		i just think that they were expected to be at home more before
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and now it's more
 		prevalent i guess
 	
 	
 		i  work for a really big corporation and we are uh NCNB
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and we've got  a lot of women in the in the company and i'm a lawyer too so it's like this you know i i've got a i perspective working for a big corporation and a professional working for a big corporation
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i i you know there are a lot of women here there are a lot of women in power positions but uh
 		and and that's just all wonderful and hunky-dory and aren't we progressive business but there are very very few women in uh in senior positions
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		on on not you know not on the board of directors uh   you know not in senior level management  and i don't know if that's from um i don't know that's
 		uh just because there hasn't been time or whether there's a glass you know what they call a glass ceiling
 	
 	
 		um-hum so you just don't think that it's as
 		do you think that's good or bad or
 	
 	
 		i i think it's i think what you're saying is true and that it's acceptable and okay women get out and work but i don't know that um they're they're really expected they're really then um
 		in i hate to use the word again accepted in the position of being workers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know yeah y'all get out there and do that but you know we're not gonna  you know we're not gonna make a chairman of the board
 	
 	
 		right
 		and why do you think that why why do you think that is just
 	
 	
 		just just because i don't see it i also i work with a lot of law firms and a lot of companies and you know most of the most of the uh movers and shakers are men
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then in the bank even most of the you know there are a few women that really stand out but you know most of the young eager ones you know the oh the young wonder children are men
 	
 	
 		do you think it's because they have the qualifications or because not at all
 	
 	
 		no  no uh well i don't know i think maybe some of it's because uh uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't no and i'm i'm not certain i don't know
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		seems like some of the women they maybe the women aren't motivated uh
 		but
 	
 	
 		they just are willing to take the backseat or
 	
 	
 		right i'm gonna go in and be a clerk
 		and no you're just as smart as the fellow you're working for
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's what i see a lot of
 		i wrote my senior research paper on the Equal Rights Amendment so i'm kind of an activist yes yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		are you really
 		so you're pretty um liberal as far as
 	
 	
 		i'm very liberal  and i speaking to someone in Provo Utah
 	
 	
 		well um  yeah i i don't know i'm more of a
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess i'm more conservative in my viewpoints i mean i think it's great if they want it if  you know women wanna do that and i'm planning on being a nurse so  but
 		i don't know i
 	
 	
 		how many men are there in in in you know the nursing profession
 	
 	
 		very few  very few
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		and and why is that
 	
 	
 		because they think it's a woman's job probably
 	
 	
 		yeah i know but
 	
 	
 		uh or maybe men wanna earn more money i i don't
 	
 	
 		i did exactly
 	
 	
 		want wanna earn more money so they can support family i don't
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i my sister-in-law's a nurse i know what she does and it's she has a lot of responsibility i mean she just doesn't change bedpans and uh
 	
 	
 		right the you just don't think that it pays off i mean like i i found out like
 		the all the doctor comes comes in and does is the like end delivery is come in and deliver deliver the baby i mean all the pre-everything is nurse nurses but the doctors get the bucks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly they get the bucks and they get the and the recognition for it and all the patient sees is this woman you know hovering around yeah and you know yanking on wires and and IV cords and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i i and i don't think that i don't think that nurses get half the recognition they ought to for example
 	
 	
 		oh definitely i i agree
