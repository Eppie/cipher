 
     		
 	
 		okay let's talk about schooling
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah uh what what what contacts do you have with uh public school system
 	
 	
 		okay well i have a boy and he just went into middle school early  and i have a girl and she's in uh grade school
 		and then i have a little boy who goes to uh they have something just before kindergarten and it's called Early Childhood and i have a young a young boy in that
 	
 	
 		oh okay um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i i have a lot of children in in the school system down here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i think we have excellent teachers here i am really uh like the students like the way the teachers work with the students
 		uh i've not been so um
 		happy with the schools  themselves i guess like my last year my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school and it was just packed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean it was a a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it was just a real problem uh so we had to do a bond issue and and um
 		vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what the preferred to do
 		or to uh work on the school work for another school to be built
 		which is a good idea but in the meantime the school still has lots and lots of kids in it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so um i think one thing is that would maybe we don't have enough schools and secondly when we have enough schools
 		sometimes we can't get the the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think that's i think that's uh true i i've got a a little different uh contact but i've i've got a one son that graduated from high school last year and another son that's a
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		a sophomore this year and uh my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson  ah but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		in general i i think that the you know one of the reasons that we we uh
 		the choice to live in Richardson when we when we came here was the was the schools and i think that Plano and Richardson in terms of the uh
 		uh things seriously wrong with the public schools are are not nearly to the extent that that
 	
 	
 		we see through the out the country name
 	
 	
 		and right right and i think and i think part of that is that is the the uh your big part of that is just uh the demographics the population in those schools are are
 		typically uh people that very much value the education and support the the school systems and and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum i think that's right
 	
 	
 		although there is still some still some problems but uh
 		i i you know i when when i was when i was going to school and i grew up in Iowa and and we in my family school was certainly valued but if there was ever any sort of a uh
 		if ever if i was ever in trouble in school i was also in trouble at home and and even more so and i think that that part of it is is not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		exactly with the schools but with the with the uh
 		the culture that doesn't doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support uh
 	
 	
 		the home yeah
 		uh i think that's right
 	
 	
 		what the schools are are trying to do
 	
 	
 		it is so hard with a family system um either divorced or or just one parent or just
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		uh like and then if both of them have to work even that is a a hard situation
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for the children uh to to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think it's really important that the parents work with the school um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think what you said is is really a pinpoint though that the student and the family life really adds or detracts from what's happening in the school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um well what about your wife is she she happy at school or  she's just ready
 	
 	
 		well uh she she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher she she has she has two half day classes so she has uh
 	
 	
 		oh i bet she does
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know  on the order of twice as many students as as the teachers in the higher grades and uh uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but her her background is in is in uh
 		child development and and uh so forth and so kindergarten is as high as she as she wants to teach and she's she's teaching rather than something else because that that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's the jobs that are available and that the schedule matches uh you know with our kids and things like that so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah uh and but uh the
