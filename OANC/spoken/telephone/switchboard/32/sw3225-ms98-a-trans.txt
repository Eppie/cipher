 
     		
 	
 		okay so you're into microwave cooking
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's just it's so easy nowadays you know and it's uh especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave and it be ready in just a few minutes
 	
 	
 		and that yes and that's what we all are looking for isn't it something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends
 		so that i have leftovers all week
 	
 	
 		all week well we've done that too there's just my husband and i and he he sometimes makes a huge spot of uh pot of spaghetti and we
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know we're eating it for a week and a half and i kind of get sick of it after a few days
 	
 	
 		i know i try not to make too much it's just my husband and i too and i try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week but uh i usually i usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or you know something like that or sometimes a roast but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		what's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party
 	
 	
 		um i have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's it's really good i got it from a friend of mine that i used to work with and uh every time i've served it everybody just loves it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		ooh that sounds delicious
 	
 	
 		so that's that's one of my favorite things to make  what about you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		we i end up with an old standby that we call Russian chicken because it's so easy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it goes you have to cook very little to go with it just some rice and some salad and that's about it you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well what do you put in it
 	
 	
 		uh you make you just take your boneless chicken breasts and then you take and make a a dressing out of uh Russian dressing one bottle of that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and three ounces of apricot preserves
 	
 	
 		ooh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and you mix it up and you just put it on the top of the chicken and then i cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then i take the foil off and let it brown
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		takes about another twenty minutes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's delicious
 	
 	
 		ooh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and it's so simple because i can pop it in when i come in the door you know and then uh go about my business and by the time i've got everything else ready the chicken's ready chicken's done
 	
 	
 		is done right
 	
 	
 		so that's a real easy thing for me
 	
 	
 		yeah that sounds good too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've got a um  a great recipe for cheesecake
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i don't know if you get Southern Living that magazine
 	
 	
 		no i don't my mom gets that but
 	
 	
 		they have one if you like to cook they have every recipe i've tried out of that has been a really good one
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and um you know every month they've got all different kinds of recipes but
 		i got one in there about a year or so ago on cheesecake and it's just a regular cheesecake and then you can put raspberry um topping on it but inside the cheesecake uh recipe you put um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		lemon peel and orange peel
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and it's just enough to taste it you know when when when you're eating the cheesecake and it is wonderful but it takes a long time because you have to cook it for
 		forty five minutes and then you turn the oven off and you leave it in the oven for another forty five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty five minutes
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and then you're supposed to um i think chill it to room temperature
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so sometimes i'll do that overnight and then put the topping on the next day but it's it's very good
 	
 	
 		well i love cheesecake i have never been i don't know the ones i have made i have not done that well with
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i like a baked cheesecake you know i don't i've had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it you know but that's not the same as a a New York style cheesecake
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		no no
 	
 	
 		and uh the recipes that i've used everybody will say oh this is real simple and then i make it and it's it's really not very good
 	
 	
 		it's not
 		right
 	
 	
 		but yours sounds good i bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness
 	
 	
 		it does and it it it is really good
 	
 	
 		hm well that sounds interesting so there's your good dessert for your dinner party
 	
 	
 		it is it is pretty good
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		are you into serving wines with your dinner party
 	
 	
 		oh sometimes but i mean i'm not a wine connoisseur by any means
 	
 	
 		me either i wish i knew more about it
 	
 	
 		i've been to you know some wine tastings up in Napa Valley but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and i learned a little bit about them then but you know what would be fun they have some of those classes you can take
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		they would be if you just had time to do it
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah and then there's places um do you live in Dallas okay there's places here that um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		offer i think it's like once a month you can go and to a particular restaurant or whatever and you can kind of take a cooking class
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then you get to eat everything afterwards and then they also go into the wines you know to serve with you know different types of of meals and that kind of thing and it sounds like it's a lot of fun we have some friends who've done that and they've really enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		well how neat
 		um-hum
 		hm well i didn't even know they were offering that i guess i
 	
 	
 		yeah this place is called like Medina's or Mesina's Kitchen or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh well i bet that'd be a fun thing to do
 	
 	
 		yeah it it sounds like like it
