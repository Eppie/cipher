 
     		
 	
 		what what do you feel is the the major change that's been going on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's a tough question we're now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework right
 	
 	
 		i think that has been the major change is that
 	
 	
 		don't ask me
 	
 	
 		women feel they need to go out and do this they they no longer feel it's um   it's no big deal to to stay home and raise your family anymore
 	
 	
 		well it has no credibility anymore
 	
 	
 		i know it and i i think i think that's really sad because i think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else
 	
 	
 		well i'm a school teacher and i'm in charge of raising them so i can appreciate it
 	
 	
 		you don't well  i'm i'm still home with with my last one and i wouldn't trade change a minute of it for anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh good for you good for you
 	
 	
 		but i i can't i can't help but think that
 		eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again
 	
 	
 		well you know it's interesting because when i heard the topic i was thinking uh this summer Oprah had a TV show
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		about wives that refused to go to work and how their husbands thought they were terrible
 		and one woman had four children
 		and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family and that's frightening
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's yeah it it's sad
 	
 	
 		and it's you know it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a
 		social issue
 		yeah people were siding with the husband saying you've got to go to work if you have these four children you've got to support them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life style than necessary
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh you know to i i don't think you know the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and and and this type of thing i think that they would from the you know attention or whatever
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh but i i uh i
 		i don't know i i see it as a major problem and i think it's going to have to swing back the other way because i think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know i as i said i teach school and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		gosh i'm trying to think i don't know i have one woman
 		one mother that i know is home
 		but she also has ten children
 	
 	
 		what what grade do you teach
 	
 	
 		six seven and eight
 	
 	
 		six seven and eight i've got a child uh where do you live are you out
 	
 	
 		in Richardson
 	
 	
 		in Richardson we're in Plano here and i have a daughter in middle school and uh i know there aren't very many but she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home but do you see
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		um you know do you ever do you ever see problems you know that you feel you know that the kids are are left alone too much and
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		yeah i've got one child um that stays with me everyday till five because his mother doesn't come home until seven and he doesn't wanna to be home from three thirty to seven by himself
 	
 	
 		he stays at school and the school allows that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well he stays with me and i have a tendency to work late i work till six
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so he stays with me till five thirty and then goes home
 		and you know i have lots of kids because they know i'm there late i'm a slow mover to say the least but um they'll come in and say can i stay with you because i don't wanna go home to an empty house
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that's frightening because you know the when i said i i'm i'm raising them i am because we're talking about boyfriends and we're talking about
 		what the girl said in class and you know what's right because there's no mother at home to do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		no mother to talk to
 	
 	
 		and um
 		it makes a difference i've and just the social values
 	
 	
 		well i've  do you do you feel it will swing back the other way or do you feel there's just going to be a big push to uh you know for for more more and more day care type situations
 	
 	
 		i i don't know
 		i i have a feeling we're gonna go more and more i've got a twenty one year old
 		female and i've got twenty two year old male
 		children child children and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i listen to my daughter and she's going to work and she's going to buy her house and she's gonna get her car and then she's gonna have her children
 		and then when you know they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their lifestyle is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they back to work and you know i agree with you i was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we live without them we did fine
