 
     		
 	
 		um i don't i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i am only twenty eight and i haven't had much experience with nursing homes i don't i have never visited any  i don't think i've ever even been in one have you
 	
 	
 		um actually i have um
 		i've i've been in them
 		but um just visiting and
 		um we used to go when we're like in in our teenagers we'd go on Sundays and visit you know the older people but um i have a elderly grandmother that lives with us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she's lived with us for like five years so i kind of know how it is to have to decide if you wanna put somebody in a rest home or
 		um  like we i mean we've had those discussions you know about should we put her in or because she's pretty senile and
 	
 	
 		and it takes it takes a lot of care like twenty four hours a day someone has to be well like there's someone in my my fiance's family his grandmother too and they're
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's really
 	
 	
 		that his her
 		son his uncle whatever you know anyway  he he has he recently retired and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke and and all the other children
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um are working or whatever they're all my parent's age and uh so he's got you know his retirement though is really twenty four hours a day they have a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		day care  two days a week they call it senior citizen day care but she goes to the senior citizen center
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so she he gets a break two days a week but it's only for like two or three hours at a time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know just you see a lot of things like you you know was always a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but he refuses to consider any other
 		i i don't know yeah and is that how your parents feel or
 	
 	
 		to put her in a rest home
 		um  well see it's more of my grandma that feels that way she says that when her husband died that he said
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh that my uncle had said that he would never have put her in a rest home
 		so it's kind of
 		uh i don't know  i don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to
 		have like a little toilet right by her bed it's and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it gets
 		i don't know it's it's a hard decision but i don't think i would do it to my parents personally
 	
 	
 		i know at this i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either you know but i i really feel bad for the people i see that not very i'm not really really experienced but like i said just have that one
 		family and that's really so bad for the guy who his whole life is different now and than he thought it would be but
 	
 	
 		when he retired
 	
 	
 		yeah and he's got you know seven brothers and sisters and and uh he's the one because he's the one that doesn't going to work everyday and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone and
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's worked out good for us just because my uncle and my and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months
 	
 	
 		i can't say much oh well that's great that's a good idea we ought to
 	
 	
 		so that that works out good
 	
 	
 		yeah and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever i don't know what they're gonna do it's really not my family it's my fiance's so i don't
 		i can't say much but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either and i wonder i'm gonna be the only
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sibling that isn't gonna have children so if my parents do need to live with someone it'll probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		you know and i'm i that's fine with me  my fiancee i both figure that's what's we're gonna end up with both of the parents or whoever if it you know what i mean we feel like it's our responsibility and i feel like i would never put them in a home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i wonder how much you know if one of us is gonna have to quit work someday or retire early or something you think about it and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's really i don't know this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country and
 	
 	
 		you think i i
 		i'm not really familiar with how other countries
 	
 	
 		it's really more of a um like a respect issue
 		and that the older the older people in other countries that i've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people and and they really seen as wise and and in this country nobody really
 	
 	
 		they're seen as senile
 	
 	
 		yeah nobody really pays attention and they oh the old timer made with the old way and nobody respects the traditions and you know it's
 		i i'm not saying that i do either but  you know it's just funny and and we really don't have any they don't have social security and everything really isn't that much for
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		elderly people to live on you know even if they're in good health it's incredible they don't have any they don't get special treatment and maybe they should you know because we're all gonna get old someday
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 		i know
 	
 	
 		so it's a  it's kind of depressing topic though how old are you
 	
 	
 		um i'm twenty
 	
 	
 		so it is yeah and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it really is but and she
 		she drives us crazy
