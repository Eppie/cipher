 
     		
 	
 		so what do you think about it
 	
 	
 		well i found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said well if there is a problem what should we do about it
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i guess that's so
 	
 	
 		do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh i think there are some problems but they're not really big ones i think that
 		um
 		in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be
 		that it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here like even if they're educated and will be a good asset to America
 		it's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that
 	
 	
 		okay that's interesting i was i was wondering what your response would be i'm a first generation American
 	
 	
 		okay uh where did you come from
 	
 	
 		so i'm from immigrant parents  or an immigrant mother anyway
 	
 	
 		okay okay so where did your parents come from
 	
 	
 		uh Poland
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and that was you know prior to World War Two
 	
 	
 		and
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it's interesting that
 		you know
 		with the topic  i think i agree with you there needs to be more of an open policy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know we have to remember the Chinese came here and were our labor you know for the railroad Transatlantic Railroad and
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		our Irish came and you know built the towns and
 		did labor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but what do you think are you from Texas or
 	
 	
 		i'm from Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		Pennsylvania okay well that'll be interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right and um a lot of
 	
 	
 		because we have just had a naturalization act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas i'm from Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and have become citizens now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what do you think about that
 	
 	
 		um i think that's all right
 		i um
 		at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing do you have an opinion about it
 	
 	
 		well i agree with it wholeheartedly the only thing is i've got to share with you and my background is from New Jersey
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so when you were giving your answer i was thinking
 		is this a Texan i'm talking to  because Texan philosophy is a little different
 	
 	
 		no okay
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well a lot of the experience that i have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's Chinese and immigrated from China and um
 		you know he
 		um got a green card is and is in good standing in America and in China but only because he was always pretty nice to the Chinese government
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and all that and he was always on pretty good terms with them
 	
 	
 		yeah well we
 	
 	
 		but um their
 		my sister just had a baby and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing
 		and it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem
 		it's just very difficult to
 		get a a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here
 	
 	
 		oh well then you have first in the experience on immigration
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that is interesting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah well i well i wonder you know even with those that were involved with Tiananmen Square
 		you know did we really protect them
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah that's and i think that's pretty crazy because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean those students who were in America when that was happening
 		are
 		almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back
 		and
 		besides that they're the best and brightest of China so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can
 	
 	
 		that is true
 		that is true
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		well what do you think about we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that has been brought in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what do you think about that
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and these are not the brightest i mean we
 	
 	
 		see these are refugees you mean okay
 	
 	
 		we're talking boat people
 	
 	
 		right okay
 	
 	
 		we have a lot of boat people in Texas
 	
 	
 		right well um
 		i don't have any problem with that um
 	
 	
 		you're a true liberal heart-to-heart good for you  i was ready for a fight on this one
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so  uh-huh right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		no i agree because um interesting my when my daughter was in high school
 		one of the custodians was Vietnamese
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and with his limited English they found out through you know that  she was in student council and they found out that he was a medical doctor
