 
     		
 	
 		okay where do you enjoy dining out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap
 	
 	
 		yes do you have children
 	
 	
 		uh we have four but most of them are gone now so there there might be but we were taking you know uh four five and six people out
 	
 	
 		ah
 		yes that makes a difference doesn't it uh-huh what area of the country do you live in
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i'm in Texas
 	
 	
 		yes i am too
 	
 	
 		and we lived we lived in Ohio prior to this oh
 	
 	
 		so
 		i did too  i'm from the Dayton area
 	
 	
 		uh we were up near Cleveland yeah
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		but i look for service even at the quickie places type things uh i don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong and then you're stuck and it's a pain to have to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		stand there and see what it is before you leave so i really don't like the drive-thrus that much i i like to go and eat there
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but i would say service uh atmosphere and whether the food is good on on going out i like steaks  so we try to hit those places when we can
 	
 	
 		when we travel we look for Wendy's because we have kids and my husband and i like getting the salads or the lighter meals and then that way they can get their burgers and fries and we can have a salad bar
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy's because it's all either McDonald's or Dairy Queens  but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh  yeah and in in in the countries unless it's a large city i guess Dairy Queen and Wal-Mart are their main  that's what you find right
 	
 	
 		right that's right
 		i know
 	
 	
 		my husband likes um Dairy Queens he likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs i guess so he's a fan of of Dairy Queen and and we'll go even in town here at times just as a a change although
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm not that excited about it it we've eaten we eat out so much it's gotten so i don't like to really eat any place but yet i hate to cook food at home
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that might be why i look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		nights a week maybe or we eat junk food at home
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh now that my husband
 	
 	
 		so what are some of your your favorite inexpensive places
 	
 	
 		oh we'll go to them all we sort of take turns and and we uh i'm sort of favor the ones if i have a coupon we can go there and if not we can't
 		because it's cheaper so mine is monetarily i guess strongly monetarily
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		based uh we'll go get pizza and uh at Little Caesar's although the kids prefer Domino's
 	
 	
 		oh we are Little Caesar fans here that's where we always go
 	
 	
 		right
 		but it's just a lot cheaper than than Domino's so that's
 		we go to Grandy's quite a bit i would say
 	
 	
 		yes we like Grandy's too
 	
 	
 		McDonald's uh we've sort of been off of that for a while and no particular reason and i i maybe we avoided Wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there and she never wanted us show up there
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i don't uh we don't go
 		there that much
 	
 	

 		where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out or a big meal
 	
 	
 		a nice meal oh
 	
 	
 		where you go for steaks
 	
 	
 		it's usually when we're out of town and i'll order steak or steak and lobster combined
 	
 	
 		ah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that it's really not in town
 	
 	
 		ah you ever been to Houston's on Beltline
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		that's where we go to get steaks they have a teriyaki steak there and when we have something to celebrate we head to Houston's they don't take reservations and you wind up waiting about an hour
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but the food is good and they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink unless you get there at five o'clock then you can go right through
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks so
 		that's our nice place to go we don't usually take the kids when we go there
 	
 	
 		don't well we don't go out that much i guess well i guess we do go out without kids we're usually picking things up quickly though and just we just don't
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		dwell on food too much and uh with my husband traveling he can get all he needs  for that during the week going to those places so it it doesn't really matter to him he'd probably just like to stay home
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right
 		yeah that's the way with my husband he's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends and i've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so we have a conflict of interests on the weekends
 	
 	
 		well i think our i i never have liked to cook food but i think it all began eating out when we had uh the boys in in different uh
 		baseball on baseball team it was mainly baseball teams and my husband would coach
 	
 	
 		right
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so we were never home at the same time and i'm not one that's going to fix you know the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there if they're not there in between five and six well then i guess we don't eat today or you go you know you fend for yourself you go somewhere else
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		yep
 	
 	
 		so that you know that really snowballed when we got down here when i started to sub make money i went oh well i'll just sub to
