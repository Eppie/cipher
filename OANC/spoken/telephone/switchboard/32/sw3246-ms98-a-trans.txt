 
     		
 	
 		do you see anything wrong with public school systems
 	
 	
 		well yes i do um i think i'm concerned about the large number of children that
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		each teacher is expected to to deal with in some quality way i think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		do you do you have children in the public school system
 	
 	
 		yes and i taught for fourteen years
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		before we moved to Texas and the the one thing i see is changing is
 		i was held accountable so much i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children
 	
 	
 		you you were a bookkeeper  oh
 	
 	
 		everything had to be documented and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids it was filled with documentation
 	
 	
 		oh no well um i'm i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back and and i'm just really in a dilemma if that's what you know i'd love
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		to work with children and to teach them but i'm really having questions if if i can deal with that system and and have a good conscience about you know what i do i don't think
 	
 	
 		me too
 	
 	
 		i don't think it's the teachers i think it's the system but um
 	
 	
 		i think so too
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores that children get on tests now
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and teacher competency you know and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best she's always worried whose looking over her shoulder and
 	
 	
 		what child's gonna say something some parent's going to overreact to that's
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		i know
 	
 	
 		that's true  well it's it's hard on the children too i think you know because the um the teachers are overworked and just like a mommy that's overworked you're not at your best you know um and
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		do you have children in the system
 	
 	
 		i have two i have uh in the system one is in ninth grade and one is in seventh grade and them um i'm home schooling my kindergartner this year
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		we um  live in a district that has open classrooms and i wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her
 	
 	
 		yep are you in Plano yep i am too and i have one in ninth grade at Clark and one at Hendrick this year and he my ninth my uh sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews
 	
 	
 		yes you too
 	
 	
 		and the very first year i taught back in seventy three we had open classroom and it didn't work then and when we moved down here i was just appalled that they were still doing it here
 	
 	
 		oh
 		still at it
 		well the explanation i was was given about you know they they seemed to admit that it wasn't working but they didn't have the money to restructure but looks to me that it wouldn't take
 		really that much money to at least come up with i mean some kind of partitions you know
 	
 	
 		partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something
 	
 	
 		just yeah
 	
 	
 		i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school so he spent all day in this one large open area
 	
 	
 		oh goodness
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i didn't really care for that it seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here
 	
 	
 		were they
 	
 	
 		that was our last tour up in Michigan
 	
 	
 		well we were from North um Carolina and of course North North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education i think they rank about forty ninth but our children got a very good education there they were in the magnet school program
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a lot of their classes from the time they were about third grade they they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and it was wonderful so you know i'm coming to to Plano thinking well gosh it's going to be really great it's ranked so much better
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes that's right we heard wonderful things about it till we actually got in the system
 	
 	
 		isn't that interesting i i i don't understand how they get this this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money i don't know
 	
 	
 		probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are
 	
 	
 		i guess so well my son is at Clark this year too so uh we're yes
 	
 	
 		so
 		as a freshman yep
 	
 	
 		and uh he's pleased with his classes um i i don't guess i've been in the high school long enough to to know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what to expect really you know how to judge it uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my daughter seems to be having a good time she was absent with strep throat the last three days and i ran over and picked up her report card and she did very good so
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of homework i would expect
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for a freshman to have she's not bogged down but yet she has some every night
 	
 	
 		well Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any so that's interesting but he his grades i haven't seen them yet but supposedly they're good so
 	
 	
 		yes you always hear how good now my son's at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but who knows what he's going to bring home so i don't
 	
 	
 		that's right
