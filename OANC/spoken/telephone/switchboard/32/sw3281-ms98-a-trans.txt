 
     		
 	
 		okay Diane and a very good afternoon to you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and afternoon good afternoon to you
 	
 	
 		do you uh do most of your cooking at home or do you uh have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um no i do most of my cooking at home and um i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party
 	
 	
 		ah my goodness  well what would you uh like to cook what's what what what is your favorite uh recipes uh that you would like to have for a dinner party now you're in Dallas is it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		
 
 		uh right i'm in Dallas of course um dinner parties down here probably
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		oh turn out to be more things like barbecues  and
 	
 	
 		i was i was thinking in terms of Mexican almost Tex-Mex Tex-Mex
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes yeah uh Tex-Mex Tex-Mex uh Mexican food um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		probably a little bit different than what you serve up in Pennsylvania for a dinner party
 	
 	
 		well that's a very interesting food though and when i go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods i like to find we have uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think  Chico's or or these different restaurants in this area that uh have all those fine Mexican foods but um if i were to cook uh a dinner party
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it may be standard to you but uh actually i never get too much fried chicken
 	
 	
 		fried chicken
 	
 	
 		but i would have fried chicken um  with reasonably hot sauce on it almost a Mexican type thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i love twice cooked potatoes have you ever had twice cooked potatoes
 	
 	
 		oh yes i have
 	
 	
 		with with the cream made of the the sour cream and cream cheese and uh little oleo and i use uh
 		oregano and maybe dill weed on mixed in with it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i like broccoli casseroles
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which would include onion and cheese and again more dill weed and some medium hot peppers as you can see i'm inclined towards the Mexican type of a meal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so  uh how would you improve upon that
 	
 	
 		improve upon that let's see
 		i'd probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in
 	
 	
 		more fresh vegetables included to that
 	
 	
 		and some  yeah
 		uh green beans and um carrots and things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		how do you cook your green beans
 	
 	
 		my green beans um i just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		so you
 	
 	
 		and i like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them
 	
 	
 		all right that's what i was wondering about what what you use and and and  herbs and so forth
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right uh-huh um i like to just put
 		a tablespoon or so of Mrs Dash in there and it makes them pretty tasty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		have you ever tried Chinese type green beans
 	
 	
 		the Chinese type are they the real
 	
 	
 		we use soy sauce
 	
 	
 		no i haven't ever used that
 	
 	
 		well you might uh be interested in that have it gives a very delicious taste you you have a soy sauce taste and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the water and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		golly what's this white powder that that uh
 		that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce and i can't even think of the name of that right at the moment
 	
 	
 		a white powder
 		um
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		anyhow sorry about my mind but uh it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans and then you have the nice soy sauce taste under it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with a few onions in there with it it does it it brings out such a so much different things in uh in the string beans
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like i like it to try them differently i hardly ever cook them the same way twice
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just so i can enjoy them
 		so you might uh think about that Chinese
 	
 	
 		yeah i might try that
 	
 	
 		Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them
 	
 	
 		oh yes i love Chinese
 	
 	
 		and uh north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous
 	
 	
 		North African
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's uh made from uh semolina i think they call it beans
 		and that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous
 		uh absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it with it makes a very delicious dish you probably probably have to buy that from specialty stores
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		C O U S C O U S and that's a a north African dish they eat it one to two meals every day in North Africa
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and it is very very flexible you can do a lot of things with it makes a fantastic uh
 		uh salad
 		with cucumbers and olive oil and onions and oh boy real tasty
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well i've enjoyed talking with you and i hope i've given you some ideas and uh
 	
 	
 		well i've enjoyed talking with you
 	
 	
 		that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		well thank you very much Miss Diane
