 
     		
 	
 		well the types of vacations that i usually take i usually come back more tired after my vacation then i do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know before i take it um i need to definitely take a vacation where all all i do is rest and i i guess to do that i'd probably have to take it at home
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but um the vacation spots that i like to go to are places like the Bahamas and Florida i enjoy the beach
 	
 	
 		okay  i am after our last summer's vacation i am antibeach  uh-huh we went to uh Cape Hatteras
 	
 	
 		antibeach
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well we we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland then we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days and uh uh the the waves were huge i've never quite seen waves like this one  and uh i was standing in water not more than
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in just barely above my ankles and uh you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles and i was standing there talking to my daughter and this really big wave came and totally threw me and one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		foot did not come out of the sand and it tore the ligaments in my knee so i'm never going to another beach again  i'm a more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you might be like i am i enjoy i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas but i really don't like to get into water the water the ocean i prefer a swimming pool
 	
 	
 		well i I love to go and play around at least i always did but although actually my i like the mountains i uh i don't really like hot weather that's my biggest gripe about living here and i basically
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		don't wanna go to a hot place on vacation  um i my dream vacation is Alaska
 	
 	
 		right i can understand that
 		uh-huh that would be nice
 	
 	
 		this is just someplace i've always wanted to go and someday i hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i know i've taken several vacations to Colorado and i used to live in Colorado oh sometime ago for a couple of years and i really enjoyed that
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i'd i'd like that uh i haven't been to Yellowstone for a long long time and i would uh we've been talking about going there next summer  uh i don't know we'll have to to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah  i've never been up to the Yellowstone area so
 	
 	
 		it's been a long time but you know it seems when your family is is different places
 		a lot of trips involved going to visit
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right you got that
 	
 	
 		oh i'm we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and i are both from and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we've got one of our our kids lives out on the East Coast and so we have to you know go to those
 	
 	
 		well you have you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then right
 	
 	
 		well i know but i'm tired of them i wanna go someplace different  up there uh my my idea i guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with uh money be no object
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know so just absolutely you know first class fly where i want to rent a car if i want to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know just really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says well let's take this little side trip you know and not have to sit there and figure out um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know can we we fit that in there or now that uh that that's what i um
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yes that's what i would like to do i have no interest for example in taking a cruise to me why anybody wanna ride around on a boat for a few days is  mind boggling
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it would be sort of confining i feel like it would be confining
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i would rather much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i just uh that that does absolutely nothing for me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know i can say that i think my my favorite spots are still to go to go where there's mountains and and lot of trees and and wildlife to view and and uh
 		i like that kind of stuff i could just sit there all day and look at the scenery
 	
 	
 		yes i i agree i can i can do that too and um you know i think if i had if i had the money i would probably go to Europe every year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because of you know i think that they have they have it all over there in just a a few tiny two two miles you know there's mountains and there's beaches and  it's all right there so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		yeah uh i i guess i've never really thought about it that way
 		our uh  we have our daughter who's almost thirteen but she's uh a very picky eater and our our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know gee Holly would starve to death if we you know we took her to another country so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i i would like if you know it was anywhere in the world to go i guess even though it's hot i would like to go to Africa
