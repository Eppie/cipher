 		well  i guess a lot of the uh something that's kind of more of a comedy  we do have uh cable and we have premium stations like HBO and Showtime and such and
 		i guess a lot of times when i first turn the TV on i i normally go to those because i pay for them i'm like i guess i want to see if there's anything i really want to see there so i don't end up watching the um
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		prime time on some of the standard channels as much i i tend to go to my premium channels first
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh well we have cable but we only have Cinemax and uh i think our favorite night is uh Monday night and we start out with Evening Shade
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and Major Dad and i think that's the one night that we really try to watch television you know my husband's always got it on i'm not always sitting down at it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yeah
 		Monday night's pretty good with Murphy Brown and Designing Women
 	
 	
 		yes yes yes i just i love that all those that that two hours and uh now tonight i just finished up with that A Woman Called Jackie did you watch did you watch it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		we had watched it uh i guess Sunday night and Monday night but we didn't get to watch it tonight
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it was pretty good it uh sometimes i like a dramatization and i like uh USA when they have their uh  uh mystery movies and things their made for TV movies
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i like those and we very seldom watch any uh Public Television channel thirteen do you watch it much
 	
 	
 		the only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights starting fairly late like i'm talking ten o'clock and maybe till midnight they have some British comedy
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that we've we've really liked a there's a variety some of them is uh Black Adder or Good Neighbors or Yes Prime Minister and Are You Being Served they they rotate those around
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and um we like that British comedy British comedy is very fast you really have to listen but
 	
 	
 		yes it is now we haven't watched any of those
 	
 	
 		they're real good but they do come on kind of late but we really do enjoy those sometimes we get to watching some stuff on Discovery Channel
 	
 	
 		yes now we have watched some things on that
 	
 	
 		and i'm amazed sometimes what i see on there  but i'm very intrigued i one time i was watching a operation and i thought gee i i don't believe i'm watching this
 	
 	
 		yeah we had uh i don't know my husband loves to uh
 		that male syndrome of flicking that channel thing you know and he's flipping around there and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and he went by and he said whoops and he  backed up and you know there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner  you know and and i'm saying let's move right on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		but our grandchildren like that Discovery Channel if they're over here because lots of times they will have things on uh animals and they just thoroughly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know enjoy that in fact i think they were watching something on uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		whales or killer sharks sharks one or the other  couple of weeks ago over here and uh so we have watched that and uh  otherwise  of course my husband's into the football
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you know i will watch that some if i'm reading or doing something else you know with him and uh but other
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i'm not into watching sports now my husband likes to watch football

 		he's not really into uh baseball or basketball too much but uh football soon as it's fall then he likes to watch college on Saturday and then of course Cowboys on Sunday
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 		yes and sometimes now we're getting it that uh the other football where they play it
 		inside and you know i'm hollering this is a you know this is too much
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Saturdays and Sundays this is fine but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring  you know all of that and uh but he will uh he'll flip around i think the other night we had on uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh it was a it was car races some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down i don't know what channel he found that on
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh but he will turn that on especially for if again if our uh oldest grandson is over here he's ten and uh they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it i you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i keep telling him it's the same mentality there you know something's wrong  and uh but uh and we very seldom watch television on a Friday night or Saturday night because we're not home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh so and Sundays uh we usually have all of our kids are over on Sunday so you know we don't get into that except that sometimes we'll get into the home videos
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		do you ever watch that
 	
 	
 		yeah the you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff yeah those are pretty good  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		that are sometimes so dumb
 	
 	
 		but true to life i mean some of the those
 	
 	
 		but very true to life i mean i've seen our family in several of those situations
