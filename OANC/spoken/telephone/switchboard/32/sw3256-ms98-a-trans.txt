 
     		
 	
 		well i did hear the end of the prompt this time was that you that we didn't hear the whole prompt and it said that what what do we do we think that crime certain crimes should fit certain punishments
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		and uh i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that that i really you know wish that there was some way
 		to uh send a message to people you know about um child abuse and things like that that uh those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment too often i feel that people get off uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		without
 	
 	
 		yeah i i agree with you although i will say i'm not sure you know i sometimes have a problem with some of the especially more famous people
 		who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have you know was was because they were abused abused abused as children and the parents are saying hey wait a minute we didn't do anything like that you know and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and
 		i guess before i'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it  it has to be a an absolute certainty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know like uh  caught at it or something you know or if they they uh you know severely beat up on a child or you know i would have absolutely no problem at all
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know with with i don't buy the routine oh they're just sick or they were abused when they were little well well you know forget that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well sometimes they even wonder when when uh criminals plead temporary insanity
 		for for punishment for crimes that are so severe and then you know they get sent to a mental institution and they play loony for a while and then they're back out in public
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well but i can't see that either i don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent again uh you know reason to not use capital punishment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah oh i agree i agree because we
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i think uh  i think if i wanted to badly enough i could convince somebody
 		uh i was crazy  so my family may say that on occasion who knows  you know uh i i don't think it's that hard to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know to to convince somebody that uh gee you just had no control over what you were doing
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well and too you know they can always be blaming the other person well she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child or something which i think is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse i guess you know a lot of and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's the new one
 	
 	
 		is that the new i just happened to see the headline on it and i didn't couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what but i thought uh
 		you know if these things if children are being abused i i'm wondering how our school system is failing that they're not even seeing this
 		you know if it was that severe that when they're later in life adults that it's all of a sudden affecting them in this way that it wasn't shown up at all when they were younger
 		and that kind of that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having you know to to deal with that yet but still
 	
 	
 		well you you're right uh and yet i mean did you ever in your life when you were little know  anybody or hear anything of anything like this no
 	
 	
 		never and i lived in California which i feel like California you know anything can go on in California
 	
 	
 		oh well
 		yes well yes i but i was from conservative Wisconsin  and uh you know there was there was nothing on it which makes me wonder you know if it's as uh prevalent as as some of them claim
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it uh it it it's
 		you just don't know and it all unless they're caught in the act or the the the child is very badly you know beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know that type thing now Texas is capital punishment for it used to be just capital murder and now they they added mass murder are those the only two things that we uh
 	
 	
 		i really would have no idea
 		i uh i don't don't really know
 	
 	
 		uh you know because i have a feeling it is and i i think there ought to be more things added to it uh if you
 	
 	
 		um-hum that would be pretty lenient in my opinion
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think that's i you know uh killing a child uh kidnapping
 		uh and possibly not well
 		i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt you know if they release them two hours later he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that or like when uh i've heard when i
