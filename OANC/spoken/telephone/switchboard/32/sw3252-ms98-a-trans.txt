 
     		
 	
 		sure i have a Springer Spaniel and her name is Thumper she's about seven or eight years old
 	
 	
 		okay do you have any
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i got her for Christmas from my family and uh back when we lived in Nebraska i like to hunt and uh so
 		i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like Thumper that boy i could just go out and get all kinds of game  yeah except we live in Plano Texas now so
 	
 	
 		did it work
 		no right i um i had a for many years i had a dog that was part Springer Spaniel i just love them
 		her name was Molly but she isn't alive anymore  we had her for hm fifteen years i think my family did and just
 		loved her she was the greatest greatest um went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle
 	
 	
 		do you have a pet now
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a cat now he just turned seven also  and he's i um got him in Arizona  and when i used to live there and he is huge he is eighteen pounds
 	
 	
 		oh
 		what kind of cat is it
 	
 	
 		just um i got him he was um he was born in the wild like in a in a shed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and had never been in a building when i got him so he and he's he he must be part cross part with some kind of desert animal because he's very long and lanky but he's a very tame spoiled house cat you know now that i've had him for seven years
 	
 	
 		being born outside you didn't have any problems house training them
 	
 	
 		no no  he's yeah he's great and uh he's uh he's really spoiled though  so but he's
 	
 	
 		that's good
 		
 
 	
 	
 		really big so lots of times he it he seems to get in fights and when he was younger i think he started them and now i think he barely makes it i think he gets beat up even though he's big because he's
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		pretty much overweight and comes home with a few scratches now and then yeah
 	
 	
 		and older
 		well we went to a uh cat show at the Plano Center here in town and uh we thought that we have a cat now but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know we'd want something kind of unique so
 		we kind of looked around and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats and we sort of fell in love with the uh Maine Coon cats
 	
 	
 		oh i've seen them i
 	
 	
 		they're huge
 	
 	
 		yeah  i have seen them they um weren't they they were actually i can't remember they were used to be used on ships
 		and in for  for mousers you know so they're very nautical too
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i'll be darned i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		yeah i just uh i think i'm i think i'm being accurate in the in the area of folklore but i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting we kind of like well my family didn't necessarily like like them as much as i did but the Manx is that the one that doesn't have a tail it sort of has a bob tail i kind of like that too but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah i'd love to go to a cat show i'm real like a real cat lover i'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let us let me  he doesn't really like mine let alone another one so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog and then i suppose our five minutes will be up huh i uh
 	
 	
 		yeah okay
 	
 	
 		work for a university and i went to uh Omaha Nebraska to recruit students and i had some time off in the afternoon so i went to a a pet shop
 		and i saw these little Springer Spaniels and so i decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have so when i got back home to Carney Nebraska
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i told my wife about it and i said you know this is just a i i i can just hear the dog crying for me now  and and Christmas is coming up hint hint and so
 	
 	
 		i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university and one of the people uh that we went with uh they were friends of ours and so
 		we uh got to Omaha and i decided i'd take my friend over and show him the dog and
 		so i got over there and she said oh that's too bad the dog has already been sold and i didn't realize it but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog and she was in the back room
 		and uh so that night we had a reception for some of the uh potential high school students or college students and
 		and uh he had the dog the whole time in his room and and i had no idea and so we headed back to Carney that night and
 		the dog rode in the car and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the dog in the car and i guess while we were inside eating
 		Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside  of the car and uh finally we made it back to uh to Carney and
