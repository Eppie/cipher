 
     		
 	
 		why don't you go ahead and say what you feel and then i'll respond
 	
 	
 		all right well i'm uh i'm very guilty of of not doing my part with recycling i'm afraid we um recently moved here from North Carolina and
 		they had curbside recycling and it was very easy
 		
  
 		put everything out there but we don't have it in at least in our neighborhood right now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so i've been very guilty about not making the effort to to take things where they belong
 	
 	
 		well how long have you been here
 	
 	
 		well we've been here since January  so we we still feel very new but i it's working up to a year now so  i guess we're old-timers compared to some people
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah i think that's a good excuse you need to get into the  the system a little more and know where to take things
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've been here probably two and a half years and
 		and we didn't recycle at all before we came so i think we're doing well we we've saved most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		where do you take those things
 	
 	
 		well the um glass and the newspaper we usually take to Wal-Mart
 		they have um in behind Wal-Mart they have bins
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then we usually save up our cans and and change them in for money
 	
 	
 		where do you do that because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir um but i didn't know where to take them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um there's a place on Parker Road um it's just over the overpass before you get like to KMart i think there's a a service station there there's usually a semi truck
 		that has a a person there that will weigh them and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		now they aren't worth much right now but  it's better than nothing so and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		better than nothing right
 	
 	
 		what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now and we hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October
 	
 	
 		yeah i it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that you know it's coming in a couple of months but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah and  i think it's been delayed i think it was originally scheduled for February but the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		from what i've read in you know the mail that we get and i can't wait for that that will be easy i get tired of newspaper littering the garage
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah it gets to be a bit much before  haul it off but
 	
 	
 		i feel guilty we don't recycle our our milk containers because they seem like a big waste
 	
 	
 		well they do yeah they they're a lot of bulk anyway and yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah they fill up the whole kitchen garbage pail so i'll be glad when the bins do come and i think that's when i'll i'll start doing the plastic too
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah it was real easy with the bins it really was and it was it was just no effort at all um no more trouble than taking out the garbage so um i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i've gotten used to washing the you know the um salad dressing bottles and things like that it's not that big of a deal i mean it's nicer to just throw them out but we can do our part take an extra minute or two
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah
 		well how much do you earn on the cans i i didn't know how what kind of an idea to give her for
 	
 	
 		oh when we first were were here it was like we'd take maybe a oh a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full and it'd be like two dollars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar
 	
 	
 		so it's gone down yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah which is understandable i think more people are are recycling but  that's something that we we don't really make any effort to
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		and whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter you know the the cans and that was kind of fun but we haven't done that for a long time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well that sounds like a pretty good project well
 	
 	
 		well the boys think it's fun plus you get your exercise and you  you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest so but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh  well i'll i'll have to kick myself and and get get on it my neighbor across the street um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is so careful about  recycling and so i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		keep telling myself i'll i'll get it organized but maybe maybe they'll beat me and and do the city wide first and
 	
 	
 		well hopefully the bins will be here in this month and that will spur you on so  all right well it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting so
 	
 	
 		right right i don't have any excuse then that's for sure
 		thinking about it anyway yeah but  well um have you do they time this thing for us or do we
 	
 	
 		yeah trying  that's all you can do so that
 		um yeah you can do it as long as you want they you know if it's been long enough five minutes is is when they cut in and say
 		say we don't have anymore room for recording so so we can say good-bye now it was good talking to you and maybe we'll get on line again  thanks Sherry bye-bye
 	
 	
 		you can't you can't chat all day huh  okay
 		okay bye-bye
