 
     		
 	
 		hobbies do you have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i i do i play tennis and softball and i do a little bit of woodworking around the house furniture stripping and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		ah
 		do you do antiques
 	
 	
 		uh well i have this uh huge kitchen cabinet that uh it was like an old cabinet my buildings from was built in nineteen oh four
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i have this cabinet that had about eight layers of paint on it and i stripped it down and i'm still working on it for about it's been about a year that i've been working on it
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		it's beautiful moldings and a beautiful cabinet and as soon as i'm done with it it should be good
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		we use like a heat gun to strip it and then uh chemicals to get the rest of the paint out of the crevices and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		do you do all this in your house
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's it's it's uh it's probably movable the cabinet but it would be tough to move i was able to take some of the pieces apart it's like a kitchen pantry basically
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i was able to take some of the pieces apart like some of the shelves out to clean them out independently and stuff
 	
 	
 		boy that's an ambitious project
 	
 	
 		yeah a little too ambitious
 	
 	
 		had you ever done any refinishing before
 	
 	
 		no i'd done nothing like it before but a neighbor of ours had done this and it looked uh looked nice so we figured we'd try it ourselves
 	
 	
 		oh
 		so the neighbor was able to give you guidance
 	
 	
 		um a little bit she didn't tell us she did say it was gonna be hard work  she was right she was right
 	
 	
 		yeah  and she was right
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so uh what kind of work do you do you do any  you do anything like that or what are your hobbies
 	
 	
 		well uh i do a lot of needlework
 		and i also do puzzles for magazines i get paid for this i've written two puzzle books
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and so in my free time even though it's not a hobby and that i do get paid for it i'm always developing new puzzles and activities and and word games mind benders that type of thing
 	
 	
 		crossword you do crossword puzzles mostly or or
 	
 	
 		no they're they're variety type puzzles
 		uh not crosswords just all different kinds find the hidden word and um you know anagram type puzzles acrostic cryptograms
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh  mostly for children but some of them go up through grade twelve
 		so and i've developed a lot of my own type of puzzles like word snakes and grid graphs and things like that so that's what published so  if i have free time i'm usually sitting down with uh graph paper doing some puzzles
 	
 	
 		is that what you do for a living or you do other things
 	
 	
 		i'm a writer for a living i writer other things i'm a freelance writer
 	
 	
 		huh grand
 		fantastic
 	
 	
 		and uh i was a teacher for fourteen years and i'm not teaching because we've had to move around so much that i
 	
 	
 		are you from Texas
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i i live in Texas now but i'm from Southern Ohio originally
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh we've lived in Michigan and it seems like wherever i go i need to take forty hours of college in order to update my teaching credentials
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i decided i didn't want that to be my hobby any more after paying thousands and then moving the next year so um now i'm i'm just writing at home
 	
 	
 		well you have yeah you have a good career for that crossword puzzles and writing you don't have to go out my wife's my wife's an editor and we just had our first child so she's
