 
     		
 	
 		one of the hardest things in finding child care is deciding to let go what do you think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now what do you mean by letting go
 	
 	
 		well like going back to work and uh it seems like parents have a very difficult time especially mothers have a very difficult time in uh
 		finding someone well first off in going back to work they uh with the little babies and then then finding someone that satisfies them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right right well um gosh my kids are older now so i feel like that that my uh choices are are different now when i first
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes
 	
 	
 		when i first went back to work uh you're right i i wanted to have somebody who came into the house and who performed you know certain functions and that closeness and i noticed that as the older they got
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know the less and less picky i got about that um uh that criteria
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but you know now uh you know i wish there was somebody not so much to babysit the kids but tutor them in homework  really really so but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and help help with the housework a little bit
 		the the best one i ever had was uh when i had only one child and
 		uh was an infant and it was an older woman and she came to the house and uh she had noon meal cooked and my husband and i came home and ate and everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh see that would've been wonderful
 	
 	
 		well of course it was extra special for us because he was a student and i had to work so uh that really helped
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		oh yeah yeah yeah those uh those people who can uh stay you know home and and take care of the kids and uh you know do that i think are really special people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um so you just don't find that anymore um even now the the day cares though are so expensive
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		that um i don't know how parents afford them uh
 	
 	
 		i don't either well a lot of mothers have had to quit work because of that
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		you get one or two children one child and could be fifty to seventy five dollars a week
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i
 	
 	
 		and then you get two and it just multiplies
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i i think it's gone up to like a hundred dollars a week and depending on on what age they are
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know if you want quality day care to where they have uh not only just their meals taken care of those basic necessities but also uh their education too
 	
 	
 		that's true study time and uh if they watch television it's educational only or you know monitor that don't just turn them loose on it
 	
 	
 		um-hum because
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah oh yeah so it's a i i think it's changed over the years
 		um but you know i found uh like i said they at least when my kids were growing up that uh it was harder especially companies didn't have programs to where they would help you find babysitters yeah
 	
 	
 		oh no huh-uh
 		you found someone in the neighborhood if you were lucky yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum  that's right that's right and  um-hum
 	
 	
 		it
 		have you had any experience with people who have chosen nannies
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no no but you know i've read um you know some stories uh about that and uh so now now i don't do you know of anybody
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i'm i do the kind kind of work we
 		we do medical checkups on some who are going to be nannies and the criteria they're using are they want they they require them to have certain blood tests and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		as well as their educational requirements and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the one nannies i've talked to who bring the children in are very very uh
 		oh enthusiastic about what they're doing with them and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um they present themselves well but that's as as close as i've come to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah no i had just you know read in a uh oh i don't know the the want columns um but i guess when i had thought about it since i've been a single parent for so long that uh you know i wished i had the money for something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		because of the special um
 		oh i don't know the um the special closeness that bond that's formed versus taking them to a day care where they just they're one of many children
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah so that's a that's to me it's extra special
 	
 	
 		well the only i think the one good thing about day care of course i'm in the grandchildren age and one of my grandchildren needed the day care because he needed to the other
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh other uh younger children he needed to learn to share
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		he was uh his mother couldn't get two feet from him
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and uh they're hoping that that helps on that course that may be just the age
 	
 	
 		yeah it it could be age but you know i i can never regwet regret uh the children
 		uh going through that day care experience because they learned so many things uh such as responsibility independence
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know that sharing i mean there are a lot of good things i i know there's a lot of drawbacks to women going back to to work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um i think there was so many positives that that i saw
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um that i i really didn't have that much guilt about it
 	
 	
 		well good good course what really helps is when you know you have to right
 	
 	
 		yeah that made it real easy  but i i
