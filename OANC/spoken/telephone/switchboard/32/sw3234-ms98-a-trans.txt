 		oh
 	
 	
 		what do you have
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society
 	
 	
 		uh you know those make the best animals uh pets best pets
 		my uh son has a uh oh it's a real mixture it's part uh
 		Doberman and part Husky
 		yes and they gentlest dog you ever met and they got him from the uh Humane Society here in Oklahoma City
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and she's just turned out to be a jewel
 		my my little Schnauzer is is my friend she is so spoiled she's a year and a half old now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and being single
 		she's become very important in my life
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's so nice to have come home and find something or someone who's really so happy to see you
 	
 	
 		well my children are the ones that wanted our pet and this one is probably the best one that we have had
 		um as i say we got it from the Humane Society and uh we had lost a pet and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost it got out under the fence while we were on vacation and
 		we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it but uh when we walked in to the
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to the Humane Society this little dog was uh in the office and would sit up and beg and just oh he was so cute and the kids just fell in love with it we just couldn't leave without it
 		but it's um whoever had it before must have trained it real well
 		because it's just you know it's uh a good house dog
 		i've never had one that i could keep in the house before and tolerate it
 	
 	
 		sometimes i wish i had not gotten this one as a puppy
 		because i work and i'm not home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and unfortunately she's not as well trained as
 		as i would like her to be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i realize it's my fault i'm not
 		doing a really great job as a disciplinarian
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		it's hard to do that when you're not there constantly
 	
 	
 		it is it is she's you know
 		she's real good i can leave her all day in the bathroom
 		with her toys and her food and everything and and not one mess does she make and then we go outside
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and she'll stay outside for oh thirty minutes to an hour
 		come inside and use the restroom
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i just want to kill her at those times
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but she's a doll she's a love she really is
 	
 	
 		about the only time we have well i shouldn't say the only time but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night
 		and uh she usually stays inside at night we try to take her out right before we go to sleep
 		but uh sometimes it doesn't work
 	
 	
 		you know i i
 		we always had a pet when i was growing up oh always had a dog my mother did not like cats
 		so we always had a dog and and then course when my children were growing up we always had a dog and always said it's because
 		the children wanted the pet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i find that i'm enjoying this one far more than i ever did when it was the children's dog
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i uh in fact my children gave me this this little puppy for Christmas
 	
 	
 		what a cute idea
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		well we got one one year for Christmas and uh i had a baby the next day
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so  that one wasn't really well trained
 	
 	
 		two babies huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		oh i just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time so
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that
 		that is really probably
 		bad timing
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it was it really was The older kids had wanted one though and you know we thought well that would be a fun time for them to have it you know get it at Christmas time it was a little Spitz with a little white
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		fluffy and you know looked like it came right from the North Pole
 		and that was fun but um i I sure wasn't good at training it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you
 	
 	
 		i think you have to have time you know to to do those things
 	
 	
 		and patience and you have to
 		you really have to be just like your children
 		when you set a rule you have to stand by it
 		and be consistent
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and
