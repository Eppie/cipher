 
     		
 	
 		okay i don't  do you have a opinion on that on the USR
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well  the  i think i'm i'm skeptical about the whole thing uh and a little still a little bit worried about them because of the history the history of Russia
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they're in a in a state of flux right now changing uh you uh changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress
 	
 	
 		sure
 		um-hum sure
 	
 	
 		and even in that situation uh the it seems like to me from what i've read in in the history of Russia and and you know different authors
 		uh there has always been a paranoia they've always suspected everybody and and that's why they put you know that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years and that's why they put a lot of people to death
 	
 	
 		sure
 		sure that happens
 	
 	
 		yeah Stalin Staling was a was a classical example i guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more Russians than uh you know the Russian army killed anybody else
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure i guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot
 		go into a war uh they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together but i could not foresee them  severing what they have with the US
 		um because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation um from what i've been hearing is the USSR uh USSR has been uh almost bankrupt
 		for years and it's people are desperate and there might be a revolution within the people  but i don't think the US would get involved with it because uh there's too close of ties to where
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change and that we cannot run
 		them like we run the US and that they have to make their own independent decision so i guess i really have no fear at all of the USSR verses uh you get these small little uh places like Iraq and all of that that
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		might be something that i'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons versus a a small
 		uh or the big country of USSR i i i have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would
 		totally  you know it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i mean sure they have weapons to kill us over and over and over but
 		to them that would be a suicide and they and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people but if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of
 		you know doing whatever uh for their country they'll do it uh
 	
 	
 		yeah you're uh i think you're right there's a little more craziness down there
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh the Russian people i think are not that much different from us you know i think they're that it would be the leadership that i'd i'd uh mistrust
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 		um-hum  sure i have a daughter that's frustrated she's on a a stool that she can get up on but it if she can't get down on it it's like get me down right now  but anyway it was really good talking to you and you have a good weekend
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		you to thank you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		uh-huh thank you bye now
