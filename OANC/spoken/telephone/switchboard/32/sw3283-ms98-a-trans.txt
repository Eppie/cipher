 
     		
 	
 		okay we're talking about capital punishment
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		how do you feel about that Lenore
 	
 	
 		i am very much for capital punishment
 	
 	
 		well wonderful i am too one hundred percent
 	
 	
 		my dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus and i've been raised around
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		prison
 		prisons all my life and i believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime there's not any deterrent
 	
 	
 		all your life huh uh-huh
 		there's no deterrent
 		that's right there's just no deterrent
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and so many of those kind of people uh they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway so you know unless they really make it rough on them that's not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think
 	
 	
 		especially not a federal prison
 	
 	
 		right well i don't know what the Oklahoma's laws are but Texas is i don't know our
 		i don't know it's it's no ones fault i mean it's not the judges fault i don't think it's just the way the law is down here
 		man our crimes our uh prisons are so crowded that uh they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two
 	
 	
 		well see we were under uh the state prisons were under a mandate to
 		uh it was over crowded and the federal came in and said hey you know you have either got to build more prisons or let people go
 	
 	
 		well that's what ours did same thing
 	
 	
 		and finally our governor at the time which who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let
 		loose under early bail you know or early uh  out but uh we have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		the death penalty is not given often
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but there have been
 	
 	
 		it's not here either really
 	
 	
 		and you know i maybe it should be
 		uh
 		well it should be given you know i i won't say sparingly but i do believe it should be befitting the crime
 	
 	
 		i do too and and you know but the way the courts are set up they've they've got so many chances for appeal but i think that i think it needs to be expedited you know if they've been convicted and given them appeal
 		and they're still convicted of of a crime that's deserving of of a lethal injection let's do it and not waste so many years to do it
 	
 	
 		right course you know they're they're entitled to a speedy trial
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but then they're they're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals so somehow you know it doesn't really balance out too much
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah
 		that's right somehow it just doesn't it works and then again it takes too long for it to work
 	
 	
 		and it seems even though you know that they got the prisoner himself can come to the point that hey i'm tired i just want out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i'm tired of fighting it then the system just keeps on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and at that point you know i i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter
 	
 	
 		yeah it it was
 	
 	
 		appeal process
 	
 	
 		i do too i think that needs to and i don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably but you know
 	
 	
 		well part of that is the overcrowding of the court system
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true it is overcrowded because there's so much drug uh
 		problem with the people on drugs because that they with the drugs they're they're robbing and killing and uh that's why it's filled the prisons up so much i think
 	
 	
 		uh it doesn't it doesn't help them any at all and course your court system when you get into the appeals
 	
 	
 		no it doesn't
 	
 	
 		i don't believe criminal is in a court by itself
 		and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true with all these lawsuits and people suing people over things ridiculous things but
 	
 	
 		we've gotten into a very litigious uh type of life
 	
 	
 		boy haven't that we though we really have but anyway i'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the  capital punishment i'm i'm very muchly for it always have been always will be
 	
 	
 		well i just
 		i just feel like their
 		crime and punishment and
 		if if you don't have the punishment
 		you double your crime and that you know that is just personal feeling it's not going on facts
 		i think the facts would probably back it up but
 	
 	
 		it could be supportive it it's it's supported with facts though
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		it could very easily be  supported with facts
 	
 	
 		well yes i
