 		oh are you
 		oh i see well that's neat uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh do you work for TI uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i've worked for them for several years like twelve now i guess
 	
 	
 		oh you sound very young like just out of college
 	
 	
 		well i try to i try to think of myself as young but uh well have you seen any movies recently
 	
 	
 		uh i'm trying to think we saw uh Dances With Wolves and uh have you seen that one
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 		no i haven't i have i have a hard time with movies that are real long i don't know
 	
 	
 		that was excellent
 		well surprisingly enough i do too i get tired of sitting there and so does my husband but we both just thoroughly you know enjoyed it just really liked it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well i've heard a lot of good things about it
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm trying to think we went to see a uh
 		a real funny one i can't think now what the name of it was i've gone blank
 	
 	
 		was it
 		uh we my wife and i went and saw a couple of funny ones we saw the Naked Gun Two and a Half
 	
 	
 		oh we have not seen that we want to see that one
 	
 	
 		yeah that was that was pretty funny and then we saw
 		what was the spoof on Top Gun
 		it's
 	
 	
 		oh i haven't seen that one
 	
 	
 		oh i can't think of what it was called  we saw that too that i was pretty disappointed in that one  yeah but uh so you know through the summer we have small children so we don't get to see too many but we've seen i guess two or three movies this past summer
 	
 	
 		were you
 		my husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them he likes to rent them and so we watch a lot of them you know at home as they come out and uh yes yes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right have you seen Ghost yet
 		i really i enjoyed that movie
 	
 	
 		did you now i i was real disappointed i'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan and uh i was really disappointed in it it was one i don't think it was as funny as what i was anticipating anticipating and i guess i was expecting it to be kind of funny
 	
 	
 		really
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah now yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and it wasn't you know at all it was it was more of a love story and uh so i was really disappointed in that because i like him real well we just got through watching one with uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh is it Claude Van Damme
 	
 	
 		oh Van Damme yeah i think
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh enjoyed it i can't think of what the name of it was but it was a uh of course one of the typical you know kicking fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type move and and we enjoyed that and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		uh the one with Jodie Foster did you see it yes wasn't that excellent
 	
 	
 		oh Silence of the Lambs yes i did yeah i really enjoyed that a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah that was one that that stayed with me you know for a month i just i kept thinking about it you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well it's amazing but really i mean when you stop and think about it uh Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie and yet it was his character that was so intriguing
 	
 	
 		no
 		oh it was excellent and and of course he's such a uh very good actor anyway and i think he made the movie
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i do too i really do you know Jodie Foster was good too but i think i think Anthony Perkins was the one that that really made the movie i agree with you
 	
 	
 		you know
 		is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins Hopkins uh-huh i know i know it uh well i'm not a real big Jodie Foster fan but i thought she was good in that
 	
 	
 		oh Hopkins i'm sorry Hopkins yeah i always get those guys mixed up
 		well i i agree well i haven't been i'm i saw her in The Accused and i thought that was a pretty good movie i thought she
 	
 	
 		no now i didn't see that one
 	
 	
 		that was that was a pretty uh interesting movie and uh but you know i i did i really liked the Silence of the Lambs that was really intriguing and it it didn't scare me all that much you know and i i don't like to go to movies to be scared that's not why i go
 	
 	
 		no no i like a good suspenseful story and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats in fact i want to uh rent it when it comes out for my husband to see because he didn't he won't go see that no i went with uh our daughter
 	
 	
 		so
 		right and that one was
 		oh he didn't see it oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so you know saw it with her and uh enjoyed it my all time favorite is Weekend At Bernie's did you see it
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh really yeah i've seen it
 	
 	
 		oh i've seen it you know we saw it at the movies and then we've rented it several times and we just love it in fact we have a ten year old grandson that he and my husband and i we just sit there and cackle you know and just get hysterical
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh yeah i've seen that it's pretty it's pretty cute i guess you know as far as comedies go probably my favorite is Young Frankenstein i don't know i love that movie
 	
 	
 		uh yes yes my husband liked that
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		uh he's a big Gene Wilder fan
 	
 	
 		yeah well Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me but i'm a big uh Mel Brooks fan all his movies i really really enjoy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh he has a new one out and uh-huh uh i have seen it advertised i don't know what the name of it is
 	
 	
 		he does
 		oh is that the one with that's he's starring in oh yeah that came out like early in the summer or something i think yeah i haven't seen that one either it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yes yes
 		and my husband wants to see that one and uh did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the uh
 		the sheriff
 	
 	
 		oh Blazing Saddles yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Blazing Saddles oh that's my husband's all time favorite i think
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh i like i like that one too but i thought Young Frankenstein was better yeah that that was just you know had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie i just really enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		did you
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh um i'm trying to think because we saw another one that we thought was really good early this summer that was a suspenseful movie
