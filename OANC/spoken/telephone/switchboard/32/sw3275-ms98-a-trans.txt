 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so do you have an opinion on credit cards
 	
 	
 		um i do
 	
 	
 		you do
 	
 	
 		what do what do you think about them
 	
 	
 		i think they get a lot of people in trouble
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely i have one right now and
 		um i just got it about eight six months ago and i find that it it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah and then you don't stop to realize that you know you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you don't stop to think about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and then you know so i eventually got it all paid now i carry one i have a gas card and a Visa card and i never use them unless i need to
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's good yeah yeah i'd i made a rule with myself when i got one that if i couldn't pay it in full every month that i'd have to rip it up so
 	
 	
 		but they
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		stops all them interest rates and interest rates aren't
 		none too shallow these days anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 	
 	
 		but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially you know we have i'm in Lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech
 		and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot
 	
 	
 		um-hum i have i have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out  and they they can't do anything but work to try to pay them off and and and like one of my friends
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she does she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she's going to school
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and and so i mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty five dollars worth of food a month so and and pay for her like
 		like monthly fee like twenty yeah you have i guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the so all she's paying is interest on hers every month
 	
 	
 		yeah something like that
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it just seems crazy to
 		to me but
 	
 	
 		well my wife got in trouble one time with hers and
 		she was making like
 		i don't know what she was making forty five dollars a month i think
 		and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so and that was before we got married so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but it's you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and it's
 		it's come out pretty good now we have a
 		eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		that's the first thing he wanted
 	
 	
 		was it Visa card
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick
 	
 	
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		you know so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i don't know i'm about sick of mine right now
 		i don't
 	
 	
 		but i think they're too readily accessible and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you draft get you trapped i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but that's a lot of pain and hassle when
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and uh
 		we couldn't afford everything we didn't have such things as credit cards we just waited till time come around that we could afford it and you know we had all the necessities so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities i always use it for something i want not something i need
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah my parents are really good about
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		not using credit cards they are against it  i don't think they like the fact that i have one either
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think if credit cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldn't have the problems we have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		course we wouldn't have the retail market we have either so i guess they'd trade one for the other
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i disagree with it but they still trade one for the other
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hm
 	
 	
 		well that's good i'm it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for you sound pretty young so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm nineteen i'm twenty right now so just going to school and
 	
 	
 		are you yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and working so
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		it does kind of get in when you want something that like last weekend was homecoming and i needed a pair of shoes so i just went out and bought them and  on my credit card i didn't didn't have the money to do it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah it's pretty easy
 	
 	
 		yep
 		it sure is so do you just have two kids or
 	
 	
 		uh we have a eighteen year old a seventeen year old and a seven year old
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		neat
 		i'm from Plano Texas
 	
 	
 		oh are you
 	
 	
 		but right now i'm out in Provo Utah going to BYU so
 	
 	
 		are you a you're a Mormon then
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		all right
 	
 	
 		yep
 		but this is a extra long one
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		hey they're giving us a lot of time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they may not they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		have you done a lot of this
 	
 	
 		uh fifteen or twenty i guess
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		do you do it every day
 	
 	
 		i try to every day i uh i get calls at work i get calls at home so
