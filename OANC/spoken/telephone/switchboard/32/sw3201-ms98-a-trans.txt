 
     		
 	
 		so do you have any recycling programs there
 	
 	
 		um i don't really think we have anything
 		in the works as of yet uh we're pretty small town and um the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that show you know plastics
 		paper
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		liter bottles et cetera et cetera
 	
 	
 		we've progressed a little bit farther than that um actually they have uh parts of town
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it may have even spread all over the whole town and um they have these green bins
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's just as standard as a a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh just along with a trash can you have this this green plastic bin and you put your bottles in it and paper
 		and um you know all those things that  aluminum you know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh i guess you can also and a lot of the restaurants
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they just have uh places where you can throw away especially beer places
 		where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles and uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know i guess they're you know clear bottles so um you know a lot of people do have those separated
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and of course they have the um dumpsters uh the the igloos
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and they have those strategically strategically placed around the city
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh they're they're actually gonna extend it i think one of these days maybe to apartment complexes and uh
 	
 	
 		oh that'd be good
 	
 	
 		yeah things of that nature so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary
 	
 	
 		yeah see it's not anywhere near that uh we uh you know as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's as far as we go because i take them to a girl at work and she goes and cashes them in because you know i just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i can do that for her and and i don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really hm
 	
 	
 		yeah see we don't have anything here in Belton it's it's a pretty small little town
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember my grandparents and i used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so
 		yeah that's about all that that we're doing here uh they're
 		uh getting a little bit more on
 		they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle and what can you recycle and what you can't because
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know not a lot of people do  really know what you know
 	
 	
 		yeah they're doing a real good job of uh separating it here and of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper
 	
 	
 		what it's for
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it but uh they actually have the door to door pickup um and it's uh i think it started out to be um
 		just kind of a test a pilot project and it went over so well that they just extended it and it's almost uh i don't know if it's done by a private company or not it may be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh they just go around to each uh door and pick it up
 	
 	
 		wow that's excellent that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		let's see oh and every year of course the phone books
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um they tell everybody across the city to um put all their phone books in uh the uh recycle bins
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because you know phone books are pretty well for a bigger city they're pretty thick and and sometimes you might have two or three
 	
 	
 		yeah they uh
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		so uh that's that's a big savings right there in itself
 	
 	
 		yeah see ours just goes in the regular trash it just you know there's not a whole lot and there are you know some places that
 	
 	
 		yeah hm
 	
 	
 		we'll set up you know for old newspapers and stuff but usually it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it it hasn't caught on yet i'm hoping it will soon
 	
 	
 		um-hum well the thing about newspapers and paper recycled paper is actually very expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so when you see something that's on recycled paper they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that it's uh they're not coming out ahead at all
 		it's uh it's really a cost
 	
 	
 		hm  i wasn't totally aware of that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i mean it it sounds good to the public but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something now aluminum i don't know they may be coming out ahead
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i know for a fact that the paper
 		uh on that end they're not  you know it's it's good to recycle but it's uh not to their advantage and it costs less
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hm
 		well
 	
 	
 		i can't think of anything else okay
 	
 	
 		i can't either because we're we're at a very you know beginning stages so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we look forward to it to get better but that's it
 	
 	
 		well i hope y'all um uh come along a little farther in the future
 	
 	
 		yeah me too
 	
 	
 		it was nice talking to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		you too bye
