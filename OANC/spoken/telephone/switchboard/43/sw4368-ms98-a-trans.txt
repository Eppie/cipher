 
     		
 	
 		what do you do in terms of exercise if anything
 	
 	
 		
  
 		exercising exercising um i play wally uh wally ball are you familiar with that
 	
 	
 		no i'm not
 	
 	
 		i belong to a club uh uh near where i live or uh actually where i work uh in Salem New Hampshire and they uh it's on a racquet ball court and you set up a net and you play wally ball
 		it's just like volley ball but with some of the rules of racquet ball in that you can use the walls to help put the ball over or that type of thing
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		uh so it's it's kind of more fast paced than uh volley ball
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how many people play
 	
 	
 		uh you can play up to uh four or five on each side
 		which is quite a few people in such a small space
 	
 	
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		um uh but we usually play two and two
 		uh sometimes three uh three and three depending on how many people are willing to get up that early since we play before work
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh so we play that a couple of times a week and then i also play pick up games of basketball basketball in the mornings as well
 		so uh that's usually the extent of my exercise
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's kind of crazy
 	
 	
 		well
 		i take a an aerobics class three nights a week
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it's at the fitness center i actually work for an electronics company but we have a a fitness center
 		at there at the building
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and i take uh this aerobics class which is a great class it's what they call a circuit class where you do a few minutes of aerobic exercise and then you break and do some weight work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		with hand weights and then back to the aerobics and then maybe back to the elastic bands or whatnot but it's it's broken up for an hour
 	
 	
 		now are these is this what they call high impact or is this
 	
 	
 		no no this is low impact this is safe stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now is the high impact really that dangerous for you
 	
 	
 		i i think it is um i took a a high low impact class at the local Y a couple of years ago
 		and it just seemed like i was on the verge of getting hurt in terms of knees or back or something like that
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that that's amazing i'd taken some dance courses in in uh school and i don't know it
 		uh they seem like they would be classified as high impact but maybe there was more flow to it so it wasn't so jarring
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think the trouble with high impact aerobics is that it's so jarring and you don't with the low impact you always have one foot on the floor
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		you can get pretty strenuous doing that sort of stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well see that's the thing i see some of these people doing low impact and i'm like what's the difference  these people are really working up a sweat
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think it has to do with number of feet on the floor and how much bouncing around you do and that sort of thing like the class i'm in now does not do jumping jacks
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but we
 	
 	
 		cause both feet can't be on the floor at one time
 	
 	
 		right but but we certainly get our heart rates up
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		just from the the marching and and all that that we do so
 	
 	
 		which is i guess the whole point of it
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		now they you say do this at work
 	
 	
 		it it's at a fitness center that's associated with the company where i work yes
 	
 	
 		do you have to pay to do that or is it part of your benefits
 	
 	
 		uh no i have to pay to join
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh but it runs oh i think the class is
 		let's see i pay about ten dollars a month to be a member of this fitness
 		center
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and and there are all sorts of opportunities available there in term you know any anything from chess clubs to flying clubs  you think
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh then it's an extra forty dollars for an eight weeks aerobics class
 		and i think it's pretty competitive with most health most health centers and they they have a swimming pool and a gym and all kinds of
 	
 	
 		huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		of all kinds of the Nautilus equipment
 	
 	
 		i was going to say do they have the free weights circuit and the Nautilus circuit and all those things
 	
 	
 		yes i i did some of that
 		but it the time it takes is just
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		it uh i don't know once i i get through with the aerobics session i'm ready to go home and eat dinner or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you so you exercise in the evenings
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that's interesting uh i i don't know it my schedule i guess is more i get up at about uh five thirty and then i go and play wally ball from six thirty to say eight
 		and then i uh shave and shower and do that stuff uh at the gym and then i'm at work at eight thirty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's all kind of in the in the in the morning
 		but by the end by mid afternoon i'm like ugh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or depending on how the game went it could be like that right after uh right in the morning getting to work
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		so it it's interesting a different schedule um uh you don't feel more tired toward i guess well i guess you would
 		uh going home for dinner and then you're uh and then you're uh i i'm sure zonked
 	
 	
 		well the advantage is sometimes i'm too tired to eat
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now i mean they really offer classes in the mornings and there's even one class at noon
 		but i can't really see breaking up the middle of the day going off and doing aerobics taking a shower getting back to work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i know some people who do that as well and i can't understand that either i mean you know i in the morning i come to uh uh work with uh wet hair and you know and kind of uh not breathless but just
