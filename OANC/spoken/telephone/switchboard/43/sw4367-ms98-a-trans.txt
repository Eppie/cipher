 
     		
 	
 		now
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well let's see i see i'm gonna i'm gonna be guilty of not being able to say a whole lot about this i'm not real
 		i don't have a budget  uh what i basically am a do is i i have a
 		a job which which i which makes more money than i need to to work with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so the money i have left over is pretty much put into investments
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so i'm real guilty of uh of not really doing a whole lot of planning as to how i'm going to set things aside it just it either goes into investment or it goes into things that i want
 		or it goes or it goes uh goes into the bills you know one or the other i just keep a balance on the checking book and that's it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right okay well that's good position to be in i guess if you don't have to worry about budgeting that what's left over goes to investments
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you don't you don't then actually plan that this month i'm gonna invest five hundred or five thousand or whatever it might be
 	
 	
 		well the one thing i've always done is i've put uh uh on my on my uh from when i started even since since the very beginning i always said that i would put five hundred dollars aside every month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so you always put aside at least five hundred dollars okay well i guess that's sort of a budget then at least partial
 	
 	
 		right and
 		right oh it it is a budget i mean i certainly consider it to be a budget but i was just under the idea that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i knew i could i would be able to do that and that uh you you have to be uh responsible for your own
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh  retirement and welfare and so i said okay this you know i i can do this so i will do that you know so it early you know when i first started in that you know quite a few years ago i said i i know that i will always be able to afford this
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i said that well you know if i
 		if i start making a significant more amount of money i i would put more into it
 	
 	
 		um-hum sure sure
 	
 	
 		and make a new budget but i've
 		uh it's cost of living has gone up in in with respect to my salary or better  so i've actually probably making less money than i was when i started
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum okay
 	
 	
 		so although i have not changed i have not changed that number even though you know cost of living has made it equivalently less
 	
 	
 		right right sure well i think that's true of all of us the um well my wife and i both work and we do plan
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we try to plan major purchases and we have agreed that we don't spend over a hundred dollars on anything without talking with the other one
 		so i wouldn't just go out and buy a
 	
 	
 		well that
 	
 	
 		you know a i don't know a new computer  uh without
 	
 	
 		well certainly certainly your in a family situation you you'd expect a little bit more uh uh you more structured and
 	
 	
 		well that's true that's true uh certainly when you're single you don't have to worry about consulting with someone else and uh that type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right i just kind of consult  with uh uh me myself and i you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure sure you have a committee meeting of all yourself me myself and i okay
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's right  uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i see
 	
 	
 		so that makes that makes it a lot that makes it of course a lot easier um and i've always been fairly conscientious i've never really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i don't buy anything really on a whim i do buy things
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		that that i want even though i may not they may not be something that i really need but i always find the best price for it and i look around for a long time and and let it let myself get past that that initial state
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 		so you're careful rather than just extravagant and just grab anything that happens to meet your fancy
 	
 	
 		right
 		right you know i i i don't just sit there oh i like that i got to get it no i i say now give myself a little time to sit there and say do i really want it and if i really want it then i try to look for a good price for it
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		and then i buy it
 	
 	
 		okay well we do that same kind of planning in that if we're going to get something you know whatever it may be and we're comfortable and have most the things we need or want the
 	
 	
 		but i do
 	
 	
 		we'd you know certainly shop around before buying the new computer or the new VCR or something even once we had planned
 		that that's what we were going to get we wouldn't just go read the ad in the paper and run right down and buy it or something even if we'd planned to get the thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right my i've always  you know that's what what  an accusation that an awful lot of people make towards our
