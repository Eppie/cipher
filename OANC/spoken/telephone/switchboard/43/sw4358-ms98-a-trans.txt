 
     		
 	
 		okay what is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh basically they're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect and they do have bins set up but
 		i live in a a metropolitan area and uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that
 	
 	
 		well here they and uh live in an apartment complex and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins
 	
 	
 		i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do  something like that because it does take extra effort
 		whether and and i think that and i know Massachusetts has a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now
 		and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh that's the majority of people that i know of anyways
 		where people aren't really you know ecoconscious it's just the fact that it's something they have to do and i'm not going to throw a bottle away it's like throwing a nickel away that type of thing
 	
 	
 		right they
 	
 	
 		but uh people need to be more conscious of it
 	
 	
 		they're here they're trying to push through a bill and a lot of people are against it and it's going to create a lot more work for the uh
 		the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah  no it didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans um and and matter of fact i think it took like three tries to for it to go through
 		but and it's been pretty successful and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know people would drink have a drink of soda instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle so
 		it's it's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth but more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing
 		and that's the big thing i think that they they try to promote
 	
 	
 		right i think here if they uh
 		instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh
 		you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a good idea
 		yeah
 		there there definitely has to be a motivation factor and i know that at where where i work i work for a defense contractor
 		and there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh styrofoam usage
 		because of the uh the process involved in styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that and and they're very proactive and uh
 		uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh china wear rather than uh styrofoam stuff so so it it it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it i think that's that's what they need to do be more proactive like that
 	
 	
 		uh i know uh i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books uh
 		usually have them come from  you know projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of annual
 		trash
 	
 	
 		yeah they they just matter of fact that that reminded me of an article i saw in the paper the local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school and what they'll do is they'll recycle it
 		because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh
 		trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time a guy went to a dump a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty
 		because they don't they don't degrade over such a period of time
 	
 	
 		well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper they contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now i think they've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay
