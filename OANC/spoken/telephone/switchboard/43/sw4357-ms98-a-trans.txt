 
     		
 	
 		hi um the most experience i know about that is just when we had my grandma and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she lived with us when i was a little girl for about three or four years and then we had to put her in a rest home and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh because you couldn't take care of her anymore huh
 	
 	
 		yeah she had to have nurses care
 	
 	
 		yeah that's rough isn't it
 	
 	
 		and yeah it was a really hard decision because i she had nine kids and they had all decided that between the nine of them they could keep her at their home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		but uh her health just failed so much that they couldn't do that she needed an IV and things
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really hard my grandma is uh
 		just turned ninety
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and she's still on her own
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and she's down in Phoenix and i don't know what we'll do when she can't take care of herself her her son my dad is dead
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she has a daughter  my aunt uh who lives in another state but uh
 		she has
 	
 	
 		and then there's just the grandkids
 	
 	
 		uh well i'm like the uh yeah i'm my sister and i are the grandkids are her only grandkids
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		so i don't i don't know what's going to happen with her but she's amazingly strong uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what's neat is when they don't have to go into a rest home or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i don't know i guess uh  most of us uh probably end up there sooner or sooner or later
 	
 	
 		yeah my grandpa lived to be ninety four and
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		his grandma or his wife was uh ten years younger than him and she kept him at home his uh about the last two years of his life she had him in a hospital bed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know the port a potty and stuff she he couldn't get up or anything but she threatened that she'd never put that man in a rest home and she never did
 	
 	
 		boy that's amazing that's a lot of stress
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh she has osteoporosis  i don't know how to say it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		anyway where their back bends and stuff and the bones deteriorate and it really did a toll on her lifting him and stuff but she
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		she would have died before she let anyone put him in there in a rest home
 	
 	
 		amazing
 	
 	
 		but when my grand when my one grandma that did go in the rest home we found a really nice one the you know we'd go visit every night
 	
 	
 		uh-huh every night wow that's dedicated
 	
 	
 		and she only
 		well she was only there for about a month and she was really bad we you know we knew it was coming
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and i you know we felt really bad for putting her there and stuff she was unconscious and so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know a lot of people say she didn't even know she was there but
 		still it was nice to be with her and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a tough emotional uh issue
 	
 	
 		well nowadays the expense is going so crazy i mean some people they need it but they can't afford it and those are the families i feel so bad for
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah that's tough
 	
 	
 		you could lose your whole retirement or whatever just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		taking and you know nowadays a lot of kids are taking care of their parents you know because they can't afford a rest home or whatever
 		and that does a double toll on the kids
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know if i could ever put my parents in a rest home but
 		i don't know how we would afford it either
 	
 	
 		i remember one time i was uh
 		i was in a Mexican restaurant here in Seattle
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i i was sitting alone in this booth reading and eating and i overheard some  folks in the next booth who i think some of them worked at the restaurant they were
 		a little younger than me and they were talking about the differences between i don't know whether they were from Mexico or or but they were you know definitely Latin American
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they were talking about the differences between uh how uh our country cares for old people and what it was like back home
 		and they were just appalled that anybody could  put somebody in a you know in a rest home
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah they weren't course they weren't talking about uh where you know you're absolutely unable to care for them but it was it you know they would come from large extended families
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		where you know the the old people were uh were at home
 	
 	
 		living all together weren't they
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh most people don't want to live that way today  in this country
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't even know if i can handle living with my parents let alone three generations
 	
 	
 		yeah  God
 		yeah i don't know i and i've been single so long i don't even know if i could handle living with a wife
 	
 	
 		that is a challenge
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm probably  incorrigible you know
 	
 	
 		that and you know a lot of people say it's good for the elderly because they can be with you know people with their same interest and their same age and stuff but i don't know i i would never want to be in a rest home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i really don't think i'd want to
 	
 	
 		well my grandma's in a retirement community now and uh
 		seems to like it there a lot and stays really active and
 	
 	
 		does she have a home or an apartment
