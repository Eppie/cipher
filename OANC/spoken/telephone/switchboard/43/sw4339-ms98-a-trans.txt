 
     		
 	
 		yeah Jonathan uh you you say you say it's near and dear to your heart buying a car is uh something you're contemplating i take it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh fantasizing about can't do it right now our situation is that we're a two car family
 	
 	
 		ah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i have a mini van we bought a few years ago it's got a uh five year loan so that's still got a couple years to run
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the car i get to drive is a uh Nissan Sentra that's gonna be ten years old next month so
 	
 	
 		wow  you get
 	
 	
 		i think about uh sprucing that up in a couple years when i can
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what do you think you'll uh what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next
 	
 	
 		well  since i just turned forty i'm thinking about a forty year old man's car's something uh something real sporty but uh realistically with uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that uh wouldn't wind up putting their knees in their throat when they sat in the backseat something a little seating room
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well i think the next car we get will probably be a  well i i like Buicks we have a Buick Century now it's a nineteen eighty seven
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh whatever i get i wanna have uh air bags uh both driver's and passenger side and a four door because
 		it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them stoop down to get over so i think the four door is probably a major requirement and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car
 		uh
 		you know i'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh something that'll carry it around safely i guess is best best way to describe it
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		right now we've got a V-6 in it and that seems to be just fine i know they said they're coming out with some V-8s now and i think that's probably a little overkill for this day and age
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm surprised to hear that the V-8s are coming back uh they've got some pretty powerful 6s
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you know V-8s seem to be a return of the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon
 	
 	
 		right
 		i uh i drive a a truck a Ford truck i i like trucks because they're spacious and
 		it's handy to haul things uh it's not related to my business i just you really use it basically for transportation but there's so many occasions when i've had to
 		move some members of the family or do this or that it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one
 	
 	
 		sure
 		is uh traction much of an issue for you up there terms of
 	
 	
 		traction uh not really um you know it's a two wheel drive truck and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive i probably ought to be home anyway
 	
 	
 		actually uh pretty good way of looking at it yeah we uh we had a small accident with our mini van
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		a few years ago a case where there was a sort of freak ice storm and we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car and
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		this is a rear wheel drive model so we got some monster studded snow tires after that haven't had any problem since
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		what kind of what make is the mini van
 	
 	
 		it's a Mazda
 	
 	
 		Mazda i see
 	
 	
 		and uh we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and uh
 		driveability fuel economy isn't great being a minivan but uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around so we've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		one of my sons has a a Plymouth uh van or you know uh uh that same type of thing the Voyager i guess
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh they have a a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff and of course as he gets friends i'm sure that'll
 		be even handier so i know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that we're gonna be uh owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway
 	
 	
 		uh what about uh all wheel drive is that something that you'd be interested in or is that a not an issue
 	
 	
 		uh  i'd be satisfied with a a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and even as as light as that is with uh the small tires it's it's done pretty well in winter uh again like you if conditions are are that bad i probably don't wanna be driving anyway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i know i'd be happy with a a reasonable uh four door you know again we've we've got the same issue with getting kids into the
