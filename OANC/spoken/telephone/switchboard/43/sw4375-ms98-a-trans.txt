 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you have a pet
 	
 	
 		yes i do i have a dog do you have pet
 	
 	
 		i have uh
 		see three canaries
 	
 	
 		oh i have never been fortunate enough to have a canary well let me rephrase that i've had them but i don't have luck with them is there a secret
 	
 	
 		oh we put uh vitamins in the water and uh we don't take really great care of them but uh we just make sure that their
 		their water has vitamins in it and uh
 		
 
 		and some of them are hardier than others the ones that are really hearty are the ones that are that are uh
 		how shall i say it variegated ones the the real brightly colored ones don't seem to be too hardy
 		because they've been bred for looks and not for strength
 	
 	
 		oh really i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		so what kind of a dog do you have
 	
 	
 		i have a mutt he's part pit and part boxer
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but he is a
 		very good dog he's very which surprised me because i've had such um
 		repercussions about having a part Pit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		especially around children but he's really good i can't complain
 	
 	
 		well the i think the important thing uh
 		we've had several dogs and
 		and uh
 		my wife keeps going for these beautiful you know how shall i say it
 		the beautiful dog is the one that catches her eye and so i keep telling her that beauty is not uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is not important when you've got a dog intelligence is
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		now there's nothing worse than a dumb dog and this you know just like a dumb friend so to speak
 	
 	
 		just she what does she like in particular anything particular
 	
 	
 		uh as far as the pets
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um she likes the fluffy ones and the ones that are you know that are how shall i say it
 		they're really good looking but i like mutts myself
 	
 	
 		they tend to take a lot of time
 		whenever you get those kinds you have to
 		brush them continually and that type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah and and well like i say they're they're picked for they're bred for looks and so they're like these turkeys that you see in the in the uh
 		i don't know if you've heard stories about the differences between wild turkeys and and uh
 		and the ones that are bred for the meat but the ones that are bred for the meat will drown in a rain storm and because they're so dumb and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh they
 		uh wild turkeys are really smart and the thing that uh when it comes to pets is a a smart pet is really a lot of fun
 		they that's been my experience but uh you don't get them by getting them for their looks you got to get them for their you know how where they look at you with bright eyes when they're little puppies and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that's true
 		do you think pets are uh
 		handicapped or are they uh very worthwhile having them around and what is their use
 		that was one of the questions i was told to um ask from the operator and i think that they're very useful especially for uh companionship
 		and that type of thing what is your opinion
 	
 	
 		i i feel the same thing pets are uh they add a new dimension they they give you something to think about when you're kind of tired or blue or something like that and uh they get you to think about something other than yourself
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		and they never talk back almost
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and they're always there when you need them
 	
 	
 		yeah and they uh and their it's kind of fun to rub them and
 		and uh well with canaries you don't do much of that but when they sing why it cheers you up
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		and i think that that uh they also give you a sense of of
 		somebody is depending on you you've got to do something for them or or they uh
 		they suffer
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so it adds a dimension that that uh you're kind of in control and that's
 		kind of sad when people neglect pets but
 		so let's see how how old is your dog
 	
 	
 		oh he's young he's only a he he just turned a year so he's really um
 		just starting out in the world
 	
 	
 		got to wait
 		
 
 		well have you uh let's see what else have you had other pets beside this
 	
 	
 		yes i've had basenjies also i use to and they've um
 	
 	
 		they're the ones with the high pitched bark or
 	
 	
 		they don't bark at all they have a yodel and uh i haven't found any in this area anybody in this area that raises them to uh get another one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's how we and we came across this one that we've had quite by accident my daughter found a had a family that wasn't taking care of it and just didn't want it and in the meantime we were looking for a basenji and uh
 		we weren't very successful but uh they're an intelligent dog and they're very uh
 		um
 		independent but they're not so much independent that they uh are like a cat people a lot of people
