 
     		
 	
 		before the one will take um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay let's see i guess um
 		i can start i'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing yeah
 	
 	
 		are you really
 	
 	
 		um
 		so i'm looking at um something larger than what we have we've got like an eighty four Charger that's about gone and a uh an eighty nine Horizon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh which are both kind of small
 	
 	
 		so i'm looking for something a little bigger yeah um
 		so we were thinking minivan for a while and uh we're looking at uh some just some four door five passenger sedans as well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh are you looking for an American car or you you open to buying foreign cars
 	
 	
 		um i don't really have a preference either way i guess it you know it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know  i guess the American cars had a bad reputation but i haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones i've had
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		personally i have a Japanese car right now and i really like it a lot uh i think the Japanese really build good cars and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know buy American keep American auto workers working right now but i feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while if i were to buy another car i would be uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i would be partial to buying another Japanese car but i would also look at American cars but when i bought the car that i bought now i did that also and i just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product so if i were
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean even even if it's just little details it seems like uh they you know like uh there's a door seal that  doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while and and it's clearly just a a design problem there
 	
 	
 		right
 		right it is um i'm kind of right now the next car i buy is gonna be
 		sort of a sports car i would really like to have a sports car um  i don't really i don't have a family so i don't need a a minivan or such to uh  haul people around in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i'm looking for more a a two passenger car that uh
 	
 	
 		oh like a Miata or something like that
 	
 	
 		well i like the Miata but i don't like it enough to buy it i would buy something actually the the car that i really like right now is an Eagle Talon which is an American car but uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		something along that lines
 		uh because i have a an economy car right now which is okay but uh i think i i'd like to move on to something a little better
 	
 	
 		interesting
 		yeah
 		that's interesting yeah i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because i look for you know size and safety and then mileage probably
 	
 	
 		right
 		right that's when i bought the car that i bought i was looking for mileage and i was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last a long time i was get that i would get a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for the money that i was going to spend that i would get a return that was that was worth that money
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i can i think in terms of computer terminology i look at you know price performance and things like that
 	
 	
 		so
 		right exactly
 	
 	
 		and then a little bit at life expectancy i guess but it you know depends on what you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what you pay initially but you know i've got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on the Charger actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage
 	
 	
 		um that's right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it so
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		uh i've had uh
 		i've had one or two American cars i think and
 		and they were okay i had a Pontiac once and and i never had a problem with it but
 		uh my mother had a Dodge at one point and i i had driven it a few times and i really did not feel that it that i would buy a Dodge  just just from well actually i had a uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		a Dodge Omni at one point and that was i think what really prejudiced me against American cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i guess you'd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 		but yeah it it's hard to beat some of the uh
 		like i guess we're in particular we're looking at a like a ninety one Corsica that's uh buy back at a they say GM sponsored auction but i think they're obliged to have these things because
 		Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to GM
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		which is a good deal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		because uh i guess um i mean well ninety two's granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		on the lot so all the depreciation has been taken off and
 		guess the dealer comes out okay you know i don't know what kind of i don't know what GM corporate kind of hit the i don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off of it
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 		yeah i'm sure they did
 	
 	
 		so but uh i don't know we keep looking at that minivan it's just you know we can get a like a Caravan for right twelve five but that's a little more than we want to spend right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh it's interesting but uh
 		i don't know if if uh it it seems to be
