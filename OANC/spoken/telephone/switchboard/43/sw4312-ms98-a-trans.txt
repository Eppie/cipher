 
     		
 	
 		what kind of music you into
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh
 		lot of different forms of uh music in fact it's easier for me to say uh the types of music that i don't like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal
 	
 	
 		the opera yeah it's right on track i like classical but i can't deal with opera at all
 	
 	
 		i've
 	
 	
 		and heavy metal uh it's noisy i'm into uh some industrial music that's
 		a a bit even harder than that but it's it's got to have a point to it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i don't mind music that's difficult to listen to but uh the the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		basic point of heavy metal which which seems to be music to annoy you is uh gets a little annoying
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what kind of progressive stuff
 	
 	
 		oh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh Nirvana and uh
 		oh you know i'm thirty so lot of the stuff i was listening to in my teens like the Clash and and the Sex Pistols and REM
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that sort of stuff uh REM makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being
 		uh you know ultra mainstream at this point and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah it's a lot of people like like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out i think that's pretty much you know bull
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because REM really hasn't changed it's it's it's interesting they're producing uh similar music and it's good music but you know people have picked up on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's good i'm impressed
 	
 	
 		i think it is uh for a while there music seemed to really have popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it i was really tired of uh
 		the Michael Bolton Michael Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i could uh go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money
 	
 	
 		uh but he picked the right songs and
 	
 	
 		i guess
 	
 	
 		and that  that's about all he had going for him or still has for that matter
 	
 	
 		that that and a marvelous hairdo
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i'm sure that that sold that sold a lot for him that's all you really need for a lot of lot of pop i'm kind i've kind of like developed a a short hatred for for pop
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it just seems like there's no no real point you hear the same same tune over and over again in a thousand guises and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well it's it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i like a lot of classical music but i also dislike
 		uh some classical music and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i can i can believe that what kind of things are you do you like in classical what's the standard
 	
 	
 		uh stuff that i like uh i like Bach i tolerate Vivaldi i can't stand uh uh Debussy or Debussy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh uh i like Tchaikovsky he can make a lot of noise when he's uh so inclined uh and some of some
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		stuff that i like uh for instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's interesting music but it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh philharmonic uh just because number one it's Frank Zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know we're we're much better off playing uh Beethoven's ninth that's right you know we'll we'll do we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's safe
 	
 	
 		and it it it just isn't chance taking enough for me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another
 		and that uh you know if you've heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times
