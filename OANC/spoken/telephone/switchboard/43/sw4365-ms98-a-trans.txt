 
     		
 	
 		all right i guess well we're recording now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh well the last thing i had done was a a muffler  put on my truck
 		and then i usually do my own oil changes
 	
 	
 		yeah my car needs uh
 		an uh
 		i think a muffler but um
 		not sure because i haven't looked at it yet it's just getting louder
 	
 	
 		hm yeah
 	
 	
 		to live in New England
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		where do you live
 	
 	
 		i live in Fort Worth Texas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh and uh
 		i guess uh so do you do your own car repairs or do you take it to the garage to have it done
 	
 	
 		i mostly do my own
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i find it uh more satisfactory
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i like to save the money too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's true i try to do most of my own to  but nowadays a lot of these cars are getting to be especially on engines getting to be computerized and stuff so
 	
 	
 		yeah makes a lot harder
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		i've got uh some hesitation problem
 		that uh
 		i haven't figured figured out it's got fuel injection and it's all computerized so
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh i think sometimes that could be the computer going bad on you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the only way to fix that is by taking it
 		and having them analyze the computer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because we had the same problem  on our car
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh they took it in and they found a problem with the computer itself
 		because it quit on my wife one time coming home from
 		from a friends house it just quit on her died on her
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		but other than that i usually like i said i try i do all the spark plugs changes wires and i do my own tune-ups and stuff
 		uh
 		other than the major stuff i usually take it to the car you know repair shop because i don't have much time to do much anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's one thing finding the time to do it
 	
 	
 		that's for sure
 		uh
 		what
 	
 	
 		it did you do your muffler
 	
 	
 		no i take it down to Midas and have them do it
 		that way it's guaranteed if anything goes wrong with it they got to replace it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's not a fun job either
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 		it was uh pretty simple really they they did it in about a half hour you know and
 		it would've cost me just as much for the whole thing because it came with a an assembly
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		uh it
 		it uh unbolted just in front of the muffler and it went to the tail pipe and it was just all one piece
 		and it would've cost me just as much to
 		from the dealer just to get the
 		the part than it would be to have it done down there so i just went ahead and had them do it
 	
 	
 		hm
 		what um what kind of vehicle
 	
 	
 		at the i got a Nissan pickup
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the like i said the price of the assembly would've been more just about as much as
 		having Midas do it so
 		
 
 		it was just easy just to have them go ahead and do it real quick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes a a lot of times the the bolts are all rusty and
 		makes it hard to get it apart anyway but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		last time i looked underneath it all i mean just rusted to pieces
 	
 	
 		well yeah  if you let go far enough it'll fall off
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh oh
 		but i usually like i said i usually do a lot of my own work and uh
 		the only we've only only had one like i said had one major problem with our car
 		and i let them handle it at the car dealer since it was still under warranty
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		do you do all your own tune-ups and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		spark plugs
 		the coolant changing the oil
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i
 		see
 		i had to do quite a few things when i when i bought this car used
 		uh
 		the alternator was loose uh
 		had to fix that
 		and they had the uh
