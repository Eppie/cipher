 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh well Steve do you take your entire uh family camping
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we really haven't been camping per se here but we've camped in Wyoming
 	
 	
 		well you have do you take the children with you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i got a one child he's ten years old when we go camping uh we normally have to round up another child to keep him occupied
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		otherwise otherwise he drives us nuts
 	
 	
 		yeah well that that's basically the same way with us but we we kind of play games and stuff with him when we're camping
 	
 	
 		do you do you wilderness camp
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i have before before i uh got married i haven't since i've been married though
 	
 	
 		your your wife doesn't like that wilderness camping does she
 	
 	
 		well she she likes to go camping but we just haven't really had a chance to really go camping
 	
 	
 		yeah my wife thinks Holiday Inn is wilderness camping
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she uh she got to have a bathroom and showers we live on the lake uh there's a very large lake here it's called Lake Laniers in north Georgia
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my house is on the lake so
 		there's a lot of places to camp around around here where the they have rest rooms and showers and stuff like but the lake's really crowded so we normally go the mountains we found some nice little places in the mountains
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's a lot of state run camp sites now this they're charging us now do they charge you in Texas
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm not sure if they do or not it's uh i think uh some of the privately owned places do but i'm not sure about the government owned
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh they do here they they uh
 		you pay taxes to support it and then uh you pay to get in too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know like a user fee i think they call them now so now do y'all do you fish and go camp do you take a boat or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well no not really we just usually kind of go camping and tent and cook and
 		and just fish off the shore
 	
 	
 		yeah it uh do you uh load the car down till the springs are dragging the ground
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we do we yeah we we got uh my wife is putting tables and chairs
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		got to have the comforts of home huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it we have a hard time getting the uh recliners bolted on high on the car too
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well it takes three days to load the car and three days to unload it and we camp for about a day and a half
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i can understand that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but we really don't
 		when we go we kind of plan everything out and
 		we don't uh take a lot of stuff with us so
 	
 	
 		do you know  how old are your children Steve
 	
 	
 		uh we just got a five year old
 	
 	
 		a five year old boy that's rough to camping in when they're five it'n it
 	
 	
 		well not really he's pretty good you know he  when he when we ask him to do something he usually does goes and does it
 	
 	
 		well when when uh ours is like i say is ten years old and
 		i think they might be a little bit more hard to handle too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you got to keep them occupied and then plus you end up with a fish hooks in your ears and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i kind of i kind of got a  got him to where he's uh just got a weight on the end of his right now so
 		he really doesn't know what catching fish is like so he just kind of practice casting right now
 	
 	
 		well that's all they care about anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		casting that's all my boy cares about
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		seeing how for he can throw it i've tried to explain to him fish can swim
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he don't believe me
 	
 	
 		but before i came in the service my dad always took us camping in the Bighorns
 		in Wyoming
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we did a lot of that just about every year with the family so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it was
 	
 	
 		we drove we drove through there and looked that looks like it'd be beautiful out there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it is well one one summer we went in July and went camping and one morning we got up there's snow on the ground
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		sort of
 	
 	
 		it kind of surprises you you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know if i could take that last time we went camping i went with my brother and his wife and
 		we went up the on top of this mountain it was a little narrow road
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it takes it's just eighteen miles but it takes like a hour and a half to get up that road it's a rough road
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we get up there and we sit around and we get ready to get ready for the camp that night and and they didn't bring the poles to hold their tent up
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so we're all had to cram this one little tiny tent and it rained all night long
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i was stuck at the door and it just it just flooded me all night long this so that has been our last little camping experience
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh we enjoyed it if we if you don't get pneumonia
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's pretty nice to get out and see the wilderness every now and then you know
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well there's getting less and less of it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i think
