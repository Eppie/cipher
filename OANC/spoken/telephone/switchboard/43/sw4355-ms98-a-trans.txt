 
     		
 	
 		we're all set there um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		have you ever been tested for drugs
 	
 	
 		uh no i sure haven't huh-uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i've worked in uh many jobs where it was a requirement to uh
 		for the actual position
 		i've worked for power plants across the country as a nuclear inspector
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and one of their requirements for that job was basically to have a drug test
 	
 	
 		what kind of test do they do i mean just
 	
 	
 		just urine urine tests
 	
 	
 		for
 		urine tests
 	
 	
 		yeah checking for various types of drugs
 	
 	
 		uh have you heard that they can test so far back as say six or seven months whether you've done drugs by uh taking some of your hair
 	
 	
 		um i've heard of that happening
 		i've from everything i've experienced the only way they've ever done it is urine tests
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but is that possible though
 	
 	
 		i would imagine it probably is
 	
 	
 		oh okay uh
 		hm well no i've never been tested for uh drugs or anything like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum how do you feel about uh testing in in the uh
 	
 	
 		work place
 	
 	
 		work place
 	
 	
 		uh i don't think it's really necessary it just depends on the type job it is
 		if it's a job that's uh dealing with say
 		uh
 		like a pharmacy job or something like that maybe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know a certain amount of testing should be done or in the field of a doctor or something like that
 		but uh as far as just
 		yeah every day job i would say no
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just certain categories i would say
 	
 	
 		anything dealing with the safety of the public or
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah i feel pretty strong about that too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's strange i the last job i had up in
 		uh Plymouth New Hampshire it was for an accounts position
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i actually had to take a drug test prior to getting that job
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		which i thought was rather unusual since i didn't really wasn't effecting the safety of the public at all
 	
 	
 		hm that is unusual
 	
 	
 		but it i think it shows a growing trend uh in the work place to do drugs testing they don't want people who
 		uh basically have that characteristic characteristic in there or that trait in their character
 	
 	
 		um
 		but the thing is that do you think at some some point you know probably about everyone has has experienced drugs of some type
 	
 	
 		what excuse me i didn't hear that
 	
 	
 		do you think that it's possible that uh about every individual have experienced some drugs of some type do you think
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so at all we we're uh recently at a little camp out with about fifteen people and well i'm thirty one but lot a lot of the people that were there
 		were in the twenty one to twenty four age group
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a good portion of them had not experienced drugs because that topic had come up they hadn't even experimented with it
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 	
 	
 		which i see as a good trend toward the future
 	
 	
 		right
 		is it a pretty large so it must be a pretty large percentage still that experiment with drugs right
 	
 	
 		i think in the past there has been
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i think definitely in the seventies and early eighties
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		it almost became a a popular thing to just to experiment and try it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh as far as users regular users
 		um again it also depends on what what what areas you're looking at too
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think in more in your suburban suburban areas
 		i think you see less of it
 		um
 		and more in the cities uh it's more likely you're more likely to encounter that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's true
 		well what what do you think the chances of of drugs ever diminishing uh because a lot of it i feel that they catch the people that handling drugs but they're not catching the people that bring in drugs into the country
 	
 	
 		um i think it's not necessarily a losing battle but i don't think it's one you can win i think it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's drugs have been around since the beginning of time just about
 		um in one form or another people looking for a way to relax
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um unfortunately
 		they're people the drug makers the illegal drug makers are experimenting with more dangerous variations of what use to be very harmless drugs
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		or relatively harmless and also our technical our society has become more technical so that the when you use a drug the ramifications of uh side of uh a side effect harming other people has become more uh frequent
 	
 	
 		hm
 		that's interesting
 	
 	
 		you know the chance of getting into an automobile now a days and hurting someone being on drugs or in a plane if you're a pilot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		it's pretty uh pretty high
 		whereas three hundred years ago  the worse you could do was probably fall off a horse
 	
 	
 		it sure was true uh
