 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i work for one of the defense contractors out here  actually it's it's not a defense contractor it's uh a federally funded research and development center
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kind of like the Mitre Corporation only uh uh we work mainly with the Air Force in terms of satellites
 	
 	
 		alright and um so um in other words your your bread and butter comes from the federal government
 	
 	
 		the the government yes uh
 	
 	
 		right so your your uh your life sort of follows it's  flow
 	
 	
 		that's correct
 	
 	
 		so um how are the benefits set up are they set up like they are in the federal government or are they
 	
 	
 		uh actually no um it turns out that uh we are a non profit organization so the the benefits are different um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean basically you get you know the the health care coverage uh one of the big pluses for this company was you would get um
 		three weeks of vacation to start normally in California when you work for one of the defense contractors they give you three weeks to start but all of the companies shut down between Christmas and New Year's so you end up
 		in essence only getting two weeks of voluntary vacation and one week of involuntary vacation is you want to look at it that way
 	
 	
 		sure i see what you're saying
 	
 	
 		uh where as in our uh for our company they did not have until very recently a plant shutdown between Christmas and New Year's
 		uh the idea is that you've got the three weeks and you can take it whenever you want it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that was a big plus benefit for this company
 	
 	
 		and that's just recently been taken away from you
 	
 	
 		uh well the past couple of years because of uh cut backs and and whatnot they uh basically have put down and told people that you either take a week of vacation between Christmas and New Year's or take a week of no pay
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh the it's up to you you have the choice and so the the company does shut down between Christmas and New Year's i don't believe that this is a long term
 		solution that they're going to use but uh they have been doing it for the past couple of years and they may do it for a year or two more
 	
 	
 		development yeah
 		well um you say now you say you get your health benefits is this a one hundred percent coverage
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh no i don't think any of unless of course you go with an HMO
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh the thing is that they also do not have uh eye glass coverage so if you need eye glasses you're on your own uh they also do not provide uh well they do provide dental if you go with an HMO though you lose the
 		um the choose choice of doctors if you take their you know they have one of these cafeteria plans so you you either choose the HMO or you choose the
 	
 	
 		ability to choose
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i guess blue cross and blue shield is who they have now and the idea there is that if you go with one of their associated doctors they'll pay eighty percent if you go with a non associated doctor they pay seventy percent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that that  i have to admit i mean when i first started out you were covered completely and it was not a um
 		an HMO type of thing i i when i first started out in engineering i worked for RCA back in the mid seventies and uh they just covered everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh you know i've watched this slowly erode erode erode until the point where now um i figure that the next thing is going to be uh you're going to have to pay big bucks and they're only going to pay cover certain certain uh diseases
 	
 	
 		well that's it certainly looks the way things are headed right now if uh something isn't done at the i guess at the federal level or
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or something i don't know about this but it's uh i um worked for a number of years as support staff in law law firms in the Washington Area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i kind of had exactly the same experience uh law the especially during the seventies and eighties law firms were just rolling in the money
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it's a little bit less that way now the recession has even hurt a lot of the big law firms in this area but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the result uh was during that period that not only did we get one hundred percent benefits in terms of health care and so forth but they were rather extravagant plans that we were
 		party to with with uh full dental and
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh you know optical stuff stuff for our eyes and uh and so forth and i have to confess i had a couple of real bad health scares during that time and found that it really came in handy the HMO idea
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 		wow
 	
 	
 		appeared on the scene i guess in the mid eighties and i tried a couple of them out
 		uh and in fact have eventually settled on one of them i've change jobs now but this the same HMO is still available in my current position and and um
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		it's it's uh i the interesting thing they've done some interesting things with the HMO's in this area where you there are a number of doctors and you can choose amongst the doctors that are available in fact uh
 		one of them that's run by Prudential has essentially signed up a bunch of private physicians in the the Washington Area
