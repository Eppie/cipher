 
     		
 	
 		one way or the other we're now recording
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um
 		um oh yeah home repair
 	
 	
 		you were helping your parents
 	
 	
 		right i still am really they're um
 		sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta in Candler Park and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we've done  lots to it we've taken out the glass and most the windows and the sashes and replaced them and
 	
 	
 		so you're remodeling okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well i i just live in a i live in apartment now i uh
 		two summers ago i went to Massachusetts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i went with a friend of mine and we undertook a building house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and this was um a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions and it's preconstructed you might say
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we started in um
 		we started from an empty lot with um trees and stuff on it and we had to cut them uh down and clear the lot we had to call in the escavators and have them dig the basement and pour the basement and um
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		went from the ground up our
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		one of our main problems was as well in Massachusetts i thought i was gonna well it was a fun time but i thought gosh summer time you know well all it ever did was rain and thunderstorms and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		one thing is that we're we had we were gonna pour the basement foundation
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we're in the process and it started pouring down rain
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i guess we had most of it done but the end result what happened was that
 		some of the the water a lot of water settled on the top and it really didn't give a very good finish and some of the it was sort of sandy and and not um a very good finish
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it turned it was okay and it's only the basement floor so it was okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um it kept us pretty busy it was only um
 		there was well me and my friend and then we just had like two helpers and uh sort of a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a family type it wasn't you know like a commercial project just something that sort of just
 		you know like get your get his you know my brother brother and well maybe you know my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing and so the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes and and then materials coming in and so we're we're hopping around pretty good but overall yeah we got it done and it's a it's a three bedroom two bath house and it's pretty neat
 	
 	
 		wow
 		um-hum
 		nice
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		nice so uh i mean what was it for you just
 	
 	
 		well it was um for my friend's parents they had some property there and they'd lived in this
 		this old it's sort of like a farm you might say and they live in this old house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for something like thirty years or something and his mom just wanted a a new house you know that was been her dream and so we did that and uh she was really pleased with it so we came really great so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's great
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so what why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		where you live it gets very hot
 	
 	
 		yeah it does
 	
 	
 		and that's why you're and the the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in because the windows are something that is conducive to
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		temperature changes in um you know the solar game
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		have you what what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or
 	
 	
 		no we just we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass my parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay
 	
 	
 		and uh but  see in a lot of the windows um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's the house is eighty years old and it's had several owners and stuff and um  they had put plastic Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh these are so you have the sash windows in did did uh did it go go up and down oh i see
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah and so uh
 		and and so we wanted to get
 		all new stuff in there so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes there's a problem with those those are uh they usually most the time don't open very well
 	
 	
 		yeah ours didn't  and the ones that would open uh wouldn't wanna stay open they wanted to slam shut
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum and they also they're they they a lot of vibration and it causes the glass to crack it's a never never ending problem
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yep
 	
 	
 		afraid i haven't uh i haven't been in any really
 		home repair things lately i
