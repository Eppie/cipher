 		there's a sound like a panel topic we're talking about uh what we can do to make uh
 		make uh our government get a little more for it's money in other words
 	
 	
 		short and long long-term goals yeah
 	
 	
 		short long-term goals to be able to get
 		a better value
 		out of what we already pay
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i wanted to say something to you about Ross Perot are you familiar with the man
 	
 	
 		uh i've i've watched him yes he's  he's i've been told that that he uh well his ideologies won't work because he's too much of an authoritarian
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah but he does raise some interesting points like
 	
 	
 		he does i i i from just his speaking i i i hear a a very a strong tinge of integrity
 	
 	
 		uh-huh the uh
 		the the question he raised in my mind was uh he was speaking in front of the National Press Club the other day
 		and he said  let's think of some wild and crazy things to do to wipe out the four hundred billion dollar deficit that we've got
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um  remember we're thinking about wild and crazy things we'll throw anything out he said um let's say we take all the profits of the fortune five hundred
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for a year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		not enough money
 		only half as much as we need
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so another words
 		four hundred billion dollars is hell of a lot of money
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh and that's just he deficit just this year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there's apparently a hundred and eighty billion dollars that the president's own controller will tell you is fault and mismanagement
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think that would be the short-term goals
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		get rid of the fraud and mismanagement
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um apparently they have plenty of time
 		the boards right now for computer systems and other tracking methods to get rid of the fraud and everyone says well it's going to cost a billion dollars to implement this well a billion stacked against a hundred and eighty billion sounds like a good investment to me
 	
 	
 		but are we what do you think are we talking about
 		the
 		the mechanical element you might say or are we talking about the human element i think it's the human element
 	
 	
 		it's a human element but the mechanical element of it can i mean mechanical meaning a computer could help
 	
 	
 		exactly yes
 	
 	
 		could help track
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		uh and and find out what's going on you know statistical cross-referencing and and uh you know the the pork barrel and all that other stuff that they uh you know
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they do to keep in office to stay in office uh
 		i think term limitations are a viable a viable way to cut the amount of money we spend in government
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um if uh you know we we say the president can be limited to two terms and we don't limit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		congress critters at all
 	
 	
 		i think Dave i think one of the
 		another thing is that we have such a great disparity between the consumer and the businesses and that all reflects into the budget also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we
 		we the American people don't have faith in the government and they don't have faith in business
 	
 	
 		yeah especially now after this rubber gate thing you know they uh it's something that everyone can identify with and
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and uh if they can't even balance their own check book how in the worlds are they going to balance a trillion plus dollar budget
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well then you have you have President Bush going over to Japan to try to do some wrangling over there to for the trade deficit and they send the send the top executive from GM
 		and they're they're making
 		four and five times they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
 	
 	
 		um oh that
 	
 	
 		GM is trying to market their products and is
 		that that's another way is that the consumers just don't trust big business they just don't there's
 		so right there you have an element of of the political government you have an element of big business and you have the consumer watching and they're just going what's this
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i think um it's
 		uh i've been studying some libertarian views
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i've been thinking more and more that maybe we need to get government out of
 		out of business and away from business and out of everybody's hair
 	
 	
 		you know i i i mean i agree with you to a certain extent but the problem is with democracy with you know our capitalistic government
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the almighty dollar doesn't have any ethical code with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i it's just like how you know what would you do the Exxon Valdez
 		you see what what are we just just say are we taking government out of it we need those controls because
 		the in the our capitalistic society it's just those controls it's just it's
 		the business it starts going and if they can its its the dollar that that dictates and if they can find someplace to dump something or their pollution and we're polluting something unfortunately
 	
 	
 		well
