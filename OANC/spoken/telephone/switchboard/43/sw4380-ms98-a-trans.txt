 
     		
 	
 		recently graduated from high school meaning like uh you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		three or four years ago i'm a senior in in uh college now and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i can't really talk too much about the problems with uh public education in detail because the school system i went to was
 		uh really superb even though it was a public school system
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah i i feel that my uh i'm a junior in college now and i go to Tech Georgia Tech
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		i got a friend who goes there by the way i wanted to ask talk to you about that afterward okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay  uh
 		i've the high school i went to was uh
 		was a good one also and i well i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools because the one i went to was you know
 		i'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it was a a it's a more or less a suburban school system yes that's that was true for mine too um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		although i  i'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity but i don't think i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		you know i think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn i mean you know
 	
 	
 		yeah and i'm also i mean in the in those places where uh
 		like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that more than they would you know in areas where they
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true but  but uh i think i mean even more than that even i mean if you drop out in high school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you should still be able to read you know which it sounds i mean it sounds like uh now i think maybe it just started changing in the past few years because uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		they have more of these um sort of mandatory mandatory tests you have to take before you get a diploma but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh certainly before that there are people that you know like would graduate from high school and could barely read um and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really
 		i i i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning uh disabled or something but these people obviously weren't
 	
 	
 		that's hard for me to say since i didn't
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i didn't really grow well when i went to elementary school it it it wasn't in a great area but i still i mean i learned to read started learning to read when i was in kindergarten you know so i guess i can't really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can't say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed uh region
 		you know i guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the for those people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i mean i think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably i mean i don't i think
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know if people just
 	
 	
 		so i guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to
 		i don't get some kind of motivation to learn and
 	
 	
 		yeah and again i don't i mean again i don't know that i'm you know how qualified i mean i think it'd be interesting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school
 		uh you know sort of sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school you know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think that would be an interesting experience but uh i haven't done that
 	
 	
 		no i i can't say that i have either
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		but i do i do think that um i mean public education in general i think can work and i think it's a good thing
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've i've heard some i mean i've heard statistics statistics statistics and things that
 		that compare a public education to a private education i mean within like within the same uh income groups
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh
 		did send their kids to private schools i think they compare fairly you know fairly well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah i mean i don't i honestly don't really think i could have you know done much better than i did in the school system i was in you know i mean it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i  i know in my schools also i mean they they have a lot of uh
 		once once it seemed i got into high school they had a lot of uh accelerated accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that and that mean that that makes a big difference because uh when you're when you're taking classes with uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		with people that are really are interested in the in the subject and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean and in the
 		once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels
 		you well no i guess it was in junior high it was still three then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh which i mean actually i think that works pretty well i mean that that makes
