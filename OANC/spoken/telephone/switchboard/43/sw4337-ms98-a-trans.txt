 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		so uh what do you think about uh
 		uh how trials in America are right now with the jury of nine or twelve do you think that's fair
 	
 	
 		well um i believe a trial by twelve uh peers is fair i don't think the need for a unanimous vote is fair
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		nothing in our world seems to be by unanimous vote
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		except that
 		hm we're too uh diverse a cultures i believe to make a
 		complete agreement
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so you think that um majority rule majority rule is good enough for um deciding on a verdict of guilty or not guilty
 	
 	
 		i do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i really do
 	
 	
 		um something that's kind of interesting is uh i lived in Europe for a while and um in Germany they don't have trial by jury they have trial uh by
 		usually three judges
 		
 
 		and uh i've discussed with people and it's it's kind of interesting uh kind of an interesting concept it sounds strange at first not to have a jury by your peers but then um the argument for it
 		is that
 		um you know
 		people off the street really don't know much about law
 	
 	
 		i agree with that
 	
 	
 		and yeah and and then uh
 		i guess the argument is that they're easily influenced you know by by tricks by lawyers you know who dos do more psychology than trying to teach them what's right and wrong and the law they they use uh
 		you know techniques to sway their feelings whereas
 		professional
 		judges
 		um
 		you know know the ins and outs of the system better
 	
 	
 		i agree i think that's very true i'm um concerned that when we uh sentence a uh a criminal to for a certain amount of years that we don't really know what that means
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know ten years may mean one year in reality
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i don't think that most people are aware of that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i i wouldn't couldn't tell you if we sentenced someone tomorrow how long he'd actually be in jail
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		could you
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		me either
 	
 	
 		no couldn't
 	
 	
 		and i think they kind of depend on that these criminals
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah definitely i don't know i think the that the um alternative is something interesting to look into uh
 	
 	
 		but it
 	
 	
 		if you you know instead of
 		instead of juries just by by uh
 		uh peers juries by professional judges
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um but i guess uh
 		that would take a major constitutional change here
 	
 	
 		definitely would but i see where they would be experts
 	
 	
 		right um i mean i see also how they were you know when they made the constitution they were uh afraid of that kind of thing that you know that um if the
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		government has all the power to decide who's guilty and who's not they wanted to make checks and balances against that
 	
 	
 		right it could really throw the checks and balances out of whack
 		what if one of them is corrupt
 	
 	
 		right exactly
 	
 	
 		and he is the the decision the the main decision maker
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know the the they're split either way
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh does carry an implicit danger with it that way
 	
 	
 		it does but
 		that's kind of goes like our Supreme Court in a way
 	
 	
 		right  that's true too you know how does how does that work
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and who gets to point those people the politicians
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so they get to make the decision not the people
 	
 	
 		exactly i think it was i think it was more of a danger you know in the seventeen hundreds when um really you know like the King of England could decide who's guilty and who's not guilty i could see how they would
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		wanna protect against that so i think the danger is less today would be less of a risk of you know uh corrupt judges and the government forcing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you know someone to to be guilty for uh even though they're not or vice versa you know um but it's definitely something that would have to be watched very closely if they decided to do it that way
 	
 	
 		that's true i think a good start would be maybe some uh simple basic education into how the process really works for  children
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		on up i mean i know i know that we all learned but i really don't see it where the children are learning it nowadays
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they think it's a big game and you know
 	
 	
 		right and and um you know what what does jury duty mean not not many people really
 	
 	
 		are are you willing to take off from work and lose a day's pay or a week's pay
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is your boss willing to let you
 	
 	
 		right that's that's a really interesting issue too and um you know most people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		another interesting thing is you know most most most people try and get out of jury duty right
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 	
 	
 		so the people that actually become juries are it's not really just a random sampling of the
