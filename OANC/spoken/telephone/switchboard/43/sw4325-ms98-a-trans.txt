 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 		so
 	
 	
 		i guess
 	
 	
 		what kind of experience do you do you have then with child care
 	
 	
 		i think um
 		i wonder if that worked
 	
 	
 		does it say something
 	
 	
 		i think it usually does you might try um
 		i don't know hold it down a little longer
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		okay i
 	
 	
 		does it usually make a recording or something
 	
 	
 		well i don't remember it seemed like it did but it might not i guess i guess
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		we can start um
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		no i don't i don't have any kids i um my sister has a she just had a baby he's about five months old and she was
 		worrying about going back to work and what she was gonna do with him and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the different do you have kids
 	
 	
 		i have three
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i do
 		yes um i don't work though but i used to work and when i had two children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit but
 		i don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but does your sister live in a big community
 	
 	
 		um yeah she lives it's a it's a fairly large community she um got real lucky though she had a boss who um moved into a larger office
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she's able to take her baby to work with her
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and it's a small office that she works in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 		it's a it's a legal firm office and it's just one lawyer and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office there's no one else that works there
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so they have an extra room and everything for the baby so it works out pretty good for her
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how lucky
 		i i know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids and but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the community i'm in is not a real large one so there are a lot of people who babysit in their home that you know you either know them or know somebody who knows them  to get
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's fairly safe
 	
 	
 		to yeah to get references and that so
 		but um
 		i i don't
 		don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but
 		simply because there's so many kids and so many
 		
 
 	
 	
 		worried that they're not going to get enough attention
 	
 	
 		yeah and um you know colds and things like that get spread real easy and things but and they're expensive and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		course there's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		or they just watch them and let them play and things like that but
 		take a long time to find the right place
 	
 	
 		yeah and you and you don't always even know if it's it's
 		gonna be the right place or not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		anything i guess could happen
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because after
 		i guess after he you know gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care
 	
 	
 		um-hum when he starts toddling around and stuff yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah when when he's not when she can't
 		keep control of him and he starts crawling that's
 	
 	
 		um-hum it would be hard i think it would be kind of stressful it would be nice to have him around
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um seems like you know golly what if he cried at the wrong time or the phone rang or
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know at the wrong time  but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think she has problems with that too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well when you have kids will you work
 		do you work now
 	
 	
 		i don't know that's something i've considered um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i always kind of think it would be neat to
 		be able to watch them and be there for them all the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		is that what you do
 	
 	
 		um yeah uh actually i teach my kids at home
 		so i'm here all the time
 	
 	
 		oh so they don't go to school is it like um
 		oh what's that called it's a
 		correspondence school they do it at home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's interesting do you have to have any special training
 	
 	
 		so
 		not it depends on the state you live actually some laws
 		absolutely prohibit it some states um say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that our state doesn't yet
 		
 
 		say that and i'm not a certified teacher i went to college but i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now
 		and so
 	
 	
 		so they haven't been to public schools at all
 	
 	
 		one of them was for a couple of years
 		and so you know my oldest
 		he was and then my youngest two have never been
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so
 		anyway but we don't
 	
 	
 		so you've never had
