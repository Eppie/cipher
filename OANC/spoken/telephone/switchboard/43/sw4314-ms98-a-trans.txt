 		yeah
 		were you sailboating
 	
 	
 		yeah for the most part yeah i had a little sailboat
 	
 	
 		yeah well we don't get do a whole lot of that up here
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		just motorboat's all we
 	
 	
 		what part of Texas you from
 	
 	
 		uh Nacogdoches
 	
 	
 		okay whereabouts is that
 	
 	
 		that's between Houston and Dallas
 	
 	
 		okay all right
 	
 	
 		it's the oldest town in Texas yeah we have uh Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches so we do a lot of boating on
 	
 	
 		is that right wow that's pretty wild
 		okay so you got some lakes around you can do that on so you do some skiing and stuff or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah a little bit just got through snow skiing  yeah just came back from Denver but
 	
 	
 		yeah all right
 		yeah all right
 		yeah that sounds good yeah we've uh part of the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it it was it was heavy when we were there though i didn't see any boats there though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		not not not too many no but uh no i just got back from a weekend where we went and uh had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing it was pretty nice but uh
 		no i i have uh i had a boat last summer that i took out a catamaran that i do did a lot of sailing on and stuff that's a lot of fun but uh my parents are pretty big sailors too they're kind of into it but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh all we all we have up here mostly bass boats
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i guess it's pretty uh fishing's a pretty big thing huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum lot of lot of fishing going on up here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah all right so where about in Texas is that is that centrally located or
 	
 	
 		it's uh well you ever heard of Lufkin
 	
 	
 		uh no what what major city is nearby
 	
 	
 		Houston
 	
 	
 		okay and that's south or north of there or something
 	
 	
 		let me see Houston's north
 	
 	
 		yeah okay
 	
 	
 		Dallas is south
 	
 	
 		oh okay all right well that sounds pretty good does uh i guess the weather does that stay pretty constant there or
 	
 	
 		it's it's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons probably seventies eighties in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay well that's pretty temperate yeah that's not too bad but uh  yeah have you done uh any other boating then or
 	
 	
 		no i hadn't done any in a lately uh lately but that's all i used to have uh have a friend that owned his daddy owned a boat shop and we used to when i was in high school we used to go out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		go boating everyday just about
 	
 	
 		oh that's great yeah i
 	
 	
 		and we had a new different boat everyday
 	
 	
 		oh that's fantastic yeah i used to uh kind of be that way myself when i lived in in northwestern Florida in the panhandle i used to sail about everyday i'd work go to work
 	
 	
 		i'd like to do some sailing
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a lot of fun it's uh especially if you get a a pretty fast boat like those catamarans are pretty fast you can actually
 	
 	
 		yeah what do you if you get one like that they have somebody teach you there or they just
 	
 	
 		well actually i i've known how to sail pretty much my whole life um my my family's pretty into it and uh i took sailing lessons when i was about six and then uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		is it pretty easy
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know um just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's it's not too bad it's pretty easy to get the hang of i think and uh generally everybody i've i've known has kind of gotten into it but some people are more motorboaters you know which is fun
 	
 	
 		yeah that well that's about all we have
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah a lot of people don't don't see the excitement in sailing but then again they may ne'er may they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh that's when you really start getting into speed you know you can actually some catamarans can actually pull people behind the skiers they get so fast you know
 	
 	
 		i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		yeah they get pretty quick but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that that'd be something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i haven't i haven't personally done that but um the races i i work with a guy right now that uh  races catamarans in the summertime
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh he's pretty gassed about it he's got a good uh
 	
 	
 		what kind of what lake do y'all use
 	
 	
 		well he uh he's from Detroit so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes i think and does his sailing um for me i i go back to Orlando uh in about a month
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so down there basically just go to the coast we're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the East Coast and there's a lot of places there you can go you know
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		so uh so that's a good thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah so what do you do for a job
 	
 	
 		uh well i build transformers
 	
 	
 		oh really okay is that for TI or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no it's for Cooper Industries
 	
 	
 		okay
 		are they primarily electronic then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay well that
 	
 	
 		well they have a you know worldwide but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well well all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		great yeah how do you like it down there in Texas
 	
 	
 		it's real nice living here all my life
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh no doubt okay i've never been to Texas i've been to Oklahoma but uh that's about as far
 	
 	
 		yep
 		oh it's no Oklahoma's nothing like it
 	
 	
 		yeah okay well that's good because i didn't like Oklahoma that well
