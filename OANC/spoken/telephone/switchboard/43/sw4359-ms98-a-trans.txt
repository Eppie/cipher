 		i sure am
 	
 	
 		well i guess it sounds like you have children in the background there
 	
 	
 		yes i do
 	
 	
 		yeah what kind of child care have you found for them
 	
 	
 		uh we're military so we take him to a military day care
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i'm enrolled in a school right now a nursing school and it's just about the only thing i can afford
 	
 	
 		i see
 		uh-huh it is expensive
 	
 	
 		it is and
 	
 	
 		what what kind uh through the military what kind of prices do you pay for child care there
 	
 	
 		forty five a week
 	
 	
 		forty five a week i'm from the Bay area and uh just not even um well known schools in child care here people are paying two hundred two hundred fifty a week
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh my goodness you're kidding
 	
 	
 		no i don't know how they do it i'm i stay at home i'm a mother i stay at home with mine but i know that it's uh really expensive here
 	
 	
 		oh that is outrageous
 	
 	
 		what types of things have you looked for when you're um when you were looking in for to the child care there
 	
 	
 		well i've had several different kinds of day care
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i had a friend taking care of him and that doesn't work
 	
 	
 		it doesn't
 	
 	
 		no um your your beliefs are different and i i guess they become you you can't um make demands that you can when you're paying for it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i understand that
 	
 	
 		and i'm i'm not talking severe demands i'm talking things like i have to have you on Wednesday you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		i have an exam i must have you baby sit
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um i've had home health care that i've gotten through agencies and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well have the agencies agencies sent you some good people or
 	
 	
 		uh no no they're they're usually badly educated
 	
 	
 		no huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		probably poor English that's what you find here in the Bay area a lot of times
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes and i'm i'm just not willing to expose my child to that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean i i want him to be i want him to be stimulated and interested
 	
 	
 		yeah does does through the military does the day care do they have things like oh craft projects and learning numbers is it is it kind of like a a preschool it is
 	
 	
 		yes
 		preschool only half a day half a day is kind of geared toward those kind of things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and every week is divided like this week they're doing spring and then next week they may do kites and all week they'll have things about this
 	
 	
 		i see
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		not only they talk about kites they talk about the different colors on kites they talk cultural aspects the shapes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm or
 	
 	
 		uh you know it's wonderful
 	
 	
 		well it sounds like a good school you know i'm uh being at home with mine um if if i do go back to work it you know it worries me to death the thought of uh the child care you hear so many things about
 	
 	
 		it is frightening
 	
 	
 		oh kids being oh Shaken Child Syndrome being kids being molested i mean it's it's so hard to say say you know even with even with credentials whether you can trust them with your kids
 	
 	
 		it is Robert's day care has um close camera watch on the children you know what  i mean so it's monitored
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		plus they have um this is military so they have doctors come in and do checkups on the kids uh Texas
 	
 	
 		what state are you in
 		oh Texas my
 	
 	
 		Fort Worth um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh huh yeah
 	
 	
 		and and dentists come over child social work comes over uh family services comes over
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean it's a continual rotation of resources
 	
 	
 		oh well that sounds like a really good it sounds like a good place to to rear kids it sounds like you're in a good good situation with the military
 	
 	
 		it is and they don't change day care people at all i mean my son has been in there now a year and he has the same teacher
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		see that's
 		that's a problem with the day care here my sister-in-law has everyone i know in the Bay area except me have their kids in day care and
 	
 	
 		and you know why they keep these people they pay them more
 	
 	
 		um-hum exactly yeah the military i mean they just take care of their own i mean
 	
 	
 		they do
 	
 	
 		these mothers my my um sister-in-law's kids have been in day care and they've switched i mean from one day care to another and those poor kids
 	
 	
 		oh i know they need they need um
 	
 	
 		they don't know what's going on
 		consistence consistency
 	
 	
 		yes they need and they need this person is taking care of some of those things that i can't give my child
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now i'm in school so i'm i'm home a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh

 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he he these parent people are these women are mothering my child to a certain degree that's so important
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it is really important well you're so lucky you know that
 	
 	
 		i am
 	
 	
 		that you have such a good opportunity with um the through the military especially
 	
 	
 		very lucky i have to admit i don't know what i'd do without it
 	
 	
 		yeah my um i guess uh i was surprised to hear the prices of the day care here um
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		being two two and i'm sure even in some of the nicer i'm not i'm talking uh San Jose area the nicer areas Paolo Alto more as it gets more expensive
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		you probably pay them i would assume you pay them more just because they're overhead in the day you know their renting in these day care places
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know the overhead for the for uh you know just paying their rent in the buildings
 	
 	
 		my sister lives in Austin and she has the most wonderful home health care
