 
     		
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		okay well how about those Redskins huh
 	
 	
 		they're pretty good they um you know i can't they're not they're they're a good team you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but uh i think uh i don't know how they'll do this year they'll probably still do pretty good have you uh been keeping up on the people they've been trading or anything
 	
 	
 		do you think
 		uh yeah they hadn't i don't think they really traded anybody that i know of yet um i've i've got three kids who collect football cards
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so they uh they compete pretty vigorously for all the Redskins cards
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh actually we went to after they won the uh the uh Super Bowl
 		we actually went down to the mall in uh Washington and saw uh you know all the players down there and they had a big rally down there and so it was surprising how big those guys were i mean they they look big on the field but they're even bigger in person though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		oh yeah they
 	
 	
 		especially that guy Joe Jacobi
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he's just a guy's a monster i mean he's not inhuman
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but most of them are what over six foot aren't they
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		oh yeah they're all they're all huge guys i mean a small guy would be about six three and
 	
 	
 		and two hundred and some pounds
 	
 	
 		yeah Rypien Rypien you know for a quarterback Rypien was six i think he was six three or four and two thirty which is really big
 	
 	
 		yeah he's
 		he's one of the taller quarterbacks you know most quarterbacks are only about six foot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but but uh he's one of the taller ones
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well uh what team what team are you predicting uh will come out of the AFC next year
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		that's a good question
 	
 	
 		you think Denver will be as tough as they were this year
 	
 	
 		well they might be i haven't really heard  who they been uh trading or anything but uh
 		they're usually pretty good right up near the top and so are the Raiders so it's gonna be tough they always have a tough time with the Raiders so
 	
 	
 		yeah other than
 		yeah well i was real surprised uh that they did as well as they did last year i didn't realize that they were as good as they were and actually i thought they probably should've beaten Buffalo
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in the uh title game but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i i think what one of their problems is is they they get overconfident in the second half they get ahead in the first half and the second half they just kind of blow it you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they've done that every season every year for a while
 	
 	
 		um-hum  you think Mecklinburg is gonna hang around for another season or is uh
 	
 	
 		oh he's getting up there in the years i don't know if he's gonna stick around or not you know
 	
 	
 		yeah didn't they have a guy on there uh the wasn't a uh deaf player on there this year
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah it's that uh
 		i can't think of his name now but he's on defensive
 	
 	
 		was it Davis Davis or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah he's on defensive he's supposed to be pretty good though so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think he isn't he from Nebraska
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		what kind of college teams do you like
 	
 	
 		uh  i really don't even keep up with the college teams that much you know
 	
 	
 		Cornhuskers right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm just basically pro teams you know basically
 	
 	
 		yeah i kind of run out of steam uh until right near the the bowl games with all the colleges then i then i watch all the bowl games but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah does your wife let you watch uh plenty of football
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh course uh now i get Sunday and Monday nights Sunday afternoon and Monday nights are reserved for me
 	
 	
 		really
 		oh really that's pretty good yeah i usually uh i'm getting more and more into that habit but after ten years i still haven't been able to get into the habit of of just having that time reserved but
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		last year last year was pretty good i got she cut me a lot of slack so i could actually watch some football
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i kind of let her watch every now and then i'll let her watch her shows and then when her shows are over i'll turn it to the last quarter like on Monday nights
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		what do you think of the instant replay rule
 	
 	
 		i think some of it's pretty good and some of it's not so good you know i kind of go either way on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		what i can't believe is you know there are certain plays i guess that they don't use a instant replay on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you'll see you know the most flagrant you know foul or something else you know
 		and uh they just don't you know they don't do the instant replay and then on the other things you know a touchdown pass or something like that you know they always get out the instant replay and call backs
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's kind of
 		yeah that's just like a couple of them instant replays they did they were over their two minute limit and stuff this last year and i think that's what's gonna hurt them from having it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		but i don't know Dallas is coming up pretty good they did pretty good last year
 	
 	
 		which
 		yep
 		well yeah they really uh they really mauled the Skins
