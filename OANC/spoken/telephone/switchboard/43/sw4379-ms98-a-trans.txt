 
     		
 	
 		Cathy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh do you
 	
 	
 		so what is your uh family what do you usually do as far as budgeting
 	
 	
 		we have a very detailed budget because my husband is a finance major
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we have
 		you know we have money that we take out each month that we um you know for food and and for
 		for gas and things like that and then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for um other things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year and we budget them into what we call our needs our needs and wants list
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so um the things that like a vacation we have a vacation fund we have a fund for the things we need and then a for the things that we want
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um and we're continually putting into those you know each month how much we're going to need and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we very rarely buy anything on credit everything we buy is paid for
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband is a finance major also  and uh we kind of have the same plan um we have one credit card um every month we put um you know the same amount in for retirement
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um and we budget we're our our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby so we're budgeting um each month um an allowance for his education starting now
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		so that's in our budget every month now that's the newest addition but we too do the same thing as far as um we have a set amount we take oh one big vacation a year and then maybe you know three small vacations so we have
 		you know an exact amount that we spend on that each year
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		um we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money um instead of just writing checks for things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for um the vacation that we put in for Christmas
 	
 	
 		like you have a separate account for that then
 	
 	
 		well a lot of that um i don't know how safe it is i guess um we keep it all in a safe here at the house
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so it's actually pulled out then we keep our we have a savings account for the kidzees education that money goes into there
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		each of our children we have three children so they each have their own account
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		that money is put into each month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh does your husband deal in um stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff that does he invest in that and for long-term
 	
 	
 		he does somewhat
 		yeah he does somewhat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um we have an investment plan yeah i guess he does
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um we have really found this is the first year we've done it this way and we are really saving a lot of money
 	
 	
 		really because you're you've you've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let's see what are we going to so what goes into that that particular thing it's vacations Christmas
 	
 	
 		Christmas birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we have it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and when when we see something on sale um instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		everything's taken care of and we're finding that we even have more money than we thought
 	
 	
 		really well you know um what do you do as far as i i take it do you um run the family budget as far as uh groceries and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i do uh-huh all the money
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and how what's that
 	
 	
 		all the money is turned over to me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you have a set amount that that you spend each month or or how do you work that
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i have a set amount it's very generous and i usually have extra and so then that can go um you know either back into our checking account or i can just carry it over
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um you know there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months and certain times when that will be left over but that's completely up to me how i do that and then um because i don't work i stay home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		i do too i stay home also
 	
 	
 		and so it's kind of my money and i also get my own money to do what i want to go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we have a clothing um envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it really works out great we're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that and we're
 	
 	
 		yeah what what as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a TV or um a big item like for the house how do you have like a household
 	
 	
 		yes we have a household budget like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year and also we need a new bed and so we've got both of those budgeted and we put a certain amount in each month and we know which month we'll have enough saved to go buy those
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards the
