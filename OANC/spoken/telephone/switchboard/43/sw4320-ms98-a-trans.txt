 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so how serious is the subject of crime in your area
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well needless to say here in Washington DC  this is the war zone
 		uh DC around here stands for drug capital or death capital
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's really bad here uh for example  the uh local high school uh they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and they're starting to uh get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things
 		so it
 	
 	
 		well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here uh San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh because you end up having a lot of gangs forming uh largely around the Hispanic core
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh it seems to be that uh gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of  poverty conditions
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right that's how they uh they bind themselves together in groups i guess and uh  now the interestingly enough i don't think we have here a a lot of gangs but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		only a couple uh of not a whole large group of them but uh just a few most of them centered around uh drug territory
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so they're protecting their  economic interests i guess and uh now nowadays the latest thing i've i've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up
 		and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away  and leave you standing in front of your house
 	
 	
 		oh well that's efficient
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the uh latest thing that way there's no damage to the car or anything they just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want
 	
 	
 		they're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right  just wait for you to drive to your house you get out and they get in off they go with your car
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so it's uh i think they call it car jacking around here
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'd heard that phrase
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah that's kind of the latest thing but  oh every year in the DC area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides so it's
 		uh it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here we're from uh i'm from Ohio and my wife's from Florida so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we've just come from twenty years in the military and uh which is an entirely different environment so this is a whole new thing for  for us to to have to put up with and it's uh really scary sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah there aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right and it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school and uh of course the mayor uh of DC is having a real problem uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		trying to what do you do to to reduce crime in a in a major city like DC where it's a way of life for everybody it's uh
 		i would hate to have to wrestle with that problem i don't know what what the solution is uh there's no way they can stop the drugs and that's what's causing all the killing
 	
 	
 		well uh  there's a couple of things that i've heard uh most of them are fairly uh radical in terms of what you'd have to do uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		course the  the reason that that these kids tend to to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems seems to be just you know the the the
 		end results of of poverty and and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else because i mean you know the parents aren't making a living at anything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right and they see all their friends and neighbors uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and they're accidental parents half the time anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah and their friends are driving Mercedes and so it's actually they grow up with that as their way of life and uh i think uh to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because
 		this is the way they were raised
 	
 	
 		it's illegal but it's not wrong because all their friends do it
 	
 	
 		right  exactly so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes and they they say well it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's the law that's uh got to be changed instead of their way of life so i don't know it's
 		i'm glad it's not the kind of problem i have to   come up with an answer to because it's not easy
 	
 	
 		well i think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of of an actual solution to the problem um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the the social the other social problems wouldn't wouldn't go away
 	
 	
 		right they've always been with us
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i mean there's there's been a lot of
 		and i used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus but then the more i thought about it the more sense it made is that uh alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow
 	
 	
 		right
