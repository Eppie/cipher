 
     		
 	
 		home  because i'm
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		leaving from work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay well uh i don't know if i mentioned to you last time we talked but uh i just recently retired from the Army
 		active duty twenty years and of course when you're active duty military you are required to not only to maintain a certain level of uh weight and physical fitness
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but you're required to take a what we call a P T test physical uh physical training test uh twice a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we were constantly expected to exercise and be in shape and then we had specific standards we had to meet based on our age group
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and if you didn't pass the test  then they put you on what they called remedial P T and every morning you have to go to the company and
 		jog in formation  in which really did not prepare you for the next physical fitness test but was more a form of punishment
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well so now that you're out of that what what sort of regime do you keep up with
 	
 	
 		what do i do now well as the result of that i really got to enjoy uh long uh distance running
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i i trained quite regularly and i i raced quite often i tried to do like a ten kilometer foot race uh once a month or so
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		now that i am out i pretty much kept with it until i got a job in Virginia and i live in Maryland
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so by the time i i get up early and drive and hour to an hour and a half here
 		which is about fifty miles work all day  fifty miles back on the Capitol Beltway and of course it's dark by the time i get home and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i have to admit  that i i have fallen off uh slightly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or maybe even considerably or maybe even completely
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh so i am not doing much now which concerns me because i just had my forty ninth birthday
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i want to keep at it because i know that if you don't uh there's there's lots of problems that you can have
 	
 	
 		definitely
 	
 	
 		yeah and so uh i want to get back at it as soon as spring breaks and uh but what we have done is uh decreased considerably the amount of fat that we consume in our diet
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well i i generally play tennis two or three times a week
 	
 	
 		um uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's that's by enlarge about the only form of exercise i get but when i go out and play i generally play for two or three hours at a time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um so you have a good sustained work out
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah so that that's that's quite strenuous for that long of a period
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah yeah that's that is a long time to have  at it but that's of course uh
 		uh there's a lot of sudden fast changes in direction and i don't know does that cause you any injuries or anything
 	
 	
 		um not not generally i i uh  the few times i try and play basketball it seems like i always always sprain an ankle or twist a finger or something
 	
 	
 		no
 		uh-huh
 		right either an elbow in the eye
 	
 	
 		uh but tennis is not quite as extreme and i don't seem to have any uh injuries like that
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh the nice thing i liked about foot racing was that uh for me it was pretty much non competitive
 		uh i didn't have to worry so much about being a part of a team or anything and so i could just compete against myself or the clock or the next guy ahead of me
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh that fulfilled my urge to compete while at the same time keeping me fit
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i did uh i had the privilege of going to what the Army calls our master fitness trainer course which was uh a month long course at
 		Fort Ben Harrison Indiana and i learned a lot from that about uh the difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that sort of thing and
 		so at least from that i  i realize the importance of it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		have you noticed any changes since you've started reducing the fat content of your diet
 	
 	
 		uh
 		not so much that but i have noticed a difference because i am not exercising as much anymore in the uh in my heart rate which slowly creeps up as you get less and less fit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i haven't weighed myself in a good while  but uh uh i just had a recently had a physical and they said that my uh triglycerides and the cholesterol and all that were in in pretty good shape
 		and my wife uh was keeping real close track of it because she uh wanted to see what effect it would have on her and it she showed a significant improvement
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		through just simple things like you're going for low fat lunch meats for uh when we bring our lunches to work and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh matter of fact i've very seldom uh use uh sugar or salt either uh it takes a little getting use to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh uh skim milk is what we drink now and that took a little getting use to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh we have well at least she has noticed a significant change in her in her cholesterol and uh and triglycerides which is which is good
 	
 	
 		yeah that's encouraging
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh so she's slowly working herself into a uh a moderate fitness program
