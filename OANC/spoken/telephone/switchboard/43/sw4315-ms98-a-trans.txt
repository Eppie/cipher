 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so David uh what are the capital punishment laws down in the state of Florida
 	
 	
 		they have the electric chair i believe remember Ted Bundy
 	
 	
 		oh that's right
 	
 	
 		couple years ago they were all down there saying fry him
 	
 	
 		oh so the laws are still intact then
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they yeah they use that all the time well not all the time is
 		you know it it it's always backlogged it usually takes a guy usually a guy sits on death row for three or four years at least before they put him you know in the actual actual electric chair
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and i imagine that costs a small bundle too
 	
 	
 		yeah he always gets all these appeals and everything
 	
 	
 		go through the court process
 	
 	
 		he gets all these appeals and everything uh as far as it being a deterrent to people i don't think it's a deterrent a deterrent
 		uh i think it's i think it's more for the families more than anything the families probably get some justification out of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh as far as it deterring anybody from committing murder or something like that i don't think it really does
 	
 	
 		no but i think it does serve a valuable purpose in the sense that the victims get some sort of satisfaction the community doesn't pay for the burden of having a
 	
 	
 		the victims can
 	
 	
 		a prisoner in jail for twenty years
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you know and having to supply them with a color TV and
 		um books and education so forth
 	
 	
 		right i mean what is it how much is it a year to keep a prisoner it's like twenty thousand a year to food and clothe a prisoner
 		some ridiculous price
 	
 	
 		and i imagine it probably costs
 		a great deal amount of money to to even go through the process of trying to electrocute someone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to the court proceum i mean it tying up attorney's time uh times the court system
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know how many appeals Ted Bundy had
 		uh they just keep appealing it and appealing it to the next higher next higher you know just keeps they keep going higher and higher up
 		and uh
 		you know it does take a long time it takes money of course to do that so and it's a public defender most of the time so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well how do you feel about that do you
 		are you in favor of capital punishment as a
 	
 	
 		yeah yes i am i am in favor of it but as far as it being an actual deterrent to crime i don't think it is like i said it's mostly for the families benefit i think or the victims
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the you know the family of the victims
 		do you guys have it up there where where'd you say you were from
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm from New Hampshire
 	
 	
 		okay New Hampshire they have it up there
 	
 	
 		yeah as far as i remember we don't have it um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i know there hasn't been anyone executed up here probably in about thirty forty years which is ironic because we come from very conservative state
 		uh very strong on on punishment and crime
 		um it uh during one thing we don't really have that that much crime up here when we do have a celebrated case like Pamela Smart i don't know if you heard about that
 	
 	
 		that's the schoolteacher one
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i saw the movie about that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a case where um she's probably guilty
 		i don't think there's enough evidence there to convict her i mean to uh
 		execute her
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think if because once you execute someone the the the decision the decision is final you can't really reverse the process um
 	
 	
 		well that is the bad thing about it and i'm i'm sure that back in the old days they
 		they put to death a couple innocent ones during the process but they're but they're uh opinion was well if you got few few innocent people have to die to protect the majority then that's okay you know i don't i don't necessarily agree with that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i don't agree with that either i think if you
 		kill someone who's innocent that's uh
 	
 	
 		it screwed up the whole thing in my opinion yeah i agree with you there
 	
 	
 		somebody you can't even live with if they
 		you you really need to you know case where John Hinkley tried to assassinate the President uh
 	
 	
 		that's pretty obvious that's open and shut isn't it
 	
 	
 		right and if he had succeeded uh uh without a doubt he should be executed executed
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		uh whether he's insane or not
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		same thing with Dahlmer i mean he killed seventeen people
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh it's it's a shame that we're gonna have to pay for him
 	
 	
 		now
 		in his case now is that that's Minnesota right
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		is that Minnesota
 	
 	
 		i think  uh Michigan or somewhere somewhere around there
 	
 	
 		or Wisconsin or ah maybe it's Wisconsin
 		yeah they they might have capital punishment the thing with people like that they like to take and study them put them in jail and do studies on them like that so that's they can try to get a profile of his personality i think
 		you know and
 		i guess in states where they don't have capital punishment that's the kind of stuff they do but i think in his case they will put him to death because all the all the kids you know all the families and stuff aren't going to tolerate it
 	
 	
 		yeah but i thought he he received his sentence um
 		remember maybe what the what the final turnout was
 	
 	
 		what is the final uh is he still going to trial for that
 	
 	
 		i thought he went to rehabilitation rehabilitation mean they they were going to put him in
 		rehabilitation for a few years then prison for the rest of his life
 	
 	
 		that's right because he's definitely insane i think they proved that he was insane and maybe that's
 		maybe that was uh what got him off or made him uh not get the death penalty because they can prove that he's insane then i i don't think you get the death penalty
 		but the the but the uh prosecution was trying to uh
 		say that he was sane when he committed them so they could but they they were going for the death penalty i think that's what they were trying to uh i mean the they knew he did it that he was guilty it was just a matter of was he going to get the death penalty or life in prison
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah i think the families wanted him to get death
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's a a case where there really needs to be some change in the laws to allow for flexibility i think if one person kills another person out of
