 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		been about ten years since i graduated from high school i got a GED i was a drop out up until that point
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh as my memory serves me school was not that um
 		didn't achieve it's goals as being an educational institution very well and i would suppose that the trend in government is for things to get worse kind of like uh chaos and regular deterioration so i don't not having seen anything to
 		change my mind i would assume it's gotten worse in the meantime
 	
 	
 		yeah i graduated about the same time you did and um i graduated early only and i was lucky because i don't think i would have graduated at all
 		i was skipping and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		up to that point and i just happened to have enough credit hours so i could get out
 	
 	
 		yeah i had really reached the point where i'd quit going entirely i was tired of it was off working somewhere
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there was almost no challenge to it at all
 	
 	
 		i was on the college track doing all the classes and i was done
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um
 	
 	
 		it was boring
 		they weren't interested
 	
 	
 		yeah i had started in that uh that track but just got sick of it and turned into a juvenile delinquent instead
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		went off and joined the military and then uh came back to college it just the material was so repetitive it was stuff we already seen probably half a
 		who knows how many times before and it was just presented so dryly and i suppose that if um if you're going to pay teachers the salary that they're paid that's that's the level of education that's going to be presented
 	
 	
 		that's true we have to pay our teachers more and give them more incentive to interest the children
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um yeah i really  i really believe the same thing i mean here i am now just now  finishing up college it took me that long to get interested to go back
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know and but i find college a whole different ball game
 	
 	
 		yeah absolutely
 		it's a stress test
 	
 	
 		it is but it's so stimulating i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		those teachers really are at least mine of course i'm in nursing so
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ours is a lot of life threatening but um
 		i it it isn't i i don't miss classes i love it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i agree it's a whole another class of everything the level of education the uh excitement and the the interesting instructors their level of understanding the material everything's different
 	
 	
 		maybe we ought to um
 		offer this kind of enrichment to our high school students
 	
 	
 		now how would you recommend doing that
 	
 	
 		well
 		if somehow we could make give them a certain amount of independence
 		cause that's part of college
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		right um and then simply say this is up to you to achieve this
 	
 	
 		sounds a lot like the um what do they call let's see uh
 		fire fox Foxfire method
 	
 	
 		i haven't heard about that
 	
 	
 		that's the one where uh some guy it's here in Georgia north Georgia several years ago ten twenty years ago
 		walked into a class room and they the students retained command and he just kind of threw up his hands and said basically do what you want to do
 		and developed this uh program where the students pretty much did what they wanted to do
 		the teacher was just there to kindly loosely kind of loosely guide them um along and to make sure that they weren't getting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		getting off into weird senseless subject areas and stuff like that and i think there was some kind of sociology class along the lines of um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what did they do they went out and collected stories and culture of the area in southern Appalachian uh mountains
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and published a bunch of books and the guy's real famous now and in fact i just read recently that some school here in north Georgia decided to completely um adopt the Foxfire method all the classes are that way
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and they say that the results are just tremendous it's a whole another um magnitude of improvement over regular public schools
 	
 	
 		
  
 		see and that and it works
 	
 	
 		yeah i wish there had been something like that years ago when we were younger
 	
 	
 		me too i wish they had computers
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they've made a an amazing change
 	
 	
 		i think i think elementary school is educational is stimulating for children and i think we lose them somewhere
 		between junior high and high school
 	
 	
 		a friend here in town just recently helped a um third grader with his science fair project  and he was describing some of the interaction
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh between the the teachers there and the students and the teachers there and himself and other people like him
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and was really disturbed with the uh
 		mentality of the people there they treated him like uh he was one of the kids you know they had their little domain
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i remember he brought up a story about how he needed a desk to set up the  uh the science fair project that he and this other guy worked on
 		and they couldn't find one anywhere and they found one in a room and the instructor there was really possessive of it and wouldn't let him use it
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well then that goes to maybe not having the funds for things
