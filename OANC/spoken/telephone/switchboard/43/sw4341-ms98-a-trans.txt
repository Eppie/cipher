 		uh it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime but i don't think that it really actually does that i don't think it deters anybody because
 		most of the time crimes are uh are committed without without any thought to the consequences and they don't think that uh stop and think and say well maybe i shouldn't do this uh because uh
 		i might get the gas chamber or something like that they worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it
 		and uh how about you
 	
 	
 		well i think that in some cases it is warranted especially
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i do too yep
 	
 	
 		and i don't i think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah you still have to do it i i
 	
 	
 		i mean i mean i'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer or
 	
 	
 		um-hum so you're in you're in favor of capital punishment then
 	
 	
 		well for some things i think for serial murderer it is warranted because if a person
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		who
 		would do something like that in cold blood
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society
 	
 	
 		i mean you can't
 		guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison
 	
 	
 		right and then do it all over again um-hum
 	
 	
 		and do it again and i don't think that that rehabilitation is effective
 	
 	
 		right
 		have to agree with you and i'm kind of in in favor of capital punishment also i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes but
 		i tend to agree with you that uh we should have it  i just i don't know that it's always effective  but i guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it it's it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to
 		determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime uh
 	
 	
 		but then you know i think that that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment you know just like for example um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them and i don't think that would really warrant capital punishment
 	
 	
 		um-hum right um-hum
 		um-hum huh do you think they should be punished at all or uh  like go to prison uh because they're not really a danger to society it was almost really self defense isn't it in a case like that
 	
 	
 		um it is to a certain extent but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think
 		i don't know because
 	
 	
 		i know they put uh put them in jail sometimes i guess uh
 	
 	
 		i think in certain and it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um um-hum you know now i wonder what you think about this and uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it but uh it used to be a long time ago i guess in Biblical times  when they had punishment
 		if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment so if somebody killed somebody in your family  then you had the right
 		to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person
 		and i know that uh if somebody had done something to my family i would feel that i had the right to to get revenge on them and uh  but i i don't think that's done much anywhere  that's kind of drastic punishment
 	
 	
 		well i think that would be kind of drastic punishment
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		might make you feel better but
 	
 	
 		but one thing i think that if
 		there is a chance for rehabilitation
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then that chance should should be investigated
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but like i said if if someone is is just pathologically
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh right because they are a danger to everybody else huh that's interesting
 		i have to uh agree with that there's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that uh that aren't really a danger to society huh and uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		and a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison
 	
 	
 		right
 		right probably more of them then the other way around huh interesting i don't i don't not sure i i'm in Washington D C or at least very close to it i'm not sure what kind of uh capital punishment we have here
 	
 	
 		well i know in North Carolina we do have capital punishment and i'm really i'm from South Carolina
 	
 	
 		um-hum
