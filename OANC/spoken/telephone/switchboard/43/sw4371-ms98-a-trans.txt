 
     		
 	
 		so Rick you thinking about buying a new car
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		yeah i am uh a truck
 	
 	
 		a truck uh Japanese or American
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think i'm going to buy American this time
 	
 	
 		you you this time you had a you Japanese
 	
 	
 		yeah i got a yeah we got a Toyota two of them actually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they uh they've always been real good cars but it's just uh
 	
 	
 		they rust
 	
 	
 		well i actually haven't had any problem with them at all but um i i think it's probably pretty important to uh to buy American i've i'm coming to that conclusion
 	
 	
 		you know i it's like i'm i've been driving like foreign cars now for for years and i i'm actually thinking about buying a new car i i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm sitting i'm sitting here right now it's like my with a thousand dollars worth of repairs on my car  and uh i'm thinking about buying an American car also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i i think they're to the point now where they're just they're just as good as those foreign cars
 	
 	
 		i yeah i do too i i think uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've i've had pickup trucks before and i've had uh Chevrolets and they were pretty good but i i think uh Ford um is is pretty much focusing on quality
 	
 	
 		that
 		that's the best uh actually uh a guy that like's in next office he uh he's thinking about buying a truck and he's looking at an F one fifty and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he he he one thing that you find about the about the the F one fifties is that uh
 		they are every every the word is out that they are like the best truck uh especially like if you want to get like you know heavier than a mini pick up and uh they weren't cutting too many deals
 	
 	
 		is that right yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with uh with the prices on the F one fifties especially especially like in the in the four wheel drive models
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh i i i guess like all these people can't be that wrong you know in terms uh of uh of how they how they are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i was looking in uh
 		it was uh i i forget the name of the magazine used to be Changing Times sort of like a Consumer Reports magazine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they were saying that Ford Ranger was the number one selling truck counting all
 	
 	
 		now the Ranger is that the Ranger is below the one fifty it's like a it's like a three quarter ton truck
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		yeah something like i believe something like that
 	
 	
 		and was is and the and the F one fifty is a ton and a half or or i'm not sure where they sit
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm not sure i i i kind of think i'd like to go with uh something around a a one fifty i don't want a full size but i don't want uh one of those little uh mini trucks either
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		besides i probably would look at something uh maybe a a V six
 	
 	
 		yep you geing to get a King Cab
 	
 	
 		you know  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that that  know do you have any any kids or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got one little girl and and and a set of golf clubs so
 	
 	
 		oh there you go yeah you you you  you got to have you got to have just that extra space
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah that's it
 	
 	
 		it yeah
 		the uh the it's a a buddy of mine he just he just bought a truck and uh
 		and and it was a thing was like it would there was no thought whatsoever about not getting the extra size cab even though you can't really use use that back area for a seat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know unless you're some like some kind of contortionist
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		you just need it because you do carry you do carry stuff that you you don't want to like just throw in the bed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i kind of like the looks of a short bed but or the short cab but but uh you know like i say just you you just really need the extra space
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		either unless you have some sort of a cab you know  cover or something but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you'd get air-conditioning because  you're down there it's pretty hot right
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that uh
 	
 	
 		although uh i i notice you you you said rust right before that that we don't have that much problem down here but i know y'all have it up there i guess they salt the roads and
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh boy i'll tell you that's like that's the number one car killer up here is that is the is the rust you know it's like you're you're constantly car taking
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		about every other every about every month during the winter you know the smart thing to do is to go to like one of those uh
 		drive in car washes do it yourself and just fire a bunch of water underneath underneath you know up into your rocker panels and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh it just like i said it it just eats the cars like right alive
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess i i as as was working with some people from Buffalo here recently or actually it was a couple years ago but
 		they were they were saying you know a lot of people up there they got a winter car and then a summer car you know
 	
 	
 		that my neighbor's in the exact same situation situation it's like he uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he has he has two cars one of them is a is a a Mitsubishi you know uh uh i don't know what is a Starion or it's one of those hot cars and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's like come come November when the roads like start to get you know to get nasty the Starion goes like into the into the garage then he closes it and locks it and then he
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he throws he he pull he throws a tarp off of this beater that he's got in the backyard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		out comes the sixty eight Nova
 	
 	
 		and i think it's a it's actually like a
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's like an eighty two no no yeah it's like an eighty two Toyota Corolla you know
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and this guy goes through this like role you know this revert Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde revert
