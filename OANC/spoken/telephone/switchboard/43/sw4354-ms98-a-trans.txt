 
     		
 	
 		what do you think on uh on a scale of one to ten where would you rate yourself on on gun control
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 		one being maximum control or minimal control
 	
 	
 		most and ten being no restrictions at all
 	
 	
 		that well i guess  probably somewhere in the middle i've uh mixed feelings about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i think i'd be be somewhere around a four or five myself and yeah it  it seems to me like there's there's
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's not it's not fair to just kind of do everything all the same with all guns because they're not all the same you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		like hand guns and guns uh assault rifles i think are a little bit different than rifles and shotguns
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well um i ours my families from uh south Georgia and you know they hunt quite a bit so i i really don't you know guns just something that you have  down there and uh
 		uh so i i tend to agree on that you know but uh
 		assault rifles you know that's that's  made to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		made to kill somebody you know
 	
 	
 		and you don't need three hundred rounds a minute to to get hold of a deer and
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah so yeah i feel
 	
 	
 		and if you did it really wouldn't be worth eating so  you know
 	
 	
 		yeah right or cleaning
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		uh i i've heard some
 		uh talk about you know having like a three day waiting period or something uh if you to try to buy a firearm or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i don't i don't have a problem with that you know i think if you've got a if you've got a  history of uh of violent crimes or something then you certainly don't need a
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that makes sense that that makes a lot of sense i don't see uh
 	
 	
 		hand gun
 	
 	
 		i mean it's not like you're gonna go hey i'll go hunting today
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		and and usually if you're gonna go hunting it's pretty early in the morning anyway and the store is not gonna be open so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		a three day waiting period makes perfect sense to me  i guess the only real questions then is um is gun control does it does it work i mean can you enforce it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well  uh i think it it
 		i mean if you can if you're gonna commit some violent crime and you go and you can get a gun at your leisure then
 		uh to to restrict it would certainly cut down on on that but
 		you know that people you can get a gun fairly easily i would think i mean i i feel like i could get a gun in an hour if i had to you know so uh obviously it's not gonna
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh get rid of all all of your um illegal weapons out there or or dangerous you know get dangerous weapons out of people's hands but  uh i think it'd help some
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't
 		i guess i mean the only thing that i worry i question is i mean i think if if it was really easy to enforce that it it would be great the only thing that uh that would worry me about it
 		is that the only real way that i know to enforce it is if someone commits a crime while having a weapon that's not registered you can tag on a couple of extra years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but as it is now you put someone in prison and they're out in you know one fifth the time they were sentenced to anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah no time
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i mean they're not they're not even staying in prison without the extra years on there much less i don't think they'd be staying any longer with extra years tagged on there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah i don't i don't really think uh i mean i think gun control uh to some extent can could help crime situations but  uh i think
 		i personally my personal belief is you know as you commit a crime you know you should be punished and and  and if you know you are not going to get punished or very little punishment then there's no reason not to
 	
 	
 		um-hum i think you might've had the i i guess i mean i'm that's got to be part of gun control but i like the idea of the uh the waiting period because
 		i don't think that i mean i really think that if someone wants to get a gun to commit a crime they're gonna get a gun but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if someone is just like all hot and bothered and and ready to go out and and and get someone just because they're all charged up emotionally
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		that a three day waiting period you're not gonna stay that angry for that long
 	
 	
 		yeah usually not
 	
 	
 		least i'm not
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i agree at least you have a little bit of time to think about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i think i don't know that accounts for at least some of the shootings that go on so in the heat of the moment just go out and buy a gun right then and
 	
 	
 		yeah
