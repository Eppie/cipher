 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i guess there's a lot of uh complex issues here some of which are moral and some are um
 		
 
 		more logistical as to the merits capital punishment
 		i suppose the uh the moral ones are
 		are the more nebulous when it comes to trying to discuss and the logistic ones i guess are
 		uh i suppose a reasonable default on um issues the moral issue would be just let everybody live and not
 		um not try and make those kind of judgmental errors but that goes and affects the logistical ones in that
 		now you have to care for somebody that you otherwise wouldn't have to i suppose that might actually be a uh pretty rude way of rude way of looking at it though
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i guess it has to do with uh what anger revenge
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh what human life is worth and whether or not you can rehabilitate somebody
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah those are all good ones i suppose uh another one is um if you do decide that it's uh you know you want to do this
 		is somebody capable of making the judgment rationally you know do we have the um
 		do we really have that ability to go out and judge somebody's crime all these circumstances and other stuff and weigh it
 	
 	
 		you mean do we have the right or are you talking logistical here
 	
 	
 		can we really do it are we are we that good that we can really do it it's like uh like nuclear power plants you know it's a great idea
 		but logistically we just haven't been able to get our act together well enough to
 	
 	
 		well that i think you can take that nice simple nice simple  nice problematical logistical argument and say well are you morally able to make a mistake
 		you know what what is uh is it all right to guess wrong once in a while
 	
 	
 		um yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and if it's if it's not acceptable to ever make a mistake you know ever sentence somebody to death that shouldn't be
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		then uh you can't use the death penalty
 	
 	
 		yeah or shouldn't
 	
 	
 		well yeah okay
 	
 	
 		shouldn't be using it
 		there's a lot of can'ts and shouldn'ts and don'ts and stuff that seem to be pretty well ignored these days
 		um
 	
 	
 		so what are they doing down in uh Georgia
 	
 	
 		well Evan uh i suppose they do have the death penalty down here i don't know if um if they executed anybody on it recently i don't think so
 		uh i don't know you know it's gotten to the point where
 		something like that if i see it in the paper or hear about it it's just kind of like in one ear and out the other
 		some state recently executed somebody where was that Texas
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 		i haven't heard about any lately
 		uh Florida was doing a few weren't they
 	
 	
 		yeah what kind of crimes is it that they usually do this for murders big murders
 	
 	
 		uh yeah usual serial killers or multiple murders like if uh you know somebody kills a family or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah what did they uh give Jeffrey Dahlmer
 		what did they do to him
 	
 	
 		didn't they lock him away in a uh psychological ward
 	
 	
 		uh that would make too much sense
 	
 	
 		no no they didn't they didn't they just let sent him to prison that's right
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah seemed to me it was a relatively senseless thing to do with somebody that was so rare
 		something kind of wasteful
 		not that um
 		not that we need more or anything like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that was a bizarre case
 		and i guess are they did the government federal government pass some recent um
 		regulation something about for certain certain crimes uh if um there's a gun involved or something like that the death penalty is automatic or is there something like that out there
 	
 	
 		uh well there's something like that and there's always proposals to uh make punishment nastier
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know or whenever somebody gets off lightly somebody visible gets off lightly they you know the judge has what like a range of sentences he can give like three to ten
 	
 	
 		yeah there's some real
 		yeah
 		they're they're often does seem to be backlash against light things
 	
 	
 		and he gets the
 	
 	
 		i guess occasionally there's some about harsh stuff one harsh sentence that i kind of liked was uh Jim Bakker getting forty five years
 		that's that seemed like justice but it seems they reevaluated his sentence or resentenced him or something like that i don't know if they changed it
 	
 	
 		yeah there's a general impression that uh these snakes get off eventually
 		uh like Klaus Von Bulow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		who will i guess
