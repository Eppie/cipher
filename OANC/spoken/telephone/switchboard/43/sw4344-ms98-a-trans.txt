 
     		
 	
 		what well what kind of job do you have
 	
 	
 		well right now i'm just working um temporary just for a week or so at a uh communication center
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so basically i wear um i can wear casual dress or casual pants
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i don't really dress up a whole bunch but
 	
 	
 		is is that because you're a student or oh
 	
 	
 		no um i'm i've just been at home for a while and so i'm
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay
 	
 	
 		just
 	
 	
 		well i'm a student that's why i was asking and uh i um
 	
 	
 		oh  that
 	
 	
 		i haven't been working this semester
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i don't really have uh  much to say about that but i do work in the hospitals once a week um i don't get
 	
 	
 		oh they have really strict clothing rules don't they
 	
 	
 		yeah i have i wear a uniform a nursing uniform
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i don't really have much choice
 	
 	
 		yeah i went to school with some nurses and the cost of those was kind of expensive i thought
 	
 	
 		yeah they they tend to be pretty expensive
 	
 	
 		they look like they'd last a while
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah they should uh unless you just buy a few and wear keep wearing those all the time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's what i do
 	
 	
 		and yeah and and people tend to use bleach on them because you know you want them to stay white and that kind of deteriorates it a little bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		disinfectant
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um  i'm hoping mine my one uniform will last me a long time until i have to start working more days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		there's not much of a selection at least in my price range like styles or things so
 	
 	
 		yeah they seem to all be all the uniforms even like in the fast food and everything i mean they're the it's just different colors it seems like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they're all kind of alike
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		i i used to work in a dentist office and there i had to dress up and
 	
 	
 		oh you did
 	
 	
 		yeah and i usually wore a dress most of the time or dress pants and
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		that gets expensive  yeah
 	
 	
 		that sure does yeah were you a receptionist oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i mean sometimes i think it's cheaper to stay home than because at home i just wear like joggers or Levi's or you know whatever comfortable and i don't care what people think
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely
 		uh-huh that sounds good
 		
 
 		right also the shoes are expensive that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and to find ones that are comfortable you really have to pay
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really tough before i went back to school i worked as a uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what do you call it can't even remember it's been so long  um office administrator or whatever it one of those titles
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh wow
 		like an office manager like
 	
 	
 		uh sort of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it was more a more of a casual uh atmosphere but i still
 		wore dresses and things like that so i mean it was for a uh nonprofit organization
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well you always try to look professional but it's just
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know i always have a hard time between comfort and
 		looking nice because when you're working all day sometimes you i don't know comfort seems to come first
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i agree i i really  i totally agree i have a friend that has a knack for looking really stylish but always comfortable
 	
 	
 		i
 		uh-huh
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		yeah she's really good at doing that
 	
 	
 		because i've seen a lot of people that always look really hot but i'd never i could never make it through a day wearing what they're wearing you know i was like how did you fit in that but and the high heels i i don't know i guess i'm just wacky
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah well she she you don't have to wear high heels to look good
 	
 	
 		
  
 		that's true that is
 	
 	
 		yeah she never wore high she's an engineer and she never yeah she never wore high heels just
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		flats and low low heels
 	
 	
 		and a longer skirt see that's what i like yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum more of a classic look yeah see that doesn't have to be uncomfortable
 	
 	
 		i think that looks nice it looks so much more natural
 	
 	
 		yeah but you're right i think those things tend to be more expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah well and quality because i don't know i try to find find things that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um even if i'm not working that i can wear or else that i know will last you know not just for this year it'll be out of style or something and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		those usually cost a little bit but sometimes in the long run i'm sure they're cheaper
 	
 	
 		yeah because um also you tend to those things don't go out of style so much and uh i find
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		some of the fads
 	
 	
 		right yeah and since i'm a student i never buy fad clothes because i know they'll be out of style the next season and then i have to go buy more  so i just don't buy any
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i
 		where i went to school though a lot at college a lot of them i mean i mean i've never been one to feel
 		pressured into wearing styles just because everyone else is but i couldn't believe how some of the college people dress because you know i always think of low income i at least i was low income going to school you know and it was like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		i know
