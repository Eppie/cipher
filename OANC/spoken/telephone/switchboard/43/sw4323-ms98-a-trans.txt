 
     		
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay so what kind of car do you want to buy next
 	
 	
 		uh well i don't that's a tough decision um at the moment i probably should go for something that's that's more on the practical side of things
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um so i don't know right now i drive a uh Volkswagen Golf GTI
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and that's a great little car for me because it's it's fun to drive plus you can fold the backseats down and and it's got a lot of storage room
 	
 	
 		well do you have children are you married
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh i'm single
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i am um divorced just just like in three days i'll be divorced and i have two little girls and um i have a Pontiac six thousand
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um that's worn out and and if i would have had the money to go buy a car i would probably get a Toyota just because
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		really
 	
 	
 		that's what everybody says i should get when i get a car is a Toyota they supposed to just last forever you know and um if i had my choice i'd want a minivan
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh probably a Chrysler
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know Plymouth Voyager one of them other ones you know one of them that's what i would want  lots of room so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right
 	
 	
 		have room for them children to you know move around and not get cramped up and fuss you know so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		plenty of room for all the toys and everything
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i would probably you know want something with really good gas mileage because i'm cheap  you know so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that would probably be my choices two choices
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i always try and go for something a little more sporty just because i don't have the
 	
 	
 		well you're single and you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't have the family to worry about it's just me selfish me
 	
 	
 		yeah have them women look at you in that sports car driving  oh goodness
 	
 	
 		well true true  i'm sure it doesn't hurt
 		but uh yeah actually um i don't know you know that brings up the the question about uh American versus imports
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know there's a lot of people saying buy American again you know but obviously uh neither of us would if we uh  had the option um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no i wouldn't no i wouldn't
 	
 	
 		i guess yours is based on previous experience then maybe
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we had a Honda Accord
 		and um an older one it was a eighty one and um it just you know lasted forever it was a really good car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um so i like them
 		but um i have a couple of friends that have Toyotas and and they have a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand miles and not a thing goes wrong with them
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		get great gas mileage and they still just run run run and i've got this poor pitiful Pontiac and thing breaks down every other day so you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't know it's it's it's interesting um
 		you know i don't
 	
 	
 		so if you were married and had children what would you want to buy
 	
 	
 		oh jeez if i was married and had children uh do i have a budget or not
 	
 	
 		of course you have a budget you're married and have children
 		it depends are you a doctor or a lawyer then you don't have a budget or you just have a bigger one
 	
 	
 		yeah no no not yet
 		
 
 		yeah yeah i guess everyone has a budget more or less um yeah i don't i don't know that's a good question um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i actually really like uh Jeep Cherokees uh-huh
 	
 	
 		ooh i do too i like them
 	
 	
 		yeah they're the problem is they're pretty expensive um
 	
 	
 		they are well all  just about everything is expensive now i mean you know the minivans are way on up there you know they're real expensive and
 	
 	
 		true
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you know
 	
 	
 		yeah but i don't know a a a Cherokee would be nice uh or or a Wagoneer uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or gosh i don't know uh
 		station wagon of some sort you know that that be an an alternative i'm i'm not too sold on the minivan idea uh
 	
 	
 		you don't you don't like them
 	
 	
 		well you know i've never driven one so i can't really criticize them fairly but
 	
 	
 		i like riding in them
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		i love them i think they're just great two of my friends have them and they're great they're i really like them
 	
 	
 		they uh
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um i rode my one of my friends has a Dodge Caravan and one has a one had a Plymouth Voyager and i liked the Plymouth Voyager the best
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know it was a little bit fancier
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know  they haven't had a bit of problem with them
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		they ride ride real smooth and the kids have room and
 		you know i like them
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah um i don't know i always like to to look for something a little with a little more power that's that's that's my main complaint against um like Toyota is because i think they always under power their cars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do they
 	
 	
 		yeah um you know i mean they're they're great if if you're really looking for maximum uh
