 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay you go first
 	
 	
 		well i have um two kids i have one seven and one five and um they're in a public school here in Tyler and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm happy with it i'm happy with their school it's great good teachers good curriculum
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um they learn a lot they have no problems um but i do live in the better
 		and well in the best part of the city though i live in you know the real richy part i guess i'm not but everybody around me is and um but the i have friends that live in the other the
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		less fortunate or whatever you wanna call it part of town and their schools are kind of rundown and
 		um older and they don't really
 		offer as much i don't know as uh the school that my girls are in i don't really think that's fair you know um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you know i'm happy with what they're in so
 		go ahead
 	
 	
 		well yeah it it's it's pretty much what i was  going to say is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i grew up in New York and um the place or not New York City upstate New York
 	
 	
 		wow
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i went to uh the City of Rochester School District and so a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but
 		the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that would result in some um could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs
 		and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many you know the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked there wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when i was a senior as some other schools had
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it it so i you know i think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of
 		of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or they'll move farther away  to get better schools so you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of
 	
 	
 		right
 		also um the the family environment
 		you know you can come to south Tyler where i live and you have got room mothers in every room you've got art mothers you've got every every holiday there's parties
 		all the kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something you can go to north Tyler to the schools and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know um
 		that has a a whole lot to do with it you know as far as their learning i mean if the parents aren't um
 		you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know they really don't have much of a chance at all and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		why is that
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		why is that
 	
 	
 		oh  why are you  you just they just don't i mean i mean i'm i'm up there at my kid's school
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know what they're learning and if they're up i call and find out you know is she having problems does she need help with anything no she's doing fine okay you know um
 		and i i know kids that their parents could really give a rip and the kids are not motivated
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		they have no motivation from home so they just go to school and you know eh you know i'll get through the day and um bring homework home and there's nobody to to sit them down and say you're going to do this
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um just you know they they take a notion to do it they do and um that doesn't work either you know they have to have guidance and um they can't just have it at school and then come home and there's nothing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah  yeah i know that that that was a big factor for me i ended up coming out of of the public school system very well you know with very good education
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice and i think the difference for me was that my parents were
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they were definitely they were always there was like well yeah of course you're going to study and do well i mean that's the way of course are you know
