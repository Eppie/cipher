 
     		
 	
 		so have you heard about Saturns
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i've heard some about Saturns i don't know
 		a lot about them i haven't been over uh to a dealer to look at them although i did see something in tonight's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the i guess the Japanese cars
 	
 	
 		ooh that's great actually that's kind of the type of car that i i'm thinking about
 		we might get Saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a a Saturn dealer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah this this offshoot of GM
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh supposedly they've got great customer
 		
 
 		satisfaction from what things i've heard
 	
 	
 		hm yeah i've heard a lot of people like them uh
 		yeah i don't know whether whether i would buy Saturn or not at this point i'm kind of
 		my card and uh
 		desires tend to be pretty picky and so uh
 	
 	
 		well like what
 	
 	
 		well let's see i like i like cars that are
 		designed with with human beings in mind and that's not just the driver and the passenger but that's the person whose working on it because i do almost almost all my own maintenance
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		those types of things and i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh
 		finding a car car anymore that's that's fairly easy for me to work on it just not very easy it's not very
 		almost unlikely at this point
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got a sixty five Mustang and i and i do the work on most of the work on that myself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ooh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and when i look at modern cars and stuff like  i just say i will never do that with the modern cars it's not worth my time you can't get in there you can't do anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's so complicated too i look at it and i say boy you know i i'd have to almost
 		go take a class or something like that
 	
 	
 		well i've got an eighty three Saab
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i find that for a normal you know everyday things it's really very easy to work on and so uh
 		now i'm kind of spoiled i used to have an old uh Chevy uh with a three fifty in it and uh i really liked working on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		ah cause it was pretty easy too it was about a nineteen seventy
 		so i'm kind of uh
 		biased in that and you know i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's kind of that's that's probably one thing i'd look at i think another thing i'd look at is safety
 	
 	
 		yeah that's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about actually the car
 		one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety one Ford Taurus because they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags
 	
 	
 		hm
 		that's a real nice car i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've driven some uh
 		Tauruses over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips uh as rental cars and i've always been very impressed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		with the Tauruses it's a really nice car i think it's very
 		it's a stylish car both inside and out it's comfortable to drive
 		uh
 		reasonable performance and this is out in California  where where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i've been real impressed with that you you and i didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now
 	
 	
 		ninety yep then or excuse me the ninety two's the ninety two's had dual air bags this newest model you could get them with duals
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i think that
 		that's excellent that's excellent because
 	
 	
 		yeah but the thing is is that it's twenty thousand dollars actually my my wife and i are actually thinking contemplating buying a new car in the next
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		year and a half or so so we're actually been looking around and thinking about things we'd like to get like a
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know what do you call it a dealer return type thing on a ninety two and ninety three or something like that you know year old ninety two or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		sure
 	
 	
 		see if we can
 	
 	
 		those are yeah that that'd be a good deal to go with
 	
 	
 		and the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too because they looked really nice
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um-hum what do you what do you looking for in in those what attracts what attracts you to the Saturns or or or of course we've already talked you know the Taurus is safe but what what kind of things are you looking for
 	
 	
 		well the the Saturns you can get air bags in them i don't think you can get dual side air bags but one of the things the two things that i'm really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'd say the most important thing is a car that's not gonna fall apart that doesn't have problems
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you set down you look at consumer reports we been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the US auto
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		makers when you do that because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have and
 		and the two cars that apparently are close to that that actually have high reliability the Taurus is one of the highest US cars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the other one is are the Saturns
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so those two things and then you know
 		we kind of want a four door
 	
 	
 		okay
