 
     		
 	
 		so how do you uh so it so it sounds like you've got a television going on there so i can assume that you probably watch TV news is that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i almost never watch TV news  i get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio
 	
 	
 		really wow
 		
 
 		uh what what station do you listen to
 	
 	
 		uh it's a local radio station it's called uh
 		KLIF cliff
 	
 	
 		cliff i see so um it's not affiliated with anything is it not not a network station okay yeah because i i listen to uh public radio a lot and they have
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		they have KCRW which i i i saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable TV outlet i guess they're getting a little getting a little feisty now
 	
 	
 		well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and occasionally in the morning i'll pick up something like uh CNN or that but i hate watching the like ten o'clock news or
 	
 	
 		yeah so you have a paper or something or
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a local well we have uh Dallas Morning News which is the big paper in Dallas we read it i read it pretty much
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		from cover to cover
 	
 	
 		how do you like it it's been  it's been a while since i read the Dallas news i uh
 		fact last time i read the Dallas Dallas news i was in Arkansas
 		uh
 	
 	
 		the Times Herald went out of business here
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one Fort Worth newspaper
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that must be pretty bad
 		so
 		how did that happen anyway
 	
 	
 		uh financial trouble
 	
 	
 		no not how i mean when did it when did they  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh when did it happen
 		i guess they closed down about three months ago
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so how do you keep up
 	
 	
 		oh me i um  good grief i read the Times Los Angeles Times there's uh
 		quite a task if you've ever run into one they're uh specially
 	
 	
 		yes they're very voluminous
 	
 	
 		yeah they're thick um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if there's something you want to know it's it's in the Times and then in in detail
 		um
 		they uh we we used to have two papers here in town and then the Herald Examiner collapsed about two years ago because of
 		oh i don't know just just nobody was buying it really
 	
 	
 		so there really is only one major LA newspaper now
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty much um there used to be in fact i think there still is the uh the Daily News which runs out of the San Fernando Valley
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and um they're not bad as far as a uh you know as far as a local paper goes in fact it was kind of weird because i met the uh i met the i met the editor
 		uh while i was on uh while i was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff he was a really cool guy
 		um you know went to Columbia University and all this stuff
 		and uh it's it's a pretty good paper but um you know it's not the it's not the Times
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		although i see you know i'm starting to see some of their um there's there's a daily new
 		uh news rack right around the corner from where i live which means that they're they're expanding i guess
 		but uh and and occasionally i i pick up like Time magazine or something i think uh if they've got an interesting lead story but
 		you know it's i i don't have time
 	
 	
 		i used to read Time magazine a lot but i don't read it much anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's kind of a problem for them there's a lot of people who fall into that category
 	
 	
 		and then we have a local rag here in town that i pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i see
 	
 	
 		because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the Dallas Morning News
 	
 	
 		yeah  the big dailies don't like to don't like to step much out of their uh out of their home turf i have to admit the Times is kind of provincial too
 		it's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover
 	
 	
 		now they have started here running a three day or three times a week Plano section
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano
 		but it's still not an awful lot of news
 	
 	
 		yeah i know
 		i uh
 		it was it was a big discovery when when the Times when the Times found out there was a place called Orange County
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean  the way they i mean the way they've been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed shots to go south of the LA county border
 	
 	
 		oh i would imagine in uh you know  in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs suburbs and
 		of course they tend to cover the county and we're not in Dallas county so they tend to ignore places outside of the county
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 		yeah yeah i i i find that attitude kind of arrogant though it's like you're taking our money but you're not bothering to cover things that are interesting to us
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
