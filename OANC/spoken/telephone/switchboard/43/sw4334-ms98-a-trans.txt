 
     		
 	
 		type of music is hot down in Texas
 	
 	
 		uh well i don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas i know what's hot down here with me so that's about all i can feel
 		apt to discuss with you since i just know i don't ever listen to the radio and that's usually what's hot around here so
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so what kind of music do you like
 	
 	
 		uh mostly folk music
 	
 	
 		folk music
 	
 	
 		yeah i find myself uh listening to a lot of uh uh either old timer or New England uh dance bands as well as uh just more popular folk music and new artists coming up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well we're on totally different wavelengths
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm more uh old rock and roll uh some new newer i guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know uh
 		Van Halen that kind of thing  any
 	
 	
 		yeah what about uh classic rock type stations
 	
 	
 		uh i don't listen to the radio at all we live in a fairly small town so uh classic rock for me is what i have which is like uh Doors Eagles Jimmy Hendrix
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		so some some of the older Eagles stuff was good
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i didn't like uh they started getting a little more
 		you know the type of music at at least to me it's uh sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes and i don't like listening at high volumes
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh some of their older stuff stuff was uh you know quite enjoyable to me
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's
 	
 	
 		you know Hotel Hotel California and that era
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that does that's something you don't doesn't even sound good loud really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so yeah definitely so anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some i might know of i don't know any folk music at all
 	
 	
 		well down in Texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah we hear
 	
 	
 		i'm sure i'm sure there's a lot of that down there
 	
 	
 		oh plenty way way more than i can stand down here
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i i don't care for it at all that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it i
 	
 	
 		well there there's a Conway Twitty twang then there's the uh Dolly Parton uh Hollywood sound type
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's more even more commercialized form of country music but uh it's getting uh uh getting pretty big everywhere as i see it Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses so it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think some of them the artists are even uh hitting the pop charts
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is concert tours for country and western singers is
 		it's it's quite quite odd but
 		uh i don't know it's music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays i think it's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music you know it's it's it's
 	
 	
 		hey i i i think most artists are in to make a few bucks
 	
 	
 		yeah and that's all it's it's
 	
 	
 		but they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do late late sixties early seventies they were they were definitely pushing a message
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		yeah that's what it it was
 		yeah that's what what you say and and then music is wrapped around now now it's the other way around
 	
 	
 		yeah and i don't i don't think gun at least to my mind Guns and Roses doesn't have too much of a message too much to say
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no no they don't have anything really important you want to hear but you know it's kind of odd it's like
 		doesn't have to be good it's just who does it you know you hear a you hear a Paula Abdul song and you and i think if somebody else were to play that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know they wouldn't they nobody everybody would think that's lousy but because she did it it's supposed to be good you know it comes to the point where it's your name not what you do
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		more than anything Madonna can do anything and it would be considered good because it's Madonna you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		Madonna could start playing folk music and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it so it's it's it's really backwards how things are working now but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah it it it's the artist not the merit
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly so i don't know i i don't know that that's i don't think that's a good thing at all but that's  that's what the point we've reached so i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least
 	
 	
 		well i don't know i know for myself that uh for the most part i don't know which artist is which so i listen to a song i either like the song or i don't like it and then if i really like the song eventually i'll figure out who it was
 	
 	
 		yeah you
 		yeah yeah that's about how i am on popular music i don't you know you don't i don't know enough about it because i just listen uh everything i listen to is what i buy not whatever they play on the radio so
 	
 	
 		well you have to figure out what to buy or do you just buy along the same artist and
 	
 	
 		uh i yeah i just mostly buy along the same lines all the time i don't really switch around to new things very often
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just it's you know it's way to hectic and too confusing it's
 	
 	
 		yeah so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop
 	
 	
 		uh yeah generally or about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know will buy something new that i haven't heard and i listen to it that way but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as far as yeah i don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless i've heard it
 	
 	
 		yeah see that's one thing i like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know there's a couple of nice uh small coffee houses up in New Jersey
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's very nice you go into the coffee house and you know an artist is there and very often the artist will have a demo an album
 		and so if you like the artist you buy the album
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you definitely get to try before you buy
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's definitely i that's
 	
 	
 		though it you you you don't always quite get it right
