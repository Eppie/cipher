 
     		
 	
 		right uh actually i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		lived over in Europe for a couple of years i lived in Germany and in Germany they don't have the jury system what they do is they have uh three judges basically
 		and you get up there and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence and your defense attorney presents their evidence and those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not
 	
 	
 		our our our judicial system is in such total chaos
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think what they need to do is they need to somehow
 		take
 		the money out of it i mean when you have a man that's signed a
 		a a statement saying he's guilty we have a a family called all day family they were all murderers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		all the people signed confessions they went to a trial by jury they been trying these people now for twenty two years ever since i was a child
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done has nothing to do with justice whatsoever
 	
 	
 		well you know it's it's one of those things i mean uh uh i would have to look at that if they did it with the uh
 		just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight
 		because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures they know what's good and what isn't they'd be able to say i'm sorry you can't
 		use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and you know you wouldn't have this uh
 		uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury and then the judge says oh no disregard disregard that come on any jury's not going to disregard the evidence you know
 	
 	
 		uh that's true i i i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself
 	
 	
 		that may very well be
 	
 	
 		i i hold it in the utmost contempt the uh
 	
 	
 		uh that's a
 	
 	
 		the the my favorite is
 		the police department  they're not aimed at the criminal the judicial system is aimed at the citizens because you and i
 		we have work schedules we can be called at work we have Social Security numbers they can trace us down we have telephones and we have checkbooks criminals have none of these things they're real difficult to catch and if they do catch them
 		they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas us we write a check
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so where do you think they target their efforts
 	
 	
 		that's true you do have a
 	
 	
 		they target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals
 	
 	
 		well how would you go about changing it
 	
 	
 		you know that's a i've nailed the problem down but i
 	
 	
 		leave the details up to somebody else huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about i think to begin with
 		you would have you would have like here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical yet you go out on the streets and they're giving speeding tickets
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from
 	
 	
 		well you know uh talking about the lawyers
 		you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to
 		set the fees for cases it's kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh VCR or television repair if you take your TV in
 		a lot of these TV repair places will say well i'll repair your TV for a hundred dollars
 		and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it
 		then he eats it he he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars now if he comes in and says you know i'll repair your your VCR or somebody else's VCR for a hundred dollars
 		gets in there maybe it's a blown fuse takes him two minutes he fixes it he still charges you that hundred dollars
 		so maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know whether it's a murder case or a you know a civil uh somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case and that's it none of this
 	
 	
 		now i i firmly believe in that because when you get the most
 		heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney and here's this bum that didn't have a job and he's got a attorney that you and i could never afford
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 		that's true yeah
 	
 	
 		who's paying for that
 	
 	
 		um yeah well you you know  you're talking to part of them that's paying for that
 	
 	
 		yeah and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it
 	
 	
 		that's right you know that's it it's it's amazing and and when you stop and look at it i mean the judges they're they're all former lawyers
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's another problem i think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean they're
 		they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever and with that type person running it i mean you you could expect that you you could expect that you
