 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well here in Logan Utah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		we got a nice little valley here and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter
 		when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley
 	
 	
 		hm
 		well here in Seattle uh it's giving the air's getting more and more polluted to where uh we're in kind of a basin
 		and uh
 		
 
 		Seattle's on Puget Sound which is a
 		inland waterway between two mountains
 		and uh there's been a lot of lot of growth population growth around here
 		and uh it's uh it's getting worse  i think most of it is from cars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah definitely here in Utah
 		up along the Wasatch front along the
 		western side of the of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north
 		we get a lot of pollution and it's like seventy percent of it's from cars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the  inversion and when we get
 		get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above and it just sits and sits and sits and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of LA a few years ago
 	
 	
 		uh-oh
 	
 	
 		it's not it's almost sad because when i grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now it's not in the mountain valleys
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i live in the university district and uh
 		uh it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think probably due to uh a lot of students going back and forth to school
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm we're right next to Interstate 5 also
 	
 	
 		they're getting serious about things like uh mandatory well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties emissions
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah they started doing that yet
 	
 	
 		yeah they've actually started doing it down along the not in Logan up here because we're doing a lot better we have a lot population's a lot lighter up here
 	
 	
 		we have that here and uh they're they're expanding it to uh more counties here um as the population spreads out
 		and i think they're also gonna be making it uh
 		mandatory for more cars there there was uh
 		something in the law about if you're car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didn't have to get it done anymore and i think they're eliminating that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep they're getting eliminating that out here
 	
 	
 		that loophole yeah
 	
 	
 		they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun
 		where they're uh looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the
 		basically how much of what is coming out the exhaust kind of like a radar gun
 		and yes
 	
 	
 		oh really they make you do that remotely
 	
 	
 		yeah do it remotely just looking at the what they do they do several different types of things sometimes they put a source light
 		and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually
 	
 	
 		hm  now where does the source light go
 	
 	
 		and
 		like across the street they'll set up like a trap or something that add in some sense and they're also looking at uh
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		other
 		you know ways of monitoring this and because they found out something basically that uh
 		and a poorly tuned car can emit something it's an incredible amount it was like four hundred times as much
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		um
 		of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons
 		then a a properly tuned car and and the idea being that if you just tuned up
 		all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the
 		the pollution then
 		you know you'd it be one way to cut the pollution in half
 	
 	
 		yeah that's neat
 		
 
 		but it's also been uh
 		oh you know everybody is talking about using more mass transient here but
 		it uh
 		it's tough you know like i've i've looked into riding the bus to work and
 		i can drive to work in uh
 		and get there in twenty to twenty five minutes over a very congested corridor which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but if i uh
 		
 
 		if i take the bus it requires several transfers
 		and it takes over an hour
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah and they're
 	
 	
 		so it it's it's not hard to see why i why i keep driving and you know i feel guilty because i'm driving a
