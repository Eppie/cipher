 		recycling has become somewhat in vogue we've always had recycling centers around where you can take in newspapers and bottles and things and put them in the right bin
 		but it's totally voluntary and basically only the ecologically minded would go to such pains places because it's it's a drive out of your way to take things to these
 		but recently we started a program i think is getting encourages a lot more participation which is uh you have to now pay for each trash bag that that the garbage man picks up you have to pay a dollar and a half
 		and we uh you have to buy a sticker uh and it costs a dollar and a half and you have to put the sticker on your trash bag and if you don't have that sticker on there then the garbage man won't pick it up
 		now that's that that's for regular trash if you have recyclable trash
 	
 	
 		i would
 	
 	
 		like newspapers or right now it's limited to i think the newspapers and plastic bottles plastic milk bottles then they'll pick that up for free
 		so there's the motivation basically your regular garbage you have to pay to get picked up and recyclable stuff if you put it in a recyclable bin
 		or recyclable uh container they they give you one of these then that that doesn't cost anything so that encourages people to participate
 	
 	
 		well that's makes sense ours seems really crazy because well we've had the places all the shopping centers i mean the local shopping centers where there's a grocery store and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a you know drug store and so on have bins around where you can leave papers or aluminum cans
 		that type of thing for uh oh the Kiwanis or some sort of groups pick them up and make money for their causes and those are fairly popular and work fairly well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you can also take your own stuff to a recycling center and you know get the few pennies you get for the papers or cans
 		i know some people who do that but to me that too much trouble for the few cents
 		the uh so i just drop it off at the local place when i go to the store and let them
 		you know some good agency make some money off of it what little they get and uh that works for me but now as i understand it from reading the paper the system seems totally backwards
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh they are starting a thing where all of our garbage bills are going up like a dollar and a half a month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's because they will give us containers you know certain colors of bins and stuff to put cans and papers and so on in that all makes sense
 		but if you don't want to recycle you can say i don't want to recycle and save a dollar and a half a month
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		which the theory is that if you don't want to recycle with the city who actually has a private contractor do it
 		uh if you don't recycle with the city then you're going to take it yourself and you know make your money off of your paper and cans
 		somehow it seems to me like people will just say i don't want to pay the buck and a half and i'll throw it in the garbage
 		so
 	
 	
 		so like somebody messed up
 	
 	
 		it sounds to me like it's messed up but they've had
 	
 	
 		a strategic miscalculation on their part
 	
 	
 		i guess so we'll have to see what happens they're just supposed to start distributing these blue plastic containers for cans and bottles and different kind different colors for different things
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so it's totally voluntary even if you pay your dollar and a half you don't you you can still put everything in the trash
 	
 	
 		you still could so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me and i think i understand it pretty well from both the paper and TV and we'll see what happens
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		any idea how many people are going to do it are going to do it
 	
 	
 		oh supposedly the majority are
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it's pretty ecologically conscious here
 	
 	
 		so some of the people will go along with it anyway
 	
 	
 		oh i think so plus a lot of people will probably just pay the buck and a half and not even notice the difference or care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		it seems strange now at the the university where i work it's uh strange too because they have places you can leave cans and some campus organization recycles them
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		and uh there is a campus recycling bins not bins but like i work in a library
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and there are barrels where we can recycle newspapers and different types of things but they're in staff areas
 		but we have wanted to have specially marked trash cans next to all the copy machines
