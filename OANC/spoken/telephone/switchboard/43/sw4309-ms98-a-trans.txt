 
     		
 	
 		why what would you tell someone
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		well i think first thing is they need to talk with their child to  their child talk to their child and find exactly what they want
 		to do why are they're going why are they going to college instead of doing something else
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		once you find out why they want to go to college then you can get a better idea of
 		uh what range of colleges they should go to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh obviously if they want to learn trade skills you wouldn't send them to an academic center and vice versa
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um beyond that i think you need to consider the uh range of expenses of going to college that would probably narrow your ranges down even further
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if you want to go something beyond what you can afford then you need to start investigating scholarship and other things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i think you start out with something broad like that and then narrow your range as you you know as you find out more about the child and what the their uh needs are and what they want to do
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well i guess i would agree somewhat i mean in terms of finding out first why they want to go to college if they do want to go to college a lot of times it's the parents who want them to go to college rather than themselves
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that does happen yes
 	
 	
 		um but uh i think it's probably the the studies have been done looking at uh
 		how well you are and what you do when you end up whether or not you uh have a degree or not uh makes a big difference later on in your life
 		and um  you know it'd be good to even to start as early as possible to understand what what you child would desire
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and determine a goal some point uh before like the last moment
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		and but you know you never know they always a lot of people go to college because they don't know what else is better to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it seems like it's my experience
 		but uh i guess that once they've decided they wanted to go to college
 		i think that's that's also that's something  uh important but uh
 		you know have them go through the i guess they have like the Barron's books and various other books that describes
 		all the different colleges that they are in terms of competitiveness and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they could also narrow it down that way other than just the economic things
 		though it's probably more so now than used to be
 		um but people you know you want to try to match their needs as best they can and then if
 		you know you could always shoot for those places that don't have you know are  that might be considered out of your range but sometimes you might be able to get a scholarship or whatever have you so i wouldn't rule them out on the first cut
 		uh i would try to get them to to find the colleges they think that are
 		you know best fit their needs in terms of the size the college the kinds of course offerings the reputation they have in those areas
 		um you know whether a child wants to be closer or away how far away they want to be from home there's a lot of different other aspects to it you know
 	
 	
 		that does enter into it all
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh i think there's things like student uh faculty ratios and and uh
 		all that kind of stuff how well endowed the school is sometimes you that's important because if it's not well endowed school
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh then a you know a lot of times they're just they uh the schools go from year to year based on just the enrollment
 		and uh if that's what the school's doing then um it may not be around the following year especially these times
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know they're not as economically sound  right
 	
 	
 		well i have a a daughter now who is
 		a junior  who is looking at colleges and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's interesting uh there were a lot more choices years ago when i went to college
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		she is is going through the process much like what you're you know you've described and i've described described so
 		how far away do they want to go what do they want to do how important is whether it's a private or a public school
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what are the chances for scholarships
 		and uh a lot of mid range smaller schools that
 		are actually easier to get into if you have pretty good grades of course it's not quite so comparative to say the Ivy League schools
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		yeah they also tend not to be as well endowed and they also have
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		lots of other uh good and bad points sometimes the offerings that they have is better than
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know some of the Ivy schools that's for sure uh
 		but there's also other problems too
 		um you know they tend to they all admit all sorts of people
