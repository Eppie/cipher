 
     		
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		let's see how about um
 		let's see about ten years ago
 		um
 		what do you think was different ten years ago from now
 	
 	
 		well i would say as far as social changes go um
 		i think families were more together they they did more things together uh they ate dinner at the table together um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the the parents usually took out time um you know more time than they do now to come with the children and and just spend the day doing a family activity
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um although i'm not a mother i i still think that um a lot has changed since ten years ago
 		um what do you think about that
 	
 	
 		what do you well uh
 		actually ten years from today seems rather short
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		but i do agree that uh generally it's
 		society has sort of
 		uh
 		let's see rushed everything ahead
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i don't know it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently
 		but i think that has a lot to do with economic situations
 	
 	
 		yes what about like as far as um social changes in the individual
 		do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let's say ten twenty years ago
 	
 	
 		uh
 		hm it depends uh
 		it's hard to say because i think
 		people were busy ten twenty years ago too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		i just
 	
 	
 		well how how old are you
 	
 	
 		i'm twenty eight
 	
 	
 		twenty eight okay i'm twenty three
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so there's maybe a five year gap between us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along it's just a matter where priorities are at placed
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and that um usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work
 	
 	
 		do you think it's an economic crisis necessity or do you think that we're we're uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living
 	
 	
 		i think that's part of it too but i do think
 	
 	
 		i mean do you think people really need two cars and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no no i don't
 	
 	
 		a house in the suburbs or
 	
 	
 		no i don't think that but then there are a lot of people that that don't have that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that
 		that really do need to work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents
 		just to  survive and then there that is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		they think is is surviving  which is really more luxuries um but i i tend to think that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive
 	
 	
 		you so you think it's
 		uh which group are you saying is the one trying
 	
 	
 		i'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living
 		because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who
 		the uh decreasing um
 		middle class in this country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think that that's in my opinion the case
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so
 		i mean i have met people that
 		uh both that
 		that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job
 	
 	
 		okay and then sometimes i i often uh find that
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		maybe there's so many different things available to us  a microwave a VCR a answering machine um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know a special a dishwasher um a refrigerator and some of those items um
 		for the for the um well i guess we're sticking more to social changes but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		people want all of that and not all of those are necessities
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so they're trying to
 		it has become a necessity
