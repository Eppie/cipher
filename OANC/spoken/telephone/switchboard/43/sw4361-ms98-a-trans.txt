 
     		
 	
 		so what do you think
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well that's a pretty loaded topic  well here in um
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		hang on just a second the dog is barking
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay here in Oklahoma we just went through a uh major educational reform we're uh that was a hot topic
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh part of the problem had been there wasn't enough spent on education the classes were too large
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we recently well we're we're through a proposition now where they're limiting class size to about twenty two i think and they've increased salaries and just done a major revision
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah are your um
 		schools paid for primarily with your real estate tax
 	
 	
 		yes yeah it's just about all
 	
 	
 		yeah what for a typical middle class house uh what kind of annual tax do you pay
 	
 	
 		oh well actually the actually it isn't just  i i said yes and it really isn't we
 	
 	
 		well i know it's split federal and so forth
 	
 	
 		we also well no we have a uh an excise tax on cars our car tags are very expensive average taxes are very low on real estate probably in the five to six hundred dollar a year range
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		they are
 		oh okay okay because um over here
 		um you could pay between four and eight thousand dollars a year
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i'd be surprised if we're getting something that was ten times as good as what you're getting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		matter of fact i'll bet it's not as good
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um my feeling is that
 		there you know while there are certain problems where
 		you know being able to buy a new set of books or a new piece of equipment may be valuable by and large that correlation between the amount of money you shovel in and the quality of education doesn't seem to be that strong
 	
 	
 		yeah i i do have to tend to agree with you the only other problem with that is that it's difficult to attract people into the teaching profession
 	
 	
 		well again i don't know what it's like on your side of the fence um over here
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um teachers' salaries aren't bad uh they're not executive type salaries although if you're a
 		teacher whose been at it for fifteen twenty years uh you can retire  when you when you reach the top level it's not bad at all it's quite good
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think that's that's the other thing here the benefits are  very good for teachers where
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 		thing is there are nonfinancial there there should be nonfinancial benefits to teaching that i think we've managed to squash out of the system
 		um it used to be thirty years ago being a teacher was a uh position of respect you were educating the young
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um now it seems that you know now the the joke of the year is you know those who can't teach
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um you know so something went wrong somewhere along the line and i think it's felt both by the people in the educational profession and those outside
 		there's a wonderful book by a fellow named Charles Murray
 		called In Pursuit of Happiness
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he discusses what he feels is wrong with the educational system
 		and um
 		he even offers some suggestions for improvements uh one of the points he makes is he feels that any attempt to fix the problems
 		uh whatever the nature of the reform is the administration of the reform will be captured by the union and rendered ineffective
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in other words if you decide that you're gonna pump another ten percent money in it'll right eventually filter down it filters it's way around to the most firmly entrenched teachers with no regard to their skill level um if you provide other benefits
 		they'll eventually work their way around to more firmly entrench the problems not to resolve them
 		i'm not sure i agree with him completely but he makes some interesting points
 	
 	
 		yeah that does i i think though you hit the the nail on the head  when you when you said it's the attitude more than anything of the teacher profession the teaching profession um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that that's something you really can't change even with money
 	
 	
 		well it did change the thing to do is find out uh why um because uh
 		you know there was a time when the teacher was a respected individual and something changed um and intrinsically intrinsically the ideas you know um training our
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the youth of the country to be uh mature productive responsible citizens is potentially a uh
 		a very um what's the right word
 		um it's potentially a very rewarding not rewarding but uh it should be a respected profession so the question about asking is not why does no  why isn't it but well it should be what's preventing it from being respected
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		right it's a it's a pretty big responsibility i mean to to teach
 	
 	
 		now
 		absolutely absolutely i have a wife who substitute teaches and um she brings home some interesting stories uh but the thing that you know i i hate falling into the trap of back when i was a kid
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i'm just saying that but the thing that changed is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		back when i was a kid you know maybe hated the teacher maybe you didn't do your work but you respected or at least feared the teacher
