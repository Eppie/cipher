 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well Julie um are you in a situation where you'd
 		soon need to deal with uh
 		special care for elderly
 	
 	
 		well i don't know my grandfather
 		is ninety two years old
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he is still living by himself my mother grandmother died a couple of years ago
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but he doesn't want to to move away he lives in a lil farmhouse on a farm
 		and he recently had to have an operation but he just really doesn't wanna go to a nursing home
 	
 	
 		is he able to uh still do do everything himself pretty well
 	
 	
 		well he was until this operation he has arthritis
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		now i don't really think he's doing that well and my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him
 		and i have one aunt that really looks after him a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was
 		a hundred and three
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um died six weeks after they put him in the home
 	
 	
 		yeah and i'm sure that kind of thing would influence your father's grandfather's feelings because
 		um i think you know i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of
 		do they still have some of their life left
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and far as far as i'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home is like saying my life is over and i'm just here for the rest of the stay
 		and so i you know  i guess most of the time when i think about somebody going into a nursing home
 		it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs ah they can look after a lot of things but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		i know my
 		none of my grandparents were in a nursing home they generally
 		were able to have someone care for them at home and they died but they were all
 		goodness younger than your grandparents like they were in their eighties that type of thing um
 		but i did uh
 		you know i guess uh when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to do some take care of themselves physically
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but i just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job
 	
 	
 		and that's that's difficult part because i think what they ofend get
 		used as is uh
 		almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a hospital
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		i know like here in Saskatchewan we have our
 		hospital care well and the care actually for the elderly older people graded in level in four levels
 		and a level four type of care would be someone that
 		really requires long-term hospital care ah generally are not able to look after thisselves to very to a very great extent physically
 		often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's disease or those  or or physical and mental handicaps
 		um you know where they really required
 		twenty four hour supervision of some kind even though it may be minimal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		but i think  it can be helpful
 		in that uh it gets people the level of physical care they need
 		um
 	
 	
 		but i don't i mean at least i mean i think some nursing homes do that but i think a lot of nursing homes really
 		um are guilty of neglect
 	
 	
 		yeah i think and i think it happens more in areas where it's uh
 		i guess uh
 		a broad social medical system where uh
 		you know there's government medical care and that kind of thing if it it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals
 		and and i guess that's sort of my lack of understanding i think that a majority of the places in the US um you know there is some government aid available but the majority of it is
 		to the ability of the individual to pay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely on
