 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the only experience i have i don't have any children but i've um
 		i was a babysitter in high school and then just recently after we were married i babysat for a dentist while she worked and i just
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the only thing i've ever done also is babysit but um i've heard people that i work with talk about you know child care especially i guess it's even harder on single mothers
 	
 	
 		is it
 		oh yeah the expense
 	
 	
 		yeah having to pick up the kid by you know six o'clock or it's five dollars for every minute you're late and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is understandable i mean these people can't you know
 		stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late but
 	
 	
 		just sit around
 		that's true see the lady i did it for that's why she picked picked me is because i would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up so she could sleep in
 		and um then she could be at home and then i'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if i wanted too or whatever but um
 		she paid i think it was two or three it was about two fifty three dollars a hour and by the time i paid taxes on it it i was getting like eighty cents and that wasn't counting food or
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		gas or anything
 	
 	
 		yeah it's hardly worth your time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty bad the only time i babysat was in high school and it you know of course you don't have i didn't pay taxes on that so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it was easy you know go over to some um it was these people that lived in our neighborhood and
 		i'd just go over there every Thursday night they went to the theater they had permanent tickets and they'd give me it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids but they would usually give me more like five dollars more at the end of the night
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and i mean they'd you know it was great i'd go over there and there would be like
 		uh you know there's we have these videos over here watch whatever you want and there's some Oreos in the in the cupboard and there's some Coke and you know just help yourself to anything so it was it was you know the best that was a long time ago and that was only for a few years just once a week
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		i think people that treat their baby sitters like that get a lot better baby sitters
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and they stick around for longer because i mean after i figured out i was getting eighty cents an hour i said bag it and i quit you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i was just like but i'm wasting my time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i really liked the little girl and everything but i thought
 	
 	
 		she does take up and they do take up a lot of your time that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i
 	
 	
 		they're very demanding
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  well and she was really spoiled they didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything so basically they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and the mom was a dentist and i was just like we've got to quit this  and she's like no i don't want her to starve but i don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat
 	
 	
 		oh shoot my mom would be like
 	
 	
 		like
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		eat this or
 	
 	
 		eat it or don't eat anything that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so i can see the concerns on what different people want because some i mean you know if i was setting up a day care there would be so many needs you would have to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		customize your service to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because some parents won't put up with anything where others would
 	
 	
 		i think yeah i think the best way to go would just be to to be able to do it out of your basement
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and just have like ten at the most like ten kids and all from maybe people that you know type of thing instead of trying actually to set up a day care where you don't know the people coming in and
 	
 	
 		no
 		that's true i i'd love to do it but i just don't trust people now there's too many lawsuits
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just i think it's a bigger risk than
 	
 	
 		more than what it's worth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it would scare me with i don't know because i'm sure some of them have good reason to sue but i think a lot of them are just
 		you know they're negligent and they get happy about money and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they just want to sue you
 	
 	
 		well yeah that's yeah exactly when you have like a Kindercare or something set up and they when they get greedy or whatever that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's just you know you can't watch kids that many little kids getting into things at one time
 	
 	
 		that's impossible
 	
 	
 		you know you never know what they're going to get into
 	
 	
 		i have a girlfriend that works at a day care and she takes her little girl with her and
 		i mean she told me about half the people that they hire and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state
 		and that's the people that are working there you know and then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in you know
 	
 	
 		oh that's horrible
 	
 	
 		like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before the same diaper
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know just awful things and
 		so i don't know i don't have kids but i always think man i just don't know if i could trust anybody
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah that's the the yeah that's a hard thing about it if i mean
 	
 	
 		i mean you just don't know
 	
 	
 		i don't i can't foresee myself getting married but if you know if i ever wanted to have a kid how could i work i mean i don't think i could trust somebody with my kid either unless it was a friend that you know did it in their house that i knew well
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		that's true
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just i couldn't do it i don't think
 	
 	
 		it would just rip me apart i think  i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah just besides the fact that you know your when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait
 	
 	
 		not knowing
