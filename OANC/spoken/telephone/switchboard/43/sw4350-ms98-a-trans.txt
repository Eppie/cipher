 
     		
 	
 		well i think that there's uh a few things i would like to see um in the work environment that could improve things and number one is um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		health benefits things like uh insurance for number one but another would be like um  facilities or the ease some easy way to go out and exercise or something like that if you felt like it in the middle the day
 	
 	
 		i i definitely agree on that um i'm working for a law firm right now the benefits are not bad the only thing i think that they're desperately missing is we have no dental plan whatsoever
 	
 	
 		um yeah same here
 	
 	
 		um
 		but as far as what i'd really like to see is i live close enough to the city that i would be able to bicycle in if i could
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		if there was some sort of provided provided facility for that um maybe a locker area a shower area to change to take a shower before work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and some place to lock the bicycles up
 		and i've heard of a lot of other companies providing that
 		that would be something to look forward to
 		um
 		
 
 		let's see
 	
 	
 		another one i'd like to see would be in flexible scheduling of hours
 	
 	
 		well a lot depends on the job though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what do you do
 	
 	
 		well right now i'm still in school i'm still a student but the ability to
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		you know kind of have a little bit of freedom over that to schedule your work from day to day from week to week so every once in a while you can slip in a three day weekend without having to use a day vacation or or just something like that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		feel like taking a class at night and you just come in earlier for a while or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be nice
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		i suppose that does depend on the type of job type of environment you're in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um  i'm right now also a full time student
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh but i work in the evenings for the law firm
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it's a rather yeah it's a rather interesting uh
 		rather interesting interesting set up  work full time go to school full time
 	
 	
 		yeah that can be rough
 		yeah i did that for about a year and had my fill of that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		swore to never do it again
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		i think another thing um would be nice i guess this is more of an overall really nebulous kind of thing would be consideration of
 		um  like the family in some in somebody's in the way that somebody relates to the work place
 	
 	
 		how so
 	
 	
 		um well an example would be in the military they give a whole lot of allowances for family people they even get paid more
 		they get um allowances for
 		um you know have being married or having children i don't really think that that is fair i think uh equal work equal pay for equal work ought to be applied in that case
 	
 	
 		well they do
 	
 	
 		but um they get housing and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i have friends that are in the military and they do get quite a lot of perks
 	
 	
 		and other considerations as well you know their the duty is a little bit different and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but that you know recently there was some kind of documentary on some station i don't know what and some guy was on there he was a middle level manager and he was talking about how
 		you know here he'd spent all these years putting in fifty hour weeks um you know for these various places he'd worked at now you know here he was totally unemployed and been unemployed for nine months and it got him absolutely nothing
 		some kind of consideration there would be nice as well
 		i don't know what would be the solution i suppose uh
 		not foolishly giving an extra ten hours a week to some place
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if they're just gonna pork you in the end
 	
 	
 		um what a lot what a lot of companies do is far as far as their health benefits are concerned the insurance provides um coverage for the spouse and or family
 		in a lot of cases i know that's the case in my office at least
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they'll provide minimum benefits for your spouse and dependent codependent children not like the case applies to me but um
 		it is nice that they offer it
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a good consideration for families
 		that's absolute necessity in today's world and price
 	
 	
 		definitely and health insurance costs
 	
 	
 		man they're getting so expensive
 		right now i don't have any health insurance it's kind of disturbing unless you
 	
 	
 		you you're not still covered under your parents
 	
 	
 		no i'm gonna be thirty this year but
 	
 	
 		oh wow  when you said you were going to school full time
 	
 	
 		and yeah i'm working on my PhD
 	
 	
 		oh that's different
 	
 	
 		it's a long road  but the insurance they have at school is kind of uh they've got a really minimum plan and it'll cover you you know and as a student you don't need a whole lot if
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you lose a leg or something like that you just need the skin folded over you know you know just something to keep you alive till you graduate and make some money and i suppose can go out and get it fixed then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		right
 		what school is this
 	
 	
 		Georgia Tech in Atlanta
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		but man it is just uh really expensive two years ago it was two hundred dollars for the basic uh major medical and the next year it was four hundred you know it doubled in a year like that
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and so this this is that year that was four hundred i just wasn't prepared to pay for it i'm not too sure what i'm gonna do about that right now there's still another six months to go and it's not a pleasant feeling worrying about that
 	
 	
 		right now
 		right now the company that my company that picks up the insurance they pay i think it's thirty dollars a month
 		so that'll be at three sixty a year
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and that's basic uh group health coverage
 	
 	
 		is there any deductible with that or anything like
 	
 	
 		no
