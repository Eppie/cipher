 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		so eating out
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what are you interested in in restaurants
 	
 	
 		right um
 		we eat out quite a bit it's just my husband and i at home now so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh once a week twice a week
 	
 	
 		oh at least once a week
 		we're we're retired now when we working out we ate out more than that
 	
 	
 		yeah i understand
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh but we both work and we have a daughter and
 		we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well what type of restaurant do you like Richard
 	
 	
 		uh
 		really i'm kind of open on food i'm
 		what you might call a culinary adventurer i'll
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'll try anything once
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		been on a real barbecue kick lately
 	
 	
 		oh have you we like Chinese we eat a lot of Chinese food
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		excuse me uh
 		yeah
 		we usually have Chinese once a month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		what do you look for in a restaurant
 	
 	
 		uh i hate franchised restaurants
 	
 	
 		you what you
 	
 	
 		i despise franchised restaurants i i
 	
 	
 		oh i
 	
 	
 		always prefer to go to
 		something that seems more family run uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		some place where you
 		seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost
 	
 	
 		i know what you mean i like some ambience and
 		i like good food i don't like fast food hamburgers and all of that
 	
 	
 		i don't
 		but i don't like something fake or put on either uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know if i could have the the good small restaurant or a good large restaurant i'd go to the good small restaurant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		i don't know why that is
 		i think it's probably due to
 		pricing often
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh i don't care to go to a place just
 		for the price of it huh
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean it's uh continental French restaurant or something really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		with high prices and seven courses isn't what i usually look for
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it is what you usually look oh isn't isn't
 	
 	
 		it isn't no that isn't what i look for
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i try to
 		get my money's worth
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		not just that i try to
 		well that's a big part of it i try to get my money's worth
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 		and not just in quantity you know but but quality and and
 		flavor and and texture and care
 	
 	
 		presentation and
 	
 	
 		well presentation's not always all of it either it's it's important
 	
 	
 		well like
 		we we've been eating some in a restaurant that that just changed hands recently and we're trying to give them a little patronage but
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		Sunday we went there and i had a
 		pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple
 		and potatoes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah something a little extra
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's what i mean by right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and just for color if nothing else
 	
 	
 		it would mean a lot to the looks of the plate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		what i miss up here is
 		i'm originally a Texan
 		and i'm
 		miss
 		home cooked Mexican yeah yeah home cooked Tex-Mex uh Mexican restaurants where
 	
 	
 		Tex-Mex Tex-Mex
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation
 	
 	
 		right i know
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico and we've really gotten to like we like the real Mexican food better than the Tex-Mex
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well there's real Mexican food and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican you know by
 		third or fourth generation Americans
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		of the Hispanic heritage
 	
 	
 		it's all pretty good isn't it
 	
 	
 		oh yes  and and there's big differences of course and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of course when you talk about Mexican cuisine you that's kind of like talking about American food or or a Chinese food because
 		its regional too
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh that's true
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i'm originally from Maine so we like seafood too and that's something we don't get here and we're in the mountains in Virginia
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ah
 	
 	
 		and most of the seafood's frozen
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ah yeah that's  the way it is here in Colorado also
 		no fresh  or almost no fresh seafood
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and
 		
 
 		in Texas we got it from the Gulf
 	
 	
 		uh-huh true lots of shrimp
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah here a couple years ago my wife and i went to Seattle on vacation
 		and i think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week and it was
 	
 	
 		i know it
 	
 	
 		i was like a man starving at every meal
 	
 	
 		i know the feeling
 		we do the same thing my son-in-law is a Texan and when he goes to Maine he eats lobster i guess at least twice a day all the time he's up there
 	
 	
 		ha
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's a lot cheaper there isn't it lobster
 	
 	
 		oh yes yeah it's like
 	
 	
 		it's like shrimp on the Gulf
 	
 	
 		two ninety eight a pound for a pound lobster
 	
 	
 		two ninety eight a pound
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's as cheap as steaks some places
 	
 	
 		oh yeah or cheaper right yeah a lot of the restaurants you can get
 	
 	
 		i mean in a grocery store yeah
 	
 	
 		two pound two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety nine
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh  i've got to go to Maine then i you may have sold a trip for some time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah it's a good place to go
 	
 	
 		uh it sounds wonderful uh so
 	
 	
 		lots of little restaurants too with home cooked food that up there
 	
 	
 		that sound good i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		down in the Gulf i've eaten a bunch of those little
 		oh seafood shacks we've called them
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh it's just it so much different than to eat something that's been frozen
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		we went to Galveston
 	
 	
 		shrimp straight out of the bay bay
 	
 	
 		we were in Galveston last year after right after well the first of this year actually
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and uh ate in a restaurant and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf Coast
 	
 	
 		was it true
 	
 	
 		no it wasn't on the way across Louisiana we pulled off we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place
 		and they had it was a small restaurant just kind of out of the way
 		and they were set up with two buffets one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything and then one complete seafood buffet
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that was the best shrimp i have ever had in my life they had shrimp fixed probably six different ways
 	
 	
 		ah yes the cajuns
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right it was wonderful
 	
 	
 		they can they can do things to shrimp that that no one else can so have you eaten crawfish yet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh i tried it but i didn't care for it not there but at my brothers i tried it
 	
 	
 		oh as with anything it's preparation
 	
 	
 		that's probably true it
 		i wasn't hungry it wasn't a meal we just he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them just so we'd try them
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it there's all kinds
 	
 	
 		probably needed some cold beer with it and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so you do eat out a lot
 	
 	
 		quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh one of our other
 		real problems with going out to eat Sunday morning brunches
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know Sunday brunch all all you can eat brunches
 	
 	
 		right
 		we used to do that once in a while but we don't anymore
 	
 	
 		uh we still find it fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it's fun but it's just so much food  hate to come away feeling uncomfortable
 	
 	
 		but
 		well am
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor
 	
 	
 		do you well that makes a difference
 	
 	
 		and so
 	
 	
 		where do you go to brunches like hotels or
 		restaurants there
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah uh actually one of our
 		one of our favorites is a chain
 		Shoney's
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in spite of the
 	
 	
 		we eat at Shoney's
 	
 	
 		and in spite of the fact i've spoken so badly about chains chain restaurants uh
 		
 
 		we uh do like Shoney's pretty well but then there's a
 		place up the pass up in the mountains
 		that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings
 		drive drive up to i think it's about
 		eight thousand foot elevation and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and
 		and drive through Woodland Park and
 		go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that sounds nice
 	
 	
 		it it
 		it's the way to spend a a nice Sunday morning
 	
 	
 		right i imagine it is
 	
 	
 		i think it's as much the the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch you know  and it's not that far it's thirty miles
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh uh-huh
 		where out of which direction from out of which direction from there west uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the Colorado Springs what
 		west west out of Colorado
 	
 	
 		yeah
