 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so do you do a lot of cooking in your family
 	
 	
 		um i do some every now and then i i work and my wife's home during the day so she usually ends up doing most of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		when i was single we used to always cook around the house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do do you like to cook
 	
 	
 		huh yeah i really like it um there's a few dishes like i i grew up with the um you know having Polish and Ukrainian food
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and my wife she likes Italian and stuff so we we definitely have different tastes so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah yeah but that's neat though because you get to have different stuff  yeah i'm not i'm a pretty bad cook  i'm pretty bad my husband is really good he put himself through college working in restaurants
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and uh he's a much better cook than i am so when i was home i still cooked a lot and i was into a lot of vegetarian stuff
 		and now that i went back to work about a year and a half ago so one of the things that he took over was the cooking and the kids are thrilled they're really happy that i don't cook anymore
 	
 	
 		they're like uh preferring it now right
 	
 	
 		yeah they say oh dad let dad cook mom  let him do it but um
 		so so do you all do you have kids you obviously have one okay you have two
 	
 	
 		yeah two um-hum
 		yeah one is uh nine months and the other is two and a half
 	
 	
 		two and half oh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the hard part is cooking with uh kids around because uh
 	
 	
 		i was just going to say makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it or are you not at that stage yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it does
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we try our hardest to to get them to eat what we eat you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and my sister uh she's the master of the fast order grill you know she can make uh  she makes six different meals but we like to have one thing you know one likes chicken nuggets the other one like hot dogs
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh my gosh
 		oh my gosh i couldn't yeah
 	
 	
 		and then she makes noodles with uh with soy uh soy sauce or whatever so all things but um yeah our favorite let me think i was thinking of the one recipe that uh
 	
 	
 		boy i couldn't do that i
 	
 	
 		that we made i guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy and that was um
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		uh scallops uh scallop um
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		it has a French name it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese cream sauce with it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah what's what is that Saint Jack or something scallops saint something or yeah  yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and you pour it over rice yeah uh
 		yeah i can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore but uh it it basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then uh standard cream sauce base and then uh
 	
 	
 		really
 		with scallops
 	
 	
 		the scallops and it sounds sort of funny but it tastes really good
 	
 	
 		no no i'm from New England so we we had um a lot of seafood before we moved down here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh that sounds delicious to me that sounds great i think we're just thinking of having a uh dinner party we went to this dinner party the other night that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but uh
 	
 	
 		was kind of like a game they had uh a murder mystery and you came dressed as one of the characters and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it was really fun and so we we were thinking we wanted to do you know we were going to try doing it ourselves but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around
 		trying to get stuff ready for the table and that kind of interrupted the game so
 	
 	
 		right
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		so i was thinking there's this beef bourguignonne recipe that i've tried before that's pretty good and then you can make that ahead and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's another thing i have a problem with my wife
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she uh she likes to um she doesn't like the beef dishes she likes the chicken and fish
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		and like i said we always ate beef and uh pork
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know a lot so
 	
 	
 		i know my husband did too  his parents are Austrian and they uh always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table
 	
 	
 		oh yeah red meat plenty of good red meat
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		my dad could eat a a meal with out any vegetables at all
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and uh Susan's you know they had you know meatless meals you know  my dad wouldn't know what to do
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh gosh so do you
 	
 	
 		course she grew up Catholic so you know they they sort of come with the there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have
 	
 	
 		oh they did the
 		that you do right right that's just part of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah we didn't my family didn't but when i got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly he never there was dishes that he really enjoyed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		eating there there were several things that he liked but it never was really something that he would have chosen it's just that i cooked so he had to put up with it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so but there was one thing that he couldn't stand and that was soybeans i tried it like once or twice and he just could not eat it so i never i had i was limited i had to make vegetarian meals without using soybeans but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it's hard to get a protein content up then
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		huh yeah i like i like them every now and then for a change yes it's nice
 	
 	
 		yeah some of the stuff is good but it just it was a tremendous amount of cooking  because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we had little kids at the time you know when i was home with them and it it was just so much cooking i couldn't i don't like to cook and i'm not really that great at it so it just turned out to be too much of a too much  too much cooking
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so well i guess i'll let you get back to feeding your little one there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no uh he's all done  yeah yeah i set him down
 	
 	
 		he's set oh okay okay
 		do you like to bake at all or do you do you get into that's that's
 	
 	
 		yeah we used to do that um my mom used to go crazy every Sunday until my dad like blew up you know  after after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy she stopped doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um she used to have you know two dozen sticky buns three bread rolls you know every week
 	
 	
 		really no kidding
 	
 	
 		and um the sticky buns of course would last you know three or four days and that would be it
 	
 	
 		yeah then be gone i know that's the thing about baking i used to i i don't mind baking at all and i i can do a pretty good pie we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother and my mother taught me how to make it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um so i can make a pretty mean pie but
 		um i don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening we had the same kind of problem if you make homemade bread i mean forget it's supposed to save you money but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat  it tastes so good
 	
 	
 		hum
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh we always we had that bread that was uh um you ever seen the the starter bread i can't remember what it's called they call it the um Amish bread here but uh it's made with you just leave leave it out
 	
 	
 		oh uh yeah
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		you know and you let it spoil sort of yeah you know
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh i've heard of that i've heard of it but i've never done it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that sounds pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah it tasted pretty good really
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but um it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad and then you add all these other ingredients to it but
 	
 	
 		yeah and then you save you make the bread but you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something
 	
 	
 		yeah right yeah you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else and that's how they continue the thing
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah
 		i know it sounds it always sounded i don't know how safe that was sounded pretty bad
 	
 	
 		yeah i know it sounded strange to me too i figure well you're baking it so you know yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true that's that's got to got to kill anything i guess but
 	
 	
 		um-hum okay well i'll talk to you later where are you calling from by the way Texas
