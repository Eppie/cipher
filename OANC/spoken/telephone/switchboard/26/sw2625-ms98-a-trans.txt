 
     		
 	
 		some of the TV shows that uh i i like are usually something that shows me something about a profession that i don't
 		necessarily know how it operates and one of the earliest shows that uh taught me something was the old Bewitched shows when i was growing up
 		i remember thinking so that's how the advertising game is played that's how they developed these things that's where commercials come from and i really didn't uh before that i think that was the very first show that i ever realized that on and then
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		oh a little bit later i don't particularly like LA Law as a series but i do like some of the insights not so much into the legal profession but into the
 		the fact that some of the well for instance some of the deals that are made by the DA you know you read about some of these things and it sounds really bad well you don't know what's gone on before
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um they had one case where uh the DA had been injured she had been hurt and you know was a little bit fearful of of making friends uh any enemies at the moment
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so uh just little things like that makes well there's a human behind this little story you know that that was was written up in the paper that DA cuts a bad deal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as well as some of the the arguments on you know a guy gets arrested for DWI well depending upon
 		what the guy says he's going to say in court regardless of the truth what the guy says he's going to say is you know is fifteen minutes later before they gave me the test and
 		all these kinds of things and you could probably get away you know get off on it so they just plea bargained it out and is just done with it
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		oh i i those little things i guess i have to be reminded that there're there're so many details that just don't get out that you can't uh can't take the reported word
 		for some of these things so i guess i like shows that that show me something some insights into other parts of of living that i don't always get exposed to how about yourself
 	
 	
 		right i
 		i don't know i've i like tend to like a lot of the old uh
 		older TV shows like uh for instance there there's i love watching old Twilight Zones and uh they've
 		they've been there's a station station here that runs mostly syndicated things and that's one thing i like to catch on late at night is the old Twilight Zones but uh
 		for TV that's out right now i i the shows i like to see for one reason or another that i've been
 		catching um Matlock and Tuesday nights for some some are i guess are my TV night and i like to see uh Matlock and then In the Heat of the Night uh
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		are two shows that that i like to see after seeing the the television show In the Heat of the Night i wanted i haven't never seen the movie but uh i think i'd like to check out that movie sometime it's uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's just kind of interesting they have great characters in that uh TV show and it's interesting from i just saw the pilot to it
 		oh a week or two ago and it was a special two hour thing but it was the first like like i said a pilot and uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		the characters in it were the white police officers when the black the black guy from Philadelphia went down there were much more bigoted and more the villains
 		in that episode and now over the time in the television show they're all very much uh uh
 		not not bigoted or very more more you know more in the twentieth century now let's say or or very  unbigoted and they even have added uh this uh other
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		black police officer to the cast so it's interesting how they kind of got away from the original i guess the premise of the movie as well was the problems that that uh
 		he had with the police officers and now it's more concentrated on the problems they have in the small town in the south and it it's kind of interesting because it's supposed to be this little tiny town in down in
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh down south but uh i live in this little teeny town up here in upstate New York and it's not too much different so people got a lot to learn everywhere
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh that's interesting yeah yeah i i've seen Heat of the Night through off and on through out it's uh
 		television career as it were and i i wonder if uh if they did that intentionally or if they just had uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		whether they decided to do away with the the racial problem as the main thrust of it or whether they were going to show that eventually that would die down somewhat that um
 	
 	
 		right i i don't know either i don't
 	
 	
 		quite possible that they wanted it to become more of the subtle problems that it is today as opposed to the the hitting over the head type problems that it was then
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh they they have uh uh pretty good
 		bunch of actors and well acted parts i mean you can take a good actor and put him in a bad part and it doesn't do any good but uh they they found a good combination of roles and and actors and actresses on that show and it's a pretty good one
 	
 	
 		sure
 		it's a lot different seeing Carroll O'Connor in that role than uh Archie Bunker it's like
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and maybe a little more versatile than anybody ever gave him credit for
 	
 	
 		didn't get the
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah there're there're just starting to rerun those uh All in the Family down here on a particular on a major station and it's
 		uh i never did like it particularly and i've watched a couple of them off and on uh just to get a feel for what what was being said then but it
 		uh the i i don't know it's it's it's a pretty simplistic deal and i mean they they pound whatever message they're going to say over and over and that's about the end of it so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know if i would have liked it when it was current and and being discussed maybe it would have been a little better but uh
 	
 	
 		course the this is The Heat of the Night isn't it
 	
 	
 		no the uh the All in the Family reruns that are showing showing now
 	
 	
 		oh oh the All in the Ha Family right right right
 	
 	
 		they they really take whatever point they're wanting to make they they reiterate it over and over you know it's as if the the intelligence level of the people that watch this or something other they handle over a wide you know range of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		of uh topics but uh the uh i don't know maybe it would have been better the first time through when it was more
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh when the public was talking about it you know sit around the table and talk about the this that and the other but some of the issues seemed a little out dated but of course that's what reruns are for and
 	
 	
 		right when is relevant or
 		yeah well you've got old Meathead there and the rest of the gang at the where Meathead and and Sally Sally Struthers there with the um the the liberals
 		the the supposedly correct view at the time and then uh the Archie Bunker with his uh antiquated uh the rednecked uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		ideas i don't know it the old meets new head on and  whatever but now it's all old so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you could have another one you could have a new TV show with uh Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers in with their kids moving in and uh
 	
 	
 		right going another generation's problems
 	
 	
 		yeah and have them be uh oh i don't even know yuppies are passe now i'm not even sure what uh
 	
 	
 		what to latch on to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know well i hear one of my kiddos coming in the door so i'll wind this one up and go see what they need
 	
 	
 		okay well it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		maybe we'll cross paths again later
 	
 	
 		
  
 		all right bye-bye
 	
 	
 		um bye
