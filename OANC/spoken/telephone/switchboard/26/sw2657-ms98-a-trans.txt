 
     		
 	
 		huh okay
 	
 	
 		i don't know how much i know about this subject
 	
 	
 		well i don't know if i know anything or not but i've i've got some opinions on it see those type of people that that have the most opinions ones at don't know anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay go ahead
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well uh i've had teenagers and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective
 		uh i think this me generation has gone far too far and the young people are overly impressed
 		and i think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a more far more disadvantaged viewpoint
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though
 	
 	
 		um me either i
 		i went to college and then started working and then got married and
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they have i read somewhere
 		and i'm i'm out on a limb here some type of college uh
 		volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the uh
 		lower income brackets of the United States have you ever heard about that one
 	
 	
 		no i haven't i know that uh my sister i have a twin sister and when she graduated she went to teach in a small town down in south Texas and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in
 		a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		if it's like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to you know to live
 	
 	
 		and this is money that she's borrowed to for her college education
 	
 	
 		yeah she only taught there one year but i
 	
 	
 		but she got credits for it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's very interesting
 	
 	
 		and um i think it would be i know that also one of my cousins who uh he is in like the therapy type thing and and he was um
 		some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at uh
 		uh i mean it's a nursing home or something like that so you know if if i think that that's a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that is an excellent program i really do i like that and it's it's beneficial to the small towns too because they really really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have have a disadvantage that we don't understand because we're in the Metroplex
 	
 	
 		as far as getting yeah getting doctors and all that kind of stuff yeah
 	
 	
 		right you know if if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we could find one we wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i can see the advantage to that one
 		the Peace Corps itself is really uh uh dying out isn't it
 	
 	
 		i really don't know that much about it you know i i i think of the Peace Corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when but yeah and don't they go into other countries and stuff
 	
 	
 		it's still in existence
 		i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh dig their own wells set up their schools
 	
 	
 		things that make them yeah make them more self-supporting yeah
 	
 	
 		yes they it's not
 		a program to teach them to use the American money it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		and yes you're right i think it's a sixties program i think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he that was his big deal
 	
 	
 		but it definitely would give
 		a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see
 		what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it
 	
 	
 		right right um
 		i think i i i i've
 		singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're they're pretty good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other people's children and grandchildren mine aren't really that bad but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but there's a
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't know that you could require everyone to to do that for yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that i don't know that that would work if if somebody's
 	
 	
 		mandatory just like like the draft no
 		every time you have
 	
 	
 		was didn't really want to be there and
 		didn't have yeah i mean there'd be loopholes just like there is in anything else
 	
 	
 		they could buy their way out
 		right you know they they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat but
 		i'm wondering if there's another issue here and maybe this is why this has died out
 		can you go into and this wasn't the question but it's it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults
 		can they go in there and can anyone
 		go into
 		well out of the Kurdish community is a little bit of extreme at this time but say i think Bangladesh would have been a good example
 		or some some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and doesn't do any good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know that it does
 		i i i don't know that um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if you step back from the current issue and look at it
 		more intellectually
 		there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out
 		you know we're losing certain races of people there are people now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that are obsolete point and fact just just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people
 		that are endangered or obsolete
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out there's a German word for it that's elegant but i never can remember what it was uh
 		but but they're they're being winnowed because they're where they are they're not adapted to their environment
 		essentially
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		um and
 		uh one of the quick examples is the aborigines
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh when we were in Australia
 		uh sad little things
 		uh i felt sorry for them
 		because their society isn't there anymore and their belief system and all all their structured of theirs all the structures of their society are gone
 		essentially
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they're just kind of
 		more like a side show than anything else and that's sad but i don't think there's any way you could go uh the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people and i that don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i'm wondering if the Peace Corps is really an effective tool
 	
 	
 		well
 		and here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped
 	
 	
 		good point we've got enough without leave without a passport there's plenty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yes i think we ought to worry about our own species
 	
 	
 		and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like um during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and
 		help people in that area or people in the United States
 	
 	
 		i wonder now in and i've been out of school too long to answer this but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses
 	
 	
 		there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are social are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be
 		half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize that it's everybody's responsibility
 		to um help these people you know and not i'm not saying just give them money but i mean because they have to be taught to be yeah  i mean i know that's what my father-in-law was talking about you know when you give these people
 	
 	
 		that's the last thing you want to do
 	
 	
 		money or
 		what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um
 		more money to these people i mean and that's not really the answer i mean because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that but
 	
 	
 		yeah that's exactly it
 		they're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it now come on let's be realistic that's just not realistic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves i mean
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i guess we're getting kind of off the subject here but yeah i mean it's
 	
 	
 		no we're not i don't think i think that's more realistic than going making them go in the Peace Corps
 	
 	
 		true yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that's a lot more realistic
 		uh
 		i i think that we should be spending more time and and again i don't think the the Peace Corps is is as successful now simply because
 		it's not
 		it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh we've got plenty
 		in fact we've got far too many
 		you're in uh what  Flower Mound
 	
 	
 		Flower Mound yeah
 		so we're a little
 		farther you know farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing
 	
 	
 		i was that's exactly what i was going to ask you have you ever have have you been downtown recently
