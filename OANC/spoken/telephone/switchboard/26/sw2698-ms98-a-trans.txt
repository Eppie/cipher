 		yeah okay
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so tell me do you like football
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what
 		yeah
 		yeah i love football football professional
 	
 	
 		how could you be from Texas and not like football right
 	
 	
 		right well i'm not really from originally from Texas but uh professional football is my favorite thing to watch really
 	
 	
 		yeah so well then in in that case you're probably a devout Forty Niners fan
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah exactly i do like uh what's his name
 	
 	
 		
 
 		like what's his name
 	
 	
 		what's who's the quarterback out there
 	
 	
 		Joe Montana
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i do like him
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well i don't know if you know this but do you know that that both Roger Craig and uh
 		oh what is that linebacker's name
 		oh Ronnie Lotte
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they're not coming back
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah they've signed with another team
 	
 	
 		so they're not going to be as good this year huh
 	
 	
 		well i don't know those are two heavy duty players
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know Roger Craig and Ronnie Lotte i can't imagine you know so uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just amazing you know you i i i i hope that living there in uh in in Texas you you of course don't let anyone know that you like the Forty Niners do you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		not at all not at all i'm i'm really a a a bandwagon fan i think i like whoever is good that year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah well that's all right too
 	
 	
 		yeah i you know
 		yeah so i so i liked the Forty Niners last year
 		
 
 		but uh i like watching the Colts play because i'm from originally from Indiana and
 	
 	
 		oh oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute if  the Colts the Colts the Colts i still have trouble adjusting to that the Indiana Colts
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the Colts
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yes i guess i guess that sort of dates me but uh uh i i still think of the Colts as Baltimore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i know a lot of people do but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we like Jeff George so it's fun to watch him play being a rookie and all last year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah for sure
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i imagine speaking of football teams you guys have the what happened to Dallas what what whatever happened to Dallas
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they did the wrong thing by uh releasing Landry a few years ago
 	
 	
 		i yeah i thought they were going to lynch those people
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i i liked  Tom Landry you know i have no respect for the for the new coaching staff since they ousted him
 	
 	
 		well you know how do you get rid of an institution like that and and and and justify it i mean
 	
 	
 		oh not i know not at all
 	
 	
 		that really was kind of sad i got sort of a raw deal on that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		So uh
 	
 	
 		you you you said something you know
 		uh in in college teams you guys have some some have you got  anything promising this year as far as college teams like like uh Texas A and M
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well
 	
 	
 		or you keech up keep up with collegiate
 	
 	
 		well i have to admit i don't keep up with Texas i keep up with uh i'm from Purdue
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		and
 		and so i keep up with what's going on up there they're going to have a new coach this year from Ohio State
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh they it looks looks to be promising for Purdue within the next few years so we're looking forward to seeing their program turn around
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah well Purdue's been kind of out of it for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i i didn't know Purdue i didn't even know Purdue still had a football
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  you don't hear about them much in fact you don't even hear about their basketball team much any more but you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's how it how it goes i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah well it will be interesting to see well especially you know um uh here here in the in the bay area you know this this used to be the home also of the of the of of the Raiders and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a lot of people here still feel that the Raiders are are are are you know in are in Oakland but uh
 		i it's it's going to be real interesting to see what happens because uh there there're a lot of changes are happening here in the bay area as far as that they're talking about maybe getting a new stadium and with those guys leaving i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Feagin and and Ronnie Lotte i i i can't imagine a more devastating blow to a team you know the the uh the the top running back and the top defensive player uh leaving is
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		gee going to be interesting to see what happens
 	
 	
 		what are they going to do about Bo this year
 	
 	
 		uh Bo well i don't know what they're going to do about Bo Bo is is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is pretty much out of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i think Bo is you're talking about speaking about Bo Jackson
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		uh uh uh it just doesn't sound like that with what's wrong with him that you know we're going to find out what Bo's made out of
 	
 	
 		oh yeah some people think they're predicting that he'll make a big comeback
 	
 	
 		well uh i'm sure he wants to but i would be i'd frankly
 		extremely surprised
 	
 	
 		yeah i would be too
 	
 	
 		i really would that kind of you know that that kind of injury is not not something that
 		well i i hope he does you know more power to him i think that'd be just absolutely wonderful so do you i i guess uh uh i i've talked with a lot of folks from from Texas it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a lot of folks from Texas uh on this thing and so it's it's it's  i guess all you folks just kind of got into this thing huh but
 	
 	
 		right TI uh somehow got us on it
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's great i mean it's kind of fun i've met some great folks i really have and had some great conversations
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i bet they love to talk about uh pro football don't they
 	
 	
 		oh yeah indeed definitely
 	
 	
 		
 
 		or any football
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i i i must admit i as growing up football was really a great part of my life i grew up in North Carolina and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		south and and uh played uh football was just you know
 	
 	
 		you played football for North Carolina
