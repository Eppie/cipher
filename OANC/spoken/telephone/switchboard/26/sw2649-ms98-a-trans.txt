 
     		
 	
 		okay now uh the town i live in uh they started a recycling program
 		uh in the certain small part of town a little couple neighborhoods neighborhoods
 		and they said that they were disappointed in the response that people they tried to promote it and everything but i don't think the city necessarily supported what the they were doing uh
 	
 	
 		is this like roadside collection
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think they really uh encouraged it i don't think they really uh made it well-known how to do it uh that's my perception
 		but
 	
 	
 		well now down here we've got you know collection bins in the parks and things but there's no
 		you know there's absolutely no
 	
 	
 		yeah there used to be uh a big uh trash bin several trash bins in front of the Wal-Mart in town here that uh you could put plastic jugs on one side and newspapers on another and glass on the third
 		but uh
 		that has been taken away it's not there anymore i mean that thing was always full because people really brought stuff to it all the time and uh then they took it away for no real reason that i can understand or i ever heard about
 		and it's not there anymore and the only place to take things to recycle them is like clear off on the other side of town and who's going to do that very few people
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well i've seen you know i've seen examples of uh communities where they
 		they take the other other approach you know you you have to do it or you're fined
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and you know i'm actually all for that i don't i'm probably not the best
 		best person for recycling but i'll be damned if you know if they they didn't uh
 		charge me an extra ten bucks for garbage collection every month i'd be sure and recycle
 	
 	
 		yeah how how how do they monitor that though i wonder
 	
 	
 		i mean it's not that much trouble
 		it's just different different communities that pass the laws that say you have to have to recycle
 		you have to you have to you know on Mondays they pick up glass and on Tuesdays it's
 		you know plastics or whatever and if if you don't uh
 		if your garbage is just out there in a bag and it's not sorted you know they mark you down and
 		fine you for it shit it's kind of like
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		it's the same principal when there's a drought they fine you for using water you know they just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you don't do what they say and you
 		not that i promote over government or anything but you know the the world's in a bad enough state
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i
 		people being the way they are you kind of need some incentive
 	
 	
 		yeah it would definitely help you know even if they were to uh uh pay like for recycling aluminum or
 		uh newspapers or whatever i mean they used to be that if you well like grocery stores you buy uh pop and and you had a deposit on the bottle you bring the bottle back you get a nickel per bottle back or whatever you know that encourages you not to throw it away you'd take it back and and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and get your money back or at least exchange it for another bottle that's full you know
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		um i haven't seen that done for a long time either
 	
 	
 		yeah no deposit no return
 	
 	
 		yeah everything's no deposit no return or else it's all plastic jugs that you just pitch you know uh
 	
 	
 		i was listening to Karen DeNard the other night
 		on the way home from school you know she's got that talk show and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		KRA
 		and they were talking about you know a lot of the plastic bottles
 		you can't just throw all plastics together
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		and they were talking about you know you need legislation to uh identify what kind of plastic it this is
 		what can be recycled as what
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		because you know say shampoo bottles i think was the example they gave there's no they don't even give you any indication of what kind of plastic that is
 		you just can't throw that in with your
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		two liter Coke bottles or whatever
 	
 	
 		i wasn't aware of that i thought they were more or less all the same
 	
 	
 		yeah so did i that's that's it was news to me too i thought it was kind of interesting though
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there needs to be legislation that they should all be the same plastic
 	
 	
 		yeah they yeah that or you know things need might be identified and there needs to be a means a convenient means for people to to recycle i know for me now i've got to drive
 		a few miles down the road to do it if i want to do it and a lot of times it's the difference between doing it or not doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know is
 		whether you can like take it out the back like stick it out in the back
 		back alley for the guys to pick up when they do or
 		having to throw it in the back of your car
 	
 	
 		or at least have you know a a bunch of collection bins around the city you know if they had one
 		for every five thousand people
 		or or two thousand people
 		uh you know just scattered throughout the city you know who who wouldn't mind just you know why going down that way anyway just throw things in the back of your car and
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and take them down and throw it in there i mean i think that would be great i i'd support that entirely
 		you know as a country we produce way too much garbage it's it's it's phenomenal
 	
 	
 		yeah way too much well i know just as an individual you know i know how many times i haul out a bag of trash and it's like incredible if you multiply that times everybody
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know on my block in this city it's crazy
 	
 	
 		where i work there they have uh uh recycled paper
 		thing so you just you have two trash cans in your office one one is for the regular
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		non recyclable trash and is for paper yeah and you know i think it's great i use it all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah you're TI right
 		yeah so am i
 	
 	
 		you know and i read that the companies now save like what fifteen thousand trees or whatever because of that and i thought that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		i guess there's the other side of the issue that uh there need to be facilities for processing all this stuff and a market for recyclable goods
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		and that was something they brought up on the show i listened to was uh
 		you know there's all kinds of you know recycled paper but you know nobody's wanting to use it
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		you know how many people are using how many people do you know that use recycled paper in the office
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you can you can buy your your Moore's computer forms for your computer paper or whatever you can buy it with regular paper or recycled and
 		i'll guarantee you in my building i haven't seen recycled paper yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so at the same time we're we're doing all this effort to throw it a way and recycle it we ought to be working on the other end and
 		and paying the extra dime on on a dollar for that recycled stuff
 	
 	
 		i've always wondered why they haven't taken some of these recycled plastics and made them into like uh plastic boards to build a house with instead of making it out of wood lumber make it out of out of plastic boards
 	
 	
 		well i think they actually do some of that but again it's the cost the cost of processing that it just
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		it intimidates people you know it's easier to buy something that's
 		you know the the the cost of building is already
 	
 	
 		once again the bottom line counts
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		for it it's easy to say but for a lot of people
 		to do you know if you were building a house and you were going to spend you know fifty thousand versus twenty thousand on mat erials because your
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you're going to you're going to pay for uh technology that's not mature yet
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's a problem
 	
 	
 		what are you going to do you know you're going to spend twenty thousand and
 	
 	
 		and then right it off
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah you mean you're going to do what you can
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		well
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		that's about all i have to say tonight
 	
 	
 		i was surprised i thought this thing was shut down but i
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		i thought this whole switchboard thing was shut down i was surprised to get the call
 	
 	
 		yeah so did i but i thought i'd try one more time and sure enough it's okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		great
 	
 	
 		well thanks for talking and
 	
 	
 		all right all right bye
 	
 	
 		see you later bye
