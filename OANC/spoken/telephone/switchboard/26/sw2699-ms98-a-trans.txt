 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right so uh automobiles huh yeah what uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh
 		right now i have a Nissan Sentra and it's my first car and so i'm really  i really have grand designs on on my next car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah huh uh-huh
 		yeah uh is it a how long have you had it
 	
 	
 		uh just the about two years now yeah yeah so
 	
 	
 		about two years now how long will it be before you're ready to buy another one
 	
 	
 		oh probably another year another year or so i'm i'm working in Waco and so i probably won't buy another one until i get another job
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		i see well
 	
 	
 		so but this one i mean i like this one a lot um if i were to get a new car i it may be a Nissan a another uh Nissan
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's you uh you like driving that uh that particular brand of foreign car huh yeah yeah we we drive uh American cars right now our our daughter drives a uh
 	
 	
 		something
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a Toyota but we both drive my wife drives a Cadillac and i drive a Chevrolet
 	
 	
 		right
 		i've always heard that the foreign cars are are the you know foreign cars or the Toyota and Nissan they have good mileage it's better and they last and last my mother has a Toyota and she's she's going on about a hundred and fifty thousand miles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		on it and it's still trucking so i  she's sticking with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think i probably want uh a kind of a sportier car the one i have now is gray and i like black
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and probably like tinted windows and a nice stereo system tape player i don't have a tape player in mine which is really killing me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah yeah that that makes a makes it a little different i i i would i thought it would make a difference when i got my car it has a tape player in it but i don't use it a lot
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i do listen to the radio all the time i like having that stereo radio with the it's got the equalizer in it
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		right the problem with that in Waco is there's not many stations and so you pretty much depend on tapes  and CDs etcetera and so on because there's not a whole lot of stations to listen to um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		do you do a lot of driving or just just
 	
 	
 		what
 		pretty much yeah i not in my own personal car i drive a lot in my uh company car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um my personal car i usually just drive to work and back or to the mall or something but not a whole lot i do drive back and forth to Dallas a lot in that car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well our
 	
 	
 		and that's probably wearing it down quite a bit
 	
 	
 		i guess we could say my wife's car is the family car and we don't you know she drives it to and from work it's about it's you know what the most of its driving is my car is my business car and i drive quite a bit you know in my for my business role
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		if you were to get another kind of car what would it be
 	
 	
 		well i probably will stick with an American car American made car i i like the size you know the little bit larger car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we do tend to travel a bit and it's we just enjoy the you know the ride better for for longer trips
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh so
 	
 	
 		i do tend to like riding in American cars i've just never had one so i i can't really compare
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		so yeah i've had i haven't had a a foreign car myself you know for my own personal personal use in a long time i had a little Volkswagen Beetle one time
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		the big problem with a foreign car my father he drove or he always forever and ever he's had Audis and those German cars and they're so expensive to get fixed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		and that that's a big
 		big uh minus sign  for the foreign cars
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i have some uh i have some business acquaintances that drive Jaguars and uh you know i really like the looks of those but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh and i rode in one of them uh not too long ago and it it has a pretty good ride at least riding in the backseat was pretty good you know so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so it you know its when i when i move up a little bit in uh in price range that you know that's what i've kind of got my eye on is you know is maybe looking at one of those but
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		i think i've got my eye on a Maxima when my price range  is in reach
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		what do you think about the about all the new vans that are out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i i'm not uh really not too interested in a van myself i have seen you know seen them running around town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i'm not too crazy about the looks of them and they look like some of them look like they might be dangerous you're so so you'd be sitting right up on the front with a lot of glass
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right up uh-huh
 		but it it it would seem to me as if i was sitting in a bullet
 	
 	
 		that
 		right
 	
 	
 		of some sort and i'm right in the front you know it's
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but then you know there's a i think one of them does have a a little more of a front end on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but then uh then some of them i like the looks of that better you know to have have a little more vehicle in front of you between you and the oncoming traffic seems to me it'd be a little safer
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		uh
 		i don't know i think i'll probably be hanging on to my Nissan for a while i guess here
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 		
 
 	
 	
 		move up as i move up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah have you how how about uh how do the tires last on that car have you had to put tires on i
 	
 	
 		so
 		i haven't had to put any tires on it and they're they're still they still have tread on them and everything i probably will have to change them here soon but
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's
 		yeah i think that is one of the things that you find on the foreign cars is that you know that some of the things that might cost you a little more but they last longer you know tires brakes and things like that might
 	
 	
 		right right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		might last a little
 	
 	
 		yeah this car i haven't had any problem at all except for uh a couple of weeks ago the it completely like shut down and it really shouldn't have done this because it's it's relatively new car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it completely shut down it wouldn't it just started going it went in drive and just kept driving i would put it in rear it kept going straight so i just drove it to the Nissan place and they said that it looked like i'd bumped something underneath the car
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i knew i hadn't bumped anything but i had taken it to Sears for an oil change a couple of days before and i'm thinking they did took a screw out or bumped something or something and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they might have let it let the  the uh lift down with something underneath it
 	
 	
 		exactly that's what i was thinking because i know i haven't done anything to it and so i really haven't had any other problems except for that which i don't think would have been a problem
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		had i taken it somewhere else or something
 	
 	
 		well it sounds like you you you it sounds like you've got your plans all made though anyway to stick
 	
 	
 		but yeah i haven't had any problems at all
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		stick with that car
 	
 	
 		yes yep
 	
 	
 		well it's been uh been interesting interesting talking to you and uh well okay thanks uh-huh bye-bye
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's been good talking to you too okay thank you bye-bye
