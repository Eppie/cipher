 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		go ahead
 	
 	
 		okay do i still can't still can feel that the Soviet Union as such is still a threat to the civilized western world absolutely
 		and my reasons are based upon not only from what i read in the newspapers what i see on the newspapers but up against some of the
 		fun and exciting things i ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group
 	
 	
 		um
 		okay
 		i guess i don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be but i think just the instability of the country right now uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well that's what makes it a powder keg
 	
 	
 		so scary
 	
 	
 		the um
 		i'll go back in time a little bit to about eighty one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when my first real involvement with the military started
 		um
 		naturally we were at the time the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat so we got lots quite a bit of
 		information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i went to Lebanon in eighty three before the marines ever got there with the UN Peace Keeping Force
 		and with the training i received prior to going there with captured weapons we kept running up against
 		these weren't these weren't Chinese made copies these were Soviet made top of the line fresh out of the box AK-47s
 	
 	
 		um uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as well as a lot of the explosives we were running into
 		in Granada in October twenty fifth eighty three we invaded the place
 		sure there were Cuban soldiers there but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots
 		the team i was with we jumped in on the western tip of of the island down on Point Salinas
 		and for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons
 		in eighty four
 		i was down in Central America as an advisor to the Honduran army
 		again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit plus Soviet advisors
 		and the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate Soviet made material
 		do i consider them a threat absolutely
 		they have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University
 		about like A and M or UT where they're teachings subjects like that they're teaching terrorism
 		some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place and let me tell you they are nothing nice to go up against
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more
 		incidents than they did
 		these guys are top of the line
 		when they when they graduate from there
 		they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world
 		and they are very very good at what they do
 		so until i see the entire
 		quote old guard
 		of the Soviet military of the Soviet government
 		completely roll over and disappear preferably buried
 		i still consider them a threat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		their military is different from ours to where there are extremist generals generals that actually control tens and thousands
 		of troops
 		that irregardless of what Soviet policy is they're going to do what the general tells them
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess that's what concerns me the most is they're they're so unstable that somebody like that could make uh decisions that would
 		jeopardize a lot of people
 	
 	
 		well it's interesting interesting watching the different Soviet states Albania Lithuania
 		doing their little revolts down there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there
 		so far they hadn't run into the real psychos yet
 		there's probably five or six which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs that are in positions over some of these Soviet states
 		if uprisings happen happen in their sectors
 		it is it's going to be a total blood bath
 	
 	
 		yeah it looks like it's come close to that as it is
 	
 	
 		actually they're showing remarkable restraint
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they get real nasty the Hyundee helicopters come out and they
 		would level entire areas
 		okay you're from the Dallas area right
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay you know basically the size of uh the area around Richardson
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you put five Soviet Hyundee helicopters in the air they can level the entire area and there won't be anything left alive
 		and they can do that in about four minutes
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by
 		they used them in Afghanistan did remarkably remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in
 		but on a highly populated area like some of the Soviet cities would be
 		with the weaponry that's attached on those things there is no place to hide
 		if the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then the then the nerve gas definitely will get you
 		the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time
 		they drink that much fuel
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		were you have you i take it you haven't spent any time in the military
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		as a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military
 		i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in never did make the newspapers but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		during that same time frame didn't you get some feeling that i mean they're getting all these weapons and stuff
 		didn't it
 		it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff
 	
 	
 		you mean in the in the most recent conflict
 	
 	
 		in any of them since eighty one
 	
 	
 		oh yeah definitely i i'm i'm a little bit shocked to what the US has done in terms of selling to Iraq
 		in the past ten to fifteen years
 		yeah i think we we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too it's bad enough that the Soviets do it
 	
 	
 		it all boils down to whether it's our side their side it's a matter of money to a certain extent
 	
 	
 		um uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the deal the Iraqi's have with the Russians was for oil
 	
 	
 		yeah it's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons
 		especially when it's to the south of us
 	
 	
 		uh the ones to the south are more regional conflict
 		they're not really that worried about
 		invading north
 		they're more interested in they've got a screwed up situation i'll give them that
 		from Mexico all the way down into Central Central and South America the situation down there is weird and it's very screwed up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		inflation is out of this world and the governments which
 		our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out
 		and generally the people are getting screwed and they're tired of it and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well i think Russia is getting to the point where they're they're about to do something to get out of communism i guess i'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin
 		to get more power i think Gorbachev has about had his day
 	
 	
 		unfortunately Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard
 		that's the only drawback that i see with the entire thing Gorbachev has m ade his attempt and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Yeltsin's in tight wi th the old guard
 		so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils at this point
 	
 	
 		uh-huh true
 		i don't know i sure wouldn't turn my back on them
 	
 	
 		you mean i understand when they pulled the troops out of uh
 		or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down i thought that was great
 		but by no means do i
 		endorse or approve pulling everybody out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it may be
 		a much reduced force than what we used to have over there
 		but you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if it's a regional conflict
 		if
 		United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is
 		not only does it it can talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk it's got to have the stuff to back it back up what it's saying
 		if you've only got a token force there you can't hold your ground
 	
 	
 		at least they're learning a little bit from history i mean uh
