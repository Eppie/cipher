 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well um what  what do you think about the metric system uh do you uh find it usable have you tried much with it
 	
 	
 		well with with an engineering degree it's of course it's a whole lot easier
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum to use you mean uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because uh
 		yeah if if somebody had is totally unfamiliar with it uh human nature being what it is we don't like to change
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh it just makes absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum well i've i've lived
 		both in the United States and and in a country where they do use the metric system and uh so i've i've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over um
 		the secret seeming to me is to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and pounds to kilometers
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh kilograms and i think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute an inch is two point fifty four centimeters how on earth am i every going to do the math
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail or whatever and
 		you know  and leaving it at that
 		and uh you know a kilogram weighs about this much and get used to it from scratch cause i still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters but i'm perfectly comfortable using either
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think the real problem with this this weird conversion you see signs that say fifty five miles per hour and you know whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour you know people you know it's hard to take it seriously
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and as long as both were given you basically just don't read the kilometers per hour you just say well look read the miles per hour one the other one must be for someone else
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know i mean even Britain has converted over and we inherited this mess from them and uh
 	
 	
 		that's right it's all their fault
 	
 	
 		well i mean it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they they saw the light
 		um i don't know why they were um were more able than we were except i think that they probably just said well we're just going to start using the things now
 		and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to
 	
 	
 		of course being part of the European community if everybody else did it they they were probably much more is much more necessary for them than for us
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true that's that's probably true and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way  rather than adopting you know some other model
 	
 	
 		well
 		uh there's an expression for that with eyes on the past backing confidently into the future
 	
 	
 		i've never heard that one that's very nice
 		oh so i'm all for the metric system and converting over and i think i guess my feeling is the way to do it is is to just start giving weights you know have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers
 		or just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and uh
 		just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert remember me getting a package of something that said one pound
 		is a package of dates mind you it's was presumably something you weigh fairly precisely it said one pound  and then in parenthesis it said four hundred and fifty four point six grams
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and as near as i could tell seeing that was basically antimetric propaganda cause anyone who would say well look i can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty four point six grams which of course they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway um
 		every time i see something like that i think well that's that's an antimetric argument
 	
 	
 		yep well i i don't think it'll it could ever happen with with a quick transition
 	
 	
 		you don't
 	
 	
 		no i i think that would be the easiest way but human nature being such as it is
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i would think it would take probably two or three years before people could could completely cut the cord
 	
 	
 		yeah oh oh that's what i was thinking by quick transition i didn't mean you know i didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything you know  at midnight tonight we all switch over or anything
 	
 	
 		did they switch
 	
 	
 		uh i believe so yeah and i think they did it overnight cause you know you can't do it gradually  that's an example of something you can't do gradually
 	
 	
 		well that's true it it has to be kind of a discreet transaction
 	
 	
 		yes it does  a quantum leap from left to right hand drive
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they but you know that must have taken uh that was something that had to be done quickly you know because of external circumstances but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe or the rest of continental Europe and
 	
 	
 		interesting
 		oh yes
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know but that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate um
 	
 	
 		i'm sure
 	
 	
 		so i i i i i think it's essential that it's done and i think the real trick is to avoid the
 		you know a little more attention to human psychology and whereas people want round numbers and after all the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers so they don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch and so what the exact
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented really i think
 	
 	
 		well we do have the two liter soda pop bottles
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i saw that i saw that the other day i don't don't drink soda pop but i saw a two liter soda pop bottle so yeah things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		are a good start and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the
 		pounds come in the the you know the odd numbers you know  two point two pounds or something i think people will start getting a sense of gee the metric is the sensible one
 	
 	
 		right yes
 		that's true
 		well sure have enjoyed our talk
 	
 	
 		yes well get back to what you're doing and i'll do the same i enjoyed talking with you too  okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay God bless bye-bye
