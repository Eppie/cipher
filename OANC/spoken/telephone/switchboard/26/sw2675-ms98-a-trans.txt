 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there you go
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well well Jean the subject is uh jury trials and should the jury recommend
 		uh sentencing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		now my personal opinion uh i don't know uh uh here lately it seems
 		well up until a few years ago i guess there there was uh there just too many liberals about and permitting too many
 		oh they just broaden the the human rights in to to cover just about everybody everybody and i don't think uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		those guilty of committing capital crimes should be uh permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned loose on parole it's just not right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i think i agree with that very much i do you
 	
 	
 		and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing
 	
 	
 		i do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves
 		in a position like that and say i would never do something like that and it's hard for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done
 	
 	
 		uh yes very possibly so many of us have led led sheltered lives that uh when we go into a sit in on a a a jury i've never done it myself
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		i never have either
 	
 	
 		unfortunately i wish i could have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh is there a reason why you have never
 	
 	
 		i've just never been called up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh my husband works as a policeman so i always assumed that that was why i was never called uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well now that's possible
 		but uh i was called up as an an alternate once but i never made it to the jury
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury
 	
 	
 		not that i know of
 	
 	
 		somebody told me the other day that there is what what they call a six man jury and i had never heard of such thing and i wondered if it was true
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh i've never heard of it
 	
 	
 		i never had either but i just wondered uh another question was uh should a criminal case uh should the jury be unanimous on their decision
 		and that i wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not
 	
 	
 		uh well there again uh
 		i suppose it should be
 	
 	
 		that would mean they all would have to decide
 	
 	
 		exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		one way or the other
 	
 	
 		is it guilt or innocence but then again so many times uh you get one or two holdouts and and it permits the criminals to get a retrial
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and now that that's not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances i mean that's happened
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh giving them another another another trial might give them additional time to uh prove their innocence
 	
 	
 		bring some of these things out um-hum
 	
 	
 		yes uh we can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials
 	
 	
 		uh apparently there are i i i since my husband worked as a policeman i can't believe there are very many
 		people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of i have i still have a little bit of a problem with that
 	
 	
 		hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh but i would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the person wrong person at the right time
 	
 	
 		oh that's it and you just might resemble somebody
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		out here in Texas we had a a a a
 		great miscarriage of justice here it was finally after nine years it was finally uh
 		uh uh taken care of we had a a a black man was accused simply because he resembled uh someone who stuck who who held up a uh a a 7-Eleven i think it was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		ah um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and even though he had witnesses that said that uh he was at work and he had all sorts of of a uh character witnesses and whatnot
 	
 	
 		they still found him guilty
 	
 	
 		they
 		they found him guilty
 	
 	
 		when people said he was at work
 	
 	
 		well they said it was that this happened during lunch time and he could have disappeared uh gotten away at lunch time and uh committed the robbery
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but after nine years well as a matter of fact they made a TV show about it after nine years they finally uh came up with evidence and proved to prove that he was innocent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh for heaven's sake so there's nine years of that man's life gone um-hum
 	
 	
 		exactly now that just was not fair
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh yeah i guess that's where a lot of the problem lies we're we try bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial
 	
 	
 		so
 		yes unfortunately that's what happens
 	
 	
 		and yeah
 		and we often forget about the one that the injustice has been done to
 		because i bet they still say our system is the best in the world
 	
 	
 		well it's not the uh uh it's it's it's not the best system but it's the best one in the world
 	
 	
 		yeah it's the best one that exists i guess so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and unfortunately we just have to put up with a lot of things and they they trying to solve them and everything and but uh oh i don't know i think the Supreme Court
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i'm i'm i'm still rankled about their decision to permit burning of the flag
 	
 	
 		oh i think a lot of people are i think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country
 	
 	
 		well it the the uh the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh uh oh that just rankles me no i swear if i ever saw somebody that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh burning burning a flag i'd i'd try to kill them i would
 	
 	
 		that bad huh  i wouldn't like it but i don't know if i'd go that far
 	
 	
 		well i happen to be a flag freak i served i was in the service i was in Korea
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		well i saw what the red in the flag represents
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think pride in our country and our flag is is so important it's important in so many facets of our life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i i i feel like if they don't people don't like what our flag stands for they're welcome to go some place else exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah see what they
 	
 	
 		there's nobody holding them here
 	
 	
 		see what how they like it under another flag
 	
 	
 		right they'd soon be back i'm sure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well Jean we seem to be of of uh uh
 		the same uh uh opinions here i hope they get something out of this
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i don't know about the judge making the decision if that's do you think that's good you know like if a jury
 	
 	
 		oh passing sentence well uh uh yes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yes but i i think the jury should be able to recommend
 	
 	
 		make a recommendation do they sometimes make a recommendation that's what i was thinking they they sometimes do
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh yes yes
 		uh i don't know if that's a regular procedure or what
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh i know i'm always hearing that uh well the jury came in with a guilty guilty verdict and they recommended uh twenty years or something
 	
 	
 		and they recommend some yeah and then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of course uh now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence uh they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time but actually their chance course when a lot of times when they come up for a parole they're denied it depends on you know what they're what they'd been guilty of and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and a lot of different things i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah but too many times they they are permitted permitted to go out on parole and
 	
 	
 		um-hum a lot slip through the the protective whatever they have to do and and there are bad ones that do slip back out and
 		end up hurting somebody again
 	
 	
 		yes they just go out and repeat their crimes
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		well there well they say after after three offenses why it's automatically life in prison but i think they ought to make it two offenses
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i always thought there was there was wrong it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family
 		got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody it seemed like there sometimes there's not a good the balance isn't right it doesn't make sense
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh yeah very true well here again now there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so so frequently
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh race or nationality even
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		so
 	
 	
 		but uh like you said it's uh it's it's it's not the best system but it's the best one we've got
 	
 	
 		yeah right so let's put up with it i guess improve it if we can if we ever get a chance so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure enough
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		Jean it's been awful nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		well it's been nice talking to you Jack and uh i hope you have a real good day and week
 	
 	
 		well let's hope neither one of us ever have to run into this this uh with subject we've been discussing take care now bye
 	
 	
 		i hope not  you too bye-bye
