 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		i guess i'll start um one uh big thing that the advise that i would give to a parent to give to his or her child is
 		to let their let their child experience college
 		in a kind of general sense i like large colleges because i went to University of Texas at Austin they have fifty thousand students there and i feel like that now if i went
 		if i had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that i wouldn't have have gotten as much exposure to different people and different uh
 		i don't know different languages different cultures and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students
 	
 	
 		that's interesting i went to a smaller school  of probably three thousand thirty five hundred and i i i thought that was the best experience in that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we had more one-on-one since we seemed to know everyone on campus and we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and backgrounds and so forth so i thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number um
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		one of fifty thousand i was one of three thousand and and you know different perspectives i uh but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of sort of thing
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum yeah
 		yeah yeah i i could see i could see that point i could see how it would be i'm sure your classes were a lot smaller um because like we would have biology classes that did main courses that everyone has to take i mean hundreds of students in this class so actually yes you were a number
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um i i just i don't know i'm thinking in a sense of uh
 		just being exposed to more
 		it just seems like in a larger college you i don't know you're exposed to so many more people from all over the world and i'm sure a lot of people come to you know small colleges also but just that they're more
 		of of the different cultures there not that it not that it's better but i'm just saying that i think that big
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		that's one thing to definitely consider
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh i think uh a lot of a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college a lot of the students that i talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor um
 		they or they're considering going to Baylor they're also considering going to UT Austin but one of the big
 		no no is because of the fifty thousand students and i have to tell them that just like just Waco like i live in Waco it's a large city i can still function in my own kind of
 		area in my own group i have a job i have my friends and i'm really not as as concerned about the entire city so when you go to a big
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a big university you're not as concerned about the entire university but your group of friends your classes your interests your clubs and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think that's probably key to me is not so much the size of the school but what what are the particular needs of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the students and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this um larger university setting some of the students um when i was when i was teaching school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		would not have been comfortable with that they needed uh at at least at first
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		they needed a smaller setting that that was more like family where they could get one-on-one from from teachers professors and so forth and then after a year or two move on to
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a little bit bigger pond where where when they had a little more self-confidence built up oh yes i can do this oh i've done this before it's just in a bigger setting and so maybe to me
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		the key would be what what are what are the child's the the student's needs and what what school or schools can best meet those those needs besides education you you you can expect
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		all of them with uh uh uh accreditation accreditation to give the education
 		but it's these other things that you and i are are keying off on that that are really more of an education that but they're the things that don't show up in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		on paper um-hum exactly that's that's one important thing that i think about school i'm i'm not a kind a person that i didn't i i was kind of a B student i guess you'd say and i didn't really
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		i was  i strived strived to be an A student but it wasn't like a real priority to my my priority was just
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		being as worldly as i could possibly be  getting into as many organizations as i could possibly could and and one other point i was going to make was that i can understand i can see that probably if i had gone to a smaller school i would probably have
 		more friends
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		because you like you said you know
 		you know everybody knows everybody and so you probably come out of it knowing and by friends i mean like contacts for when you get out of school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um you know you just you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with more so at a small college then a large college you may have gone to school with them but you wouldn't you wouldn't know them uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college
 	
 	
 		i guess i guess now i've been out for i i'm i'm older than you i've been out for twenty one years and i was looking at an annual last night uh something had sparked it sparked a question and i went to a
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		small private school um and it was church related and i got to looking at my class of sixty nine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here and i've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years
 		where i go to church now there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as i and it it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same
 	
 	
 		wow
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		memories if not the same
 		education education in you know we we weren't all out to be teachers or or whatever so we didn't have the same classes but we had a common thread something that still ties us together twenty odd years later
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		wow
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		and it's it's it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		those are what i carry beyond just that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at TI
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i have something more important to me than that
 	
 	
 		that's great that's great yeah that's what i that's basically what i and when i first i've been out of college only two years now so it's still pretty fresh on my memory um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but now that i'm out when i went into school my parents told
 		well my father okay let me let me go back to my my sister now is is in college and my father was really interested in getting her in a school that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		would look good on her on her uh diploma etcetera and so forth and and i kept pushing her towards
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just kind of U UT or a larger school
 		and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics and i wanted her to get
 		the life experience out of it and so it was you know she went the academic way because she's a straight A student which is yeah yeah yeah so she you know that's probably
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i was going to ask who won
 	
 	
 		you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and
 	
 	
 		in in that case uh regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed and finding a school that that met her specific requirements and and made the best fit for her
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		and that that's another point is that the a parent should tell their child to be
 		or or to give their child the leeway to choose their school not so much choose the school for them but you know kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think it helps uh uh now my grandfather was going to pay if i went to uh what's now UT Arlington because it was there in my hometown i could live at home but i chose to go to another school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and even though he was pleased that it was a church related school he was not willing to pay any at all even the same amount of money and and i think i value my my education more because i had to work for it
 	
 	
 		hum
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		and because i knew all along that's what i wanted even even though i had to buck the family in order to to do what i needed to do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right well that was pretty courageous
 	
 	
 		so um i i guess i guess it was it was my mother's support that got me through it that and ten years of of uh loans  after i got out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah yeah i i'm
 		i'm dealing with the loans right now  so so oh yes very every every month  that memory just shoots back in my mailbox
 	
 	
 		sounds familiar huh your it's very fresh in your memory
 		well
 		uh yeah
 		yes well sorry about that Tanya
 	
 	
 		so oh well i guess i'll get over it  but oh yeah yeah okay
 	
 	
 		i'm sure it was worth it though
 		if if nothing else because i work in training at TI now if nothing else just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		those experiences beyond and and including your educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve whatever you set your mind on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the you you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to make to give you the the potential to do whatever you wanted
 	
 	
 		right because when you when you do want when you do finally graduate
 		that that's what you need the most i'm finding out now that what i'm needing the most now is not smarts not what i can do on paper it's stamina courage uh
 		words it
 	
 	
 		young lady you have gotten your education then that's that's right
 	
 	
 		yes i'm needing you know myself i'm needing to rely on myself and i think i learned a lot of that in school too
 	
 	
 		yeah
