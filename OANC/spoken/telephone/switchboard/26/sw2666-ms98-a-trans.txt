 
     		
 	
 		well i guess uh the topic uh being favorite TV shows i uh i guess i could start by saying i'm just looking forward to uh watching the astronomers on PBS
 	
 	
 		oh yes that
 	
 	
 		and uh unfortunately they're having a  like but they're having the uh a uh not telethon but a uh auction on on PBS here and
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		i'd noticed that in the in the TV Guide and i'd totally forgotten all about that
 	
 	
 		um-hum and
 	
 	
 		and it looks like it would be an a good series
 	
 	
 		well the first uh episode started out pretty slow but after that it uh obviously has been preempted by the auction the last week or so so it uh i guess i'll never know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh and you
 	
 	
 		oh i i have a very wide range of uh uh different shows that i like uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it's i mean i mean even the what is it America's Funniest Videos there's just there's something about that i don't i don't know if it's the simplicity of it or just the total stupidity of it  that is good
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		
 
 		yeah well it's it is enjoyable i'll give you that it's funny
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh uh i i don't i don't get to watch TV that often or sit back and enjoy it i have a nine month old so that occupies a lot of the time
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		i would imagine about the only time i usually preempt for i think like Monday night we usually uh watch a lot of TV because that's when Murphy Brown and uh and Designing Women a lot of those shows are on we tend to watch always catch those
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah those are good i like uh In the Heat of the Night
 	
 	
 		and
 		In the Heat of the Night
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that's uh that is Carroll O'Connor yeah
 	
 	
 		uh yeah right uh that that's had some good episodes to it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then plus and then of course you have to have at least one soap opera
 	
 	
 		well okay
 	
 	
 		uh right i i i mean at least Knot's Landing or something on that order
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess i guess now that they've uh got rid of Dallas which we uh we tend to watch religiously here at uh at at least we're getting ready for the big final episode
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right i've been uh i tend to i try to catch that every now and then and i mean you still catch up with it you know every couple of weeks
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		it's it's funny how they're uh now that the show's over they're kind of trying to complete all of these uh stories
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in a very short period of time so it's like you turn on about eighty seven things happen in an episode now
 	
 	
 		right yeah i been trying to catch it the last few weeks so i can see how it ends
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		um-hum i guess uh the only rumor i've heard that they had in the papers so far is that uh the last episode is supposed to be like uh it's a wonderful life for JR
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		so it's uh what what would life had been like if he would had not been born there something like that so uh it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		should be interesting right lots of tongue in cheek
 	
 	
 		it's going to be funny i bet
 		something something tells me Larry Hagman's going to milk this role that uh all it's worth
 	
 	
 		right he's uh uh with him producing it it it he hasn't done a bad job
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		no no not at all not at all that's uh that's true
 		but
 	
 	
 		we uh sort of get a kick out of the Simpsons
 	
 	
 		oh do you i i very rarely unfortunately it it comes on a little early here and i sometimes i'm usually at work but they moved it to Thursdays and i guess that's what uh
 		but uh yeah the the few times that i've been able to see it it's uh at first i didn't think so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when i first saw it i i haven't been able to see it very often but when i first saw it i said well well this looks like it's it's going to you know go over like a lead balloon it uh doesn't look like it's going to be good at all
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but the few times i've seen it i guess it's something that grows on you
 	
 	
 		it it definitely grows on you and you think that it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so far fetched you know with the normal family life that uh but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		every now and then they'll surprise you and have a moral to it and they do the right thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		the the big thing i always hear about is i guess at the beginning they always open it a little differently where they all run to the sofa
 	
 	
 		yeah right and uh the things that uh Bart will write on the uh chalk board at school
 	
 	
 		yeah that's it and then sometimes you know the it's like one episode i guess the sofa wasn't even there and they all just stood there and looked at each other and and stuff like that so so i hear a lot about that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh it's almost it's almost up there with uh Saturday Night Live i guess is the big now with that is the the guy with uh
 		you know like Steve uh Steve Meister and and it's like wherever i go anymore i've uh i get got a chance not only to to visit a few companies and all that around here and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's like you walk into a lobbies of those places it's like you know Ralph Ralph Meister Ralphster and uh it's uh
 	
 	
 		right we do that a lot at work
 	
 	
 		yep so it's like that's something that's really really taken off but uh
 	
 	
 		right uh yeah there there're a lot of things come off of Saturday Night Live that uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		get caught up into the normal everyday routine
 	
 	
 		right right because uh isn't that special i guess is the last one with uh with the church lady but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		and uh
 		oh what was the one that Gilda Radner did
 	
 	
 		oh uh
 		uh it's always not it's always something but uh
 	
 	
 		oh and and i'm i'm and i'm real good at it too well well no it's not in that special that uh well anyway but you know what i'm saying there's you know things will get picked up from it and uh
 	
 	
 		when she
 		oh what was that
 		yeah uh-huh
 		um-hum get caught in the regular conversation anymore
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		right oh yeah well TV's on constantly here whenever we're at home
 	
 	
 		well especially if you have a nine month that nine month old that probably how about uh have you watched the the what's that new show Baby Talk or or the one with where they take off of Who's Talking
 	
 	
 		uh i've seen one of  i've seen one part of an episode
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't seen any of it yet but was it was it any good
 	
 	
 		it didn't do anything for me i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh uh we like Look Who's Talking you know and this just wasn't anything to me like it
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know with uh wasn't it Bruce Willis that did the voice but uh you know there's just something with that
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 		i guess we're also looking forward to the uh boy it's it's terrible that i guess we watch so much television but uh i guess the one other thing we're watching for i guess LA Law has uh last couple couple episodes coming up here
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right i've been catching that that's been real interesting
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		that was that was so wild when they when they got rid of uh the one uh actress uh Dey
 	
 	
 		yes the one that fell down the yes
 	
 	
 		a an elevator shaft that was that was pretty  it's like we we were all
 	
 	
 		i was like wait i missed that rewind rewind rewind here
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah it was like we were all sitting here going what just happened  i'd say if you if if you if you weren't watching it was like boom you missed it and it's like next thing you know they're all just looking down the shaft going you know what happened
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh so it uh and now with uh all the lawyers you know rising in arms and going off to join uh Michael i guess whoever uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum it looks like it's gonna the last few episodes are going to be good
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah matter of fact uh i guess that's going to be the same same same uh what Dallas and uh LA Law and a lot of these are really uh i guess are really going for a lot of cliffhangers this year
 	
 	
 		right and well and LA Law is getting rid of several of their characters
 	
 	
 		and they keep uh
 		that's what i heard i guess uh like like Susan Dey and a few of them are up for contract renewal and they didn't do it or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh see i heard that uh they wanted to keep it fresh and did not have the same ones there forever and so they would be bringing in new ones or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		yeah because i
 		it it's pretty obvious though like Corbin Benson is probably not going to be there long because he's been starring in these uh miniseries and and his part's gotten smaller and smaller and they're bringing on the uh like the British uh lawyer who uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess her and and the blonde uh district attorney or went went to teach that seminar to the Russian uh Russian lawyers at the uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh yeah uh
 		at the swimming pool
 	
 	
 		at the swimming pool there in Palm Springs and uh you can see they're really starting to build up their characters and they've they've kind of really down played like uh Corbin Benson and uh few of those uh the top ones Harry Hamlin a lot of them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah see i think
 		yeah and those i know that those three were supposed to leave and i don't remember about uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		oh what is it uh Sprinchez
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know if i don't know if he's supposed to leave either or not
 	
 	
 		oh really huh
 	
 	
 		but uh are you out on the west coast
 	
 	
 		uh no i'm in the uh where i'm in Texas
 	
 	
 		oh you're in Texas okay
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you mentioned the time and i was i uh the time frame and i got confused there
 	
 	
 		oh with the Simpsons and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah because i i because i guess it's on at seven o'clock on on Thursdays yeah and sometimes i don't uh don't usually make it that on on that late in the week
 	
 	
 		right on Thursdays yeah
 	
 	
 		usually by then i'm working a little later and later it seems and uh and never get home to watch it but uh it was better when it was on Saturday i couldn't uh didn't have an excuse then
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh oh well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well i guess uh guess we've run out of TV shows haven't we
 	
 	
 		right we've we've covered a lot of them
 	
 	
 		i guess uh you show it shows we you too Michelle you have a good evening bye-bye
