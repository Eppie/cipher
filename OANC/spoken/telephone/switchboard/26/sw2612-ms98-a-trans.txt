 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well i've been sort of out of it for a little while so i don't know really what's going on
 	
 	
 		well there there's been some interesting stuff going on locally but i suppose nationally the big thing is probably uh the
 		reaction to the war in the Gulf
 	
 	
 		yeah all the Democrats trying to show that yeah oh oh gosh we really did support it i mean  just because we wanted to impeach him doesn't mean anything
 	
 	
 		trying to cover themselves
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah there's been uh same thing locally here a couple of uh we got a Senator who uh
 		went on national TV and said that you know if Bush tried to do anything over there without Congressional approval they should impeach him and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true there there's a lot of talk over there that i don't think anyone imagined that it could possibly be as as successful and and painless as it had been
 	
 	
 		then
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so they figured a little bit of opposition was safe but it didn't turn out that way
 	
 	
 		sure
 		no uh i don't know i i i usually don't talk politics with people especially strangers because it's a good way to get into an argument but
 	
 	
 		well that's why that's why being strangers is safe we can
 	
 	
 		it's it's probably safer at least now can't get hit this way you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh i i don't know i'm i've been Republican for as long as i can remember and the Democrats are just so disorganized and they have been
 	
 	
 		that's true i i've been Democrat for since i've been voting which isn't that long but i'll agree with you there that there's not much organization going on
 	
 	
 		yeah they uh
 		yeah i i don't know it
 		right around the turn of uh oh gosh  i should say the eighties now now
 		it's already the nineties i forgot i forget that too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they they just haven't seemed to been able to hit anything
 		uh on the head
 		every every time they go one way the wind is always blowing the other which is
 	
 	
 		well that's true but i suppose it's hard to judge from the eighties because um Reagan was just so overwhelming to them i think they're seeing some of that unraveling these days but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah no i don't i don't know how they're going uh i i you know i'm looking i'm looking at the upcoming elections and i'm trying to think who are they going to put up
 	
 	
 		well they've already got uh oh jeez
 		there's there's there's already one candidate that i know of on the Democratic end and i keep thinking there's a second one uh Paul Tsongas
 	
 	
 		oh Tsongas
 	
 	
 		yeah uh out of Massachusetts i think
 	
 	
 		yeah i wouldn't mind him too much he's a pretty good guy he's been around and he's he keeps a low profile and doesn't go after the the headlines and stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i've i've i've heard the name but that that's the extent of my my information about him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i would be interested to see if Sam Nunn decides to go this time i i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		try to get the conservative candidate for once
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean if out out of all the Democrats that i could think to run i would he is one that i would i would definitely like to see
 	
 	
 		that that would be interesting i i must admit i haven't been really enthusiastic about the Democratic entrants
 		in the last couple of run throughs
 	
 	
 		well i'll tell you if they if they do it like they did uh
 		the last time around it's not going to be very exciting
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know um i mean let's face Dukakis and Bentsen and Bentsen
 		good grief surely they could have done better than that course they they had a they had themselves between a rock and a hard place they had on the one hand they had Jesse Jackson with all that support
 		and on the other they knew very
 	
 	
 		but completely unelectable and
 	
 	
 		oh sure and and they could not give him the nomination
 	
 	
 		true it's it's probably their their their troubles probably stem from the fact that they're such a diverse party
 	
 	
 		uh i
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the nominating rules these days are so um pseudo democratic i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you can't have the people in the back rooms deciding well who could we really get elected instead there's so much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i mean i mean they were really stuck because here they were everybody was expecting Jesse Jesse to get at least the VP nomination
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh certainly not presidential but but quite possibly VP
 		and here they are they they know very well they can't do it because if they do it's going to split the party
 		and if they do it they're going to alienate a whole bunch of others
 		so i mean they were stuck one way or the other yeah it was an interesting thing i was laughing through the whole thing uh
 	
 	
 		true i suppose being on the other side of the aisle it probably made good comic theater
 	
 	
 		yeah i it it it was it was it was comical i i sat there and watched the just watched CNN and just giggle all night you know uh oh this is great George Bush is in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		and i think Bush has turned out to be a lot better President than people gave him credit for
 	
 	
 		i i must admit i'm i'm still i i still find him a little uninspiring he he seems like a reasonably competent
 	
 	
 		yeah he is he
 		yeah he he is
 	
 	
 		person to sort of
 		do do some caretaking to um
 	
 	
 		yeah and and i i wonder the you know if if that's i mean that that really that really should be all we need in a president someone who is capable of managing
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		and that's all a president is anyway just a manager
 	
 	
 		sort of set the agenda and and let let people do the work it's it's unfortunate how how little domestic agenda he
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and set the agenda and
 		yeah well you know the Republicans Republicans have always been weak on on the domestic side they're they're very big on international stuff but domestically they they just say well it'll take care of itself
 	
 	
 		he he worries about
 		true but uh so many of his compi campaign promises were on the the domestic promises
 	
 	
 		but it's
 		yeah
 		well you know same old you know take it with a grain of salt stuff you know he he
 	
 	
 		true
 		that that's that's what just amazes me though is that that so many people do uh take the campaign promises seriously
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and they still do  he
 	
 	
 		well the the one thing that just amazed me in in Texas here there were a series of um ads
 		saying don't vote for Dukakis he's going to take away your right to own a gun he's going to close down defense plants he's going to do this he's going to do that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		half of which is coming true
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i just here's my chance to giggle boy it's a good thing we didn't elect that Dukakis guy because i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know the interesting thing about i don't know if you've been watching Massachusetts lately um
 	
 	
 		i know i know that the the Massachusetts miracle has has gone bust
 	
 	
 		oh it's a disaster it's a disaster and the thing was it was all quick fixes finger in the dike sort of thing to make him look good for the upcoming race
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh i i guess i didn't hear that i didn't go over it really
 	
 	
 		well i mean that that's what you can infer from it because it it's amazing that it started about two years before the the the run
 	
 	
 		true true i suppose
 	
 	
 		and then you know it took a few years to crap out but i mean it was dying last year i lived up in Boston
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i mean it was terrible it was absolutely terrible
 		up prices are just unbelievable up there
 		and the services are getting terrible everything's going down the tubes
 		said he was going to clean up Boston Harbor and it's dirtier than it ever was
 	
 	
 		yeah that really is disappointing it's it's sort of
 	
 	
 		never
 		yeah and then on the other hand too while he was out busy running for the presidential thing the legislature was having their own way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh you know it was just it was a pure disaster because the way it was set up
 		he's the one that that put it together and he's the only one who knew how it worked or supposedly worked
 		and he wasn't there to run it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so here's a bunch of legislatures with their own agenda uh legislators with their own agenda
 		and of course the thing just fell apart fell to pieces and he couldn't do anything with it
 		it was amazing they had a poll last year about i guess it was around July
 		uh
 		they showed the picture of Dukakis
 		to people in Massachusetts only twenty three percent could recognize him as governor
 	
 	
 		that's incredible oh oh there's there's one thing i've got to ask you about the the dump Quayle movement i find that interesting
 	
 	
 		it it was
 		
 
 		i wish they would
 	
 	
 		i i find him such an embarrassment and uh i mean the the the idea of Collin Powell well he's so powerful or he's so popular now
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i i don't know if he's the the right one to replace him he'd probably be a perfectly competent replacement but
 	
 	
 		boy i tell you
 		he i'll tell you what you know when i was in the Air Force i met i met Collin Powell
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah i was i had a pretty neat job i got to meet all the big wigs used to fly with the president and all that stuff
 		um Collin Powell is one capable guy
 	
 	
 		i get i i i would probably find him an order of magnitude more capable than Quayle
 	
 	
 		he
 		oh yes absolutely i i mean the
 	
 	
 		it's it's interesting to hear that Bush has
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		instead instead instead instead of just making bland uh pronouncements about having no plans to change the ticket has just really emphatically come out and said no way
 	
 	
 		i know i and i i'll tell you you know it
 		i i my my degree was in political science because i enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i had a good time during that during that election but it floored me when he came up with Quayle
 		because there are so many other capable Republicans
 	
 	
 		well from from some of the things i've heard about Bush he he he didn't want a vice president that was any competition for him
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		yeah and i mean certainly he wasn't going to take Bob Dole on and not that Bob Dole would even take the position i mean he'd be giving up more than he'd gain
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but there are several people who are who are just super capable
 		but to get this nobody with the kind of baggage that he's carrying
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i uh it just astounded me i mean he must have been so sure of winning that it didn't make any difference
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it uh uh i'm i guess i'm the i'm cloudy on the timing but there there was quite a while when his certain victory wasn't certain at all
 	
 	
 		yeah i well
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm not sure how that timing related to the Quayle announcement but he was trailing at at times
 		or or just just neck and neck i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah i yeah about that time i think it was neck and neck and i the only the only reason at the time that i could think of was that he was young and and sort of charismatic in uh in uh handsome sort of way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and hoping to bring in maybe a little bit of like Kennedy charisma or something
 		but the guy is so uncharismatic
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		i mean Bush talks about he doesn't like broccoli well that's how how i think of Dan Quayle as broccoli you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh that brings up another subject it's the  the the
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know the
