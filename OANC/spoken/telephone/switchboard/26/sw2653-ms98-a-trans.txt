 
     		
 	
 		so i own uh a PCAT at my home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i could never justify owning a personal computer at at home
 		uh i mean that's quite an expense to look
 		for uh well well well who is this what do you do use yours at home for
 	
 	
 		well that's actually a good question my wife works out of the home uh our home she has an office and it sits actually sits in the office and she uses it to compose and print out letters
 	
 	
 		okay well now
 	
 	
 		so that's a a very regular use of it that she has
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then in addition to that i tinker around with it i'm a computer scientist
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i write programs to do little things i'm actually working on a data base at home just just to keep track of things nothing special and also
 		i'm interested in writing some programs that will you know kind of like remind me of things uh like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like
 		although
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well
 		excuse me
 		i uh
 		uh well i'm i'm a technician electronics tech and years ago TI sent me to their uh computer school down in Austin
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh i learned to repair one but you know i never really learned to operate one
 	
 	
 		oh that's a key thing well actually there's that's a there's really two issues to that that there's so many packages software packages available today that just require no programming
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so that you you in other words when someone built that software package they had to use the programming but if they were careful they could uh make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i think you you you really hit the nail on the head for the average person is exactly what he can use it for and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending out letters or if you don't
 		want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage or whatever there your issue is then there really is
 	
 	
 		well uh space is a handicap with me i live in a motor home
 	
 	
 		oh i see wow
 	
 	
 		and i'm preparing for retirement
 	
 	
 		i see well congratulations on that
 	
 	
 		hey i'm not too far from it another year and a half
 	
 	
 		yeah well actually uh one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap that
 	
 	
 		yes definitely the just like the computers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh remember how they started out running three four hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		right oh the calculators you mean
 	
 	
 		now
 		i mean calculators calculators i beg your pardon yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		yeah they sure do
 		yeah i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum you can actually buy a whole a whole brand new computer with a not not a uh necessarily a slow one or or inadequate one but a pretty good one
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		for six hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		you're kidding including a printer
 	
 	
 		no hm that
 		well actually actually i wasn't including a printer but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars so make it seven hundred
 	
 	
 		a hundred
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wholly smoke uh a respectable one
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		well see of not being particularly interested i don't keep track of prices on them but i'm i'm that does amaze amaze me
 	
 	
 		yeah the prices have plummeted you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply the box and the mother board of a a type of computer called an 8088 for about two hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and then the keyboard is another fifty the monitor with the card that drives it is another hundred and then the disk drive is two fifty and
 	
 	
 		well what what is a a a good brand a for inexpensive
 	
 	
 		well that's the that's the deal is you're not buying brands now you're buying these knock offs so there's uh probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one there's there's a magazine called Computer Shopper
 	
 	
 		huh huh
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a big magazine i mean it's it's twelve inches across uh narrow the narrow side and and fifteen fifteen seventeen inches the tall side and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages but the book is the magazine is full
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		of these mail order computer mail order houses and they're all competing with each so you just flip through there until you find a 8088 computer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's that's called that's the original PC so it's be called a TI PC i'm sorry an IBM PC compatible
 		and you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors for forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board board for twenty five dollars which is amazing to me
 		and just you mix and match and then you do it by mail order
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but there's no real brands there's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards the main computer the circuit board
 	
 	
 		i see how do you go about getting one of those uh catalogs
 	
 	
 		they're available in you know the B Daltons that that type of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you'll notice it in that it's it's a it's a very it's although it's a magazine it's large and like i said it's about an inch thick
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well getting back to the PC's i'll tell you i uh first of all i don't like a machine that's smarter than me
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and secondly i learned did learn this much about computers they're they're they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in binary
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		well anyway that's one of my favorite jokes about that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		one and one equals ten
 	
 	
 		yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		course you it's it's kind of an inside joke you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you can only tell that to somebody who understands binary
 	
 	
 		i understand that's great that's a good joke
 	
 	
 		so what do you uh uh work with uh computers uh at TI
 	
 	
 		well what i did for years and then i was was a scientist over in central research labs and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i now i i type that one but i don't use it anymore
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i just recently started using one uh connection with my work
 	
 	
 		i don't
 		um-hum
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh i keep track of an inventory here and of course now that is where a computer is is very handy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes i agree
 	
 	
 		and
 		well
 		i it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh see i'm with the QRA lab
 	
 	
 		oh i see that's fascinating
 	
 	
 		qualification and evaluation so naturally our equipment has to be in in top condition and is constantly calibrated and they're dated
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i have to keep up with them uh and it's very handy doing it on the computer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just run a printout every week and and it puts me right up-to-date what i'm what i have to do what i have to ship what i should be expecting to be returned
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh it it is handy
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i must admit that up until i did start using one uh it was
 		i had very little interest in computers
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but they are amazing
 	
 	
 		yeah they certainly are so let's see so i guess with respect to the question
 		yeah i i guess we've we've kind of covered it
 	
 	
 		well
 		i think we did
 	
 	
 		great nice little conversation with you Jack good good day thank you good same to you
 	
 	
 		yeah Mike you take care now good luck to you
