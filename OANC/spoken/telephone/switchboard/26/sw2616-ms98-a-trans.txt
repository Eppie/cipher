 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so i think i think what we should talk about is the the war um the war that just went on see i don't agree with it first of all i don't believe in war
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then the United States has this attitude by saying you know thank you for
 		keeping us our freedom and stuff like that and i think it's all independent because it's it has nothing to do with the United States you didn't gain anything from it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it wasn't our freedom that you were saving it was just
 		the thing the thing that that uh that i saw was okay Iraq wants to raise oil prices Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system by leaving them independent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so when Iraq you know saw this they said let's take over the country which is a good idea
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		right then the United States says okay our our oil prices are going to go up and like for example see okay like Lithuania Lithuania right they declared themselves uh an independent country with a president right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Russia goes in there well the main government in Moscow goes in there and they kick everybody's ass
 		and the United States doesn't go in there and say listen they were uh you know named an independent you know state with a president and everything but we're not going to go into your country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but these countries here which you know are you know like in nineteen eighty four have you ever read that book
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		okay nineteen eighty four there are like three big continents and uh there's just this area like around Egypt and stuff that everybody's fighting over now the problem is is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		right like their immediate boundaries like you're not going to go you know it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're you're invading their border right but all the other countries you can fight about
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so the thing is is that you're wasting so much money to send you know it's like how much money did the US spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being
 	
 	
 		we'll probably never know how much it actually cost
 	
 	
 		and you know it's it was uh basically all based on oil because nobody actually like for example if uh let's say if uh you know Brazil took over you know Surinam i don't think anybody would care
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yep
 	
 	
 		you know and uh
 		that's something that that has been you know very because see the thing is is like every time that i see a war i see myself on the front line
 		and on the other side i see myself again and i got to shoot myself you know  i got to shoot somebody that's that's got the same family that i do you know the same relationships that i do and just because i was born here i've got to shoot them down
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh it's never a pleasant thing that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh but at least it was it was over quick and there weren't that many deaths  now the only problem is is the aftermath that you're having so many deaths in the border with uh Turkey
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's amazing
 		yes
 		yes that's really unfortunate it really is i don't know if we stopped too soon i don't i don't i really don't know what we need to do about that
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		well
 		there's there's something that that the US did right which is say say you know okay let's kick him out of Kuwait
 		which was our basic goal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh now indirectly let's try to overthrow him
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and they're not going to do that directly
 		but the thing is is that they they didn't go into into Iraq and say you know because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country you know you can seek  seek asylum here and you can go there but no way are you going to rule ever again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		i've been hearing some talk too of trying to bring Hussein up on you know criminal charges i don't know if that will ever happen or not
 	
 	
 		well the thing is is that first of all they got to they got they have to get him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh which is very difficult to do
 	
 	
 		and and there's no way that you can get him unless it's by force
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and then you can put him on trial
 	
 	
 		obviously he's not going to turn himself in
 	
 	
 		no no i think i think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in because there's i mean there's like it's like there's no hope you know like what Hitler did you know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		true
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and so um the thing is is that  once you've done something wrong which is nationally you know internationally recognized
 		then you're going to try to get out of it and the there's no way you know and especially since he's got inside Iraq for using you know chemical weapons and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah true
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know like he sent planes over to to shoot the people down that were on the border with uh that  that were on their way to Turkey
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he had a couple of them bombarded
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah obviously human life means nothing to him
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		but uh
 		you know he's got uh
 		millions of dollars like
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		fifty i think it was like i don't know if it was fifty billion or fifty million which is really doesn't make any difference
 	
 	
 		that's true past a point it doesn't make any difference
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really really unfortunate it really is
 	
 	
 		and
 		but it's just it's just that uh you know it you know like the we just put our goals in different you know levels is like saying you know it's like yeah sure we need oil you know and we need it desperately
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yep
 	
 	
 		but the other countries that you know that have oil but not as big you know like they say you know like when the prices went up and then they went down when they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally though before the before the increase started
 	
 	
 		well the it it's an advantage you know it's like you're saying okay i can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm not going to bring them back down to you know ninety nine cents why because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so if i ten leave it at a dollar ten people are still going to pay
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		you know i went down forty cents but i went up ten cents
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yep
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		about the lowest i've seen gasoline in the Dallas area is uh i guess about ninety two point nine now
 	
 	
 		ninety eight
 	
 	
 		ninety two
 	
 	
 		oh God
 		here it's like it's like a dollar five yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		well there's still a lot of dollar five places around here but you can find some that's under a dollar but not not a whole lot that's the lowest i've seen
 	
 	
 		but still the i mean have you ever checked like uh the most money makers in uh in nin eteen uh ninety
 		uh you can see that uh Exxon and Amaco and uh other companies oh God i forgot their names but uh Exxon was the number one money maker and that was just because of of the last quarter
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right i think Mobil's doing very well too well i assume i assume all the major major brands are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh that was i mean and one of the companies uh went up four hundred and some percent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's practically impossible to do now a days for a company to to shoot up in that way and uh
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just that you know people
 		people take advantage take advantage of that you know like the the companies were saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when you know when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for we've got to raise our prices
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know but still if you realize that uh one barrel has like how much was it like uh
 		forty gallons
 	
 	
 		yeah something like yeah
 	
 	
 		something it's got forty gallons and they're selling you know
 		you you know you you got to pay forty dollars at least and you know for uh for one gallon and it's it was selling like at twenty five or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you're making uh you know fifteen dollars profit easily
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yep sure
 	
 	
 		and uh everything i mean and and the expenses you know of the war you know it's like uh you know it's like who's gaining on this okay because uh i uh does does the US government own any gas companies like like you know like gas stations and stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i because see like for example
 		i don't know if the British government owns Shell i'm not sure about that
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure either
 	
 	
 		but the thing is like the US government got nothing out of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because well you know it's like other the other independent companies the gas stations you know and they did
 		and uh then the taxes go up and then everybody else loses
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um you know they're just
 		they're just some things that might not be worth it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		you know and and uh first of all how many how many people had to had to die before the war  you know it's like transporting stuff and
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		things like that before you know it's like yeah sure you know like to to a couple people that died there their families don't feel it was necessary to do that yeah yeah you you could never you could never bring them back so oh well
 	
 	
 		sure dead's dead
 		that's true
 		well i don't guess we resolved anything but it's interesting it's
 	
 	
 		yeah so okay nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		to you too take care bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
