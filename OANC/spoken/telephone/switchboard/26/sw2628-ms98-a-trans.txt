 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what do you think about it
 	
 	
 		well uh the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i i think a lot of it has to do with women working
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i do too i think it's going to in like in the future i think all women are going to work i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that will be it or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work i mean it it really is coming to that because most women
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah
 	
 	
 		now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them they can't even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like
 	
 	
 		right right
 		and it and it seems if you're going to have kids uh that you are
 		you know  society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh because if you have you know two well if you go to work you're just working to pay for day care two or three you know um
 	
 	
 		right
 		now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		until they got in junior high school my youngest one got in junior high i didn't have to work i mean i didn't work i i needed to but i didn't
 	
 	
 		oh that is good
 		yeah Steve's Steve has a sister who has four she just had her fourth one in uh March and she doesn't have to work either i don't know how they do it
 		i don't i don't know how people do it with one you know um obviously
 	
 	
 		let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you would you know
 	
 	
 		yeah obviously we don't have any and and i don't i think that's part of the role reversal is it's okay to get married
 		and not have kids and i think for society for such a long time said well you know you're married now you need to set have have your family and i don't think it's been until recently that that they had decided that two people was a family
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		right right well it's getting where you can't hardly afford if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two
 	
 	
 		you know and
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i mean it's hard with two now we uh my youngest one i have two i have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon but if i had a third one
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i just don't know where it would come from
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i work now i work full time and uh you know it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that that helps out but still it cost a lot
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i mean just the you know the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		stuff
 	
 	
 		and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous
 	
 	
 		oh i know i know
 	
 	
 		i mean absolutely outrageous and they're getting worse
 		uh my daughter brought home a book the other day
 		that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes and it was like ninety six dollars and this book is a little bitty skinny book i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh but it is it's getting worse and
 	
 	
 		jeez
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if i'd of probably had three or four children i don't see how we could have made it you know without me working
 	
 	
 		but that's that's probably because you know if you had three you you know would say if i'd of had four i guess it's always not not being able to picture one more but in essence you probably would have worked out fine
 	
 	
 		right but i think i would have had to work if i'd of had that many i'd of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i think it's getting more and more like when you have one child now that's it you know then you go to work and you work because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if you have two or three kids by the  way the inflation's going i think a woman's always going to have to work and it's just going to be an accepted thing there isn't going to be any of this you know very few people will ever stay home
 	
 	
 		yeah and and that's all right with me because i don't want to stay home you know i think i'm just part of that the new stuff that is just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long
 	
 	
 		well you know i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time and um well i work all week and um i can't imagine how i stayed home you know i think to myself what did i do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter
 		there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now  to her everything is you've got to go through college you've got to get a job you know and then when everything's set up then you look for
 		somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but i mean it is so far down the road where now when i graduated high school the thing uh-huh and then you got married and then you had a family
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's you did that's what you did
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i mean that's just the way it was you know and uh that's like when my mom i know when my mother's age it was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		always the kids and the family and  everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i uh i i like the way it is it's uh being see we're from Houston and so it's not so hard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for people you know you've been married three or so years and you don't have kids well it's okay not nobody does but you come to a place like Belton
 		and there a lot of the kids here get married out of high school it's real small town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's and a lot of people in our Sunday we're the only couple in our Sunday School class except for one other couple who are in their forties and they can't have children who don't have children and they can't imagine why we would want to have children and i'm going well you know
 		there's more to life you know there's life in there that's you know not everybody has to have kids and i'd rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time here it's your turn you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah but you know that now even whenever i was coming up and everything and
 		we got married right out of high school well a year after i got out of high school and uh i didn't have kids for four and a half years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but that was because i wanted to work and i wasn't ready for kids and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's what it is i'm not either
 		they're probably going oh i bet she can't get pregnant
 	
 	
 		right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when i'd tell them you know well i'm just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now well you don't just get ready
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year and i just was not ready for kids i wanted to get out and work a little bit and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did and uh kids didn't fit in right then but it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples and really
 		if you don't w ant the kids then it's not the time to have it i don't care what anybody tells you and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		because that's like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh even though i'd like to hav e grandchildren i can see her point
 	
 	
 		yeah Steve's mom finally uh
 		finally said you know said that that God will take care of us when it's our time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		she finally admitted you know she finally told me it's okay if you don't but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very very old fashioned family
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she stayed home and raised her kids and and she expected all of her kids to do that too and their wives and to be the the housewife and have dinner ready by five and and you know be there at every beck and call and
 		i was raised totally opposite  how we got together i don't know but because my mother had six girls
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and you know she worked too and i guess i just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i saw how life was when she stayed home and it was rough it was hard  you know
 	
 	
 		yeah and it really is i know it  just like now you know there's
 		there's so much more now all my income goes for things like luxuries i mean it really does except for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff but the rest of it we just buy things like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		boats or we go on trips or you know just
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		the more or less like entertainment stuff but
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you've you've earned that though
 	
 	
 		yeah i feel like i have you know because well we're to the age now i'm not old but i'm older
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do but now i could not go back and do it i really couldn't i don't think i could stay home all the time and do nothing and i mean i did stuff but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		to me it  feels like i must have done nothing and i think it's just the new way that people are thinking
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so i think it would be neat if if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you
 	
 	
 		well you know more and more of them are i don't know if it is up there where you are but where i am the just like all the hospitals they're getting day care but the reason they had to do this was because so many people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		are they
 	
 	
 		you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying
 		all your salary to pay for those two kids to go so uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but it's mainly the hospitals
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i don't know if the TI in Dallas does or not i know i know nobody around here does it we're it's too small around here yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't
 		oh really um
