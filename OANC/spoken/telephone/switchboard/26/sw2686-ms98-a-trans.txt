 
     		
 	
 		so how do you keep abreast of the world's happenings
 	
 	
 		when i'm driving to work i listen to a radio station which is twenty four hour news and that's how i get most of my stuff that gives me about uh
 		thirty minutes thirty five minutes each way each day so that's about an hour and  hour and ten minutes worth of
 	
 	
 		what station's that
 	
 	
 		uh KRLD
 	
 	
 		KRLD i listen to uh ninety point one which is KERA
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh that's the same way i do it i drive about thirty minutes to work twenty minutes actually so listen to that going and coming
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh
 		i don't usually watch the news at night time because uh i'm you know just got home ready for dinner and and all that and by the time i get done with dinner it's already over and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		what a deal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well do you feel like you're kept abreast
 	
 	
 		pretty much yeah because they have the uh CBS uh world news on on the hour on the radio so i get all of that stuff then plus i get all the local news
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well what do you think about the US telling the Iraqis to get out of their camp areas
 	
 	
 		uh what do you think i don't know that's pretty strange
 	
 	
 		it's a it's a different bold move i mean uh with still regardless if we won the war or not it's still uh the country is Iraq
 	
 	
 		yeah you know i mean uh with with like with regard to the Soviet Union we're telling the uh
 		Soviets you know hey the Baltic States wanna separate go ahead and let us separate that'll be good you know what what if the American south wanted to separate like they tried to do in eighteen sixties would we be so forgiving and say ah sure go ahead form your own country
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		you know i mean  seems kind of hypocritical hypocritical of us to to be telling other countries to like go ahead and let part of their country separate off you know and Gorbachev he's the one who wants to keep his country together which i can understand you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the other countries that wanna separate they wanna get away from all that garbage the Soviet Union i don't blame them either
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah it's it's an interesting uh kind of a catch twenty two
 	
 	
 		it's not something
 		that's something that they got to work out for themselves we shouldn't be involved in that we shouldn't even be talking about it you know the government should just stay away from them people and just let them figure out for themselves what they need to do
 	
 	
 		that that is uh
 		that is a bit difficult
 	
 	
 		yeah Bush should not do anything but as as as for the rest of but though i don't you know we get the paper on the weekend
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'll i'll flip through that you know once or twice but not  won't won't read it cover to cover
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		do you read T News at work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's uh i used to read that all the time
 	
 	
 		i do that all everyday so that's another way but that's mainly you know that doesn't have like a whole lot just a few things on there which is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh did you notice what TI stock closed at today i didn't either
 	
 	
 		huh
 		i didn't see it
 	
 	
 		i hear it's forty two though yeah no it well a couple of weeks probably about a week ago it was at forty seven
 	
 	
 		is that right is that up
 		wow
 	
 	
 		but that was uh i believe because of the stockholders' meeting
 	
 	
 		should've sold
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		the building i was in well it guess you work for TI too
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		i guess you work for TI too
 	
 	
 		i did until December
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh that's how come i don't read T News anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah you got surplused i got i got surplused last year myself yeah
 	
 	
 		did you that's that's great  did you just find a a place in another
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		another organization yeah they
 	
 	
 		another TI organization
 	
 	
 		they needed somebody just like me whereas before i was not even doing what i was supposed been doing but uh that's not that's not the topic i guess but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's kind of interesting that they can you know say get out of here in one second and then the other side say come on over here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that worked out pretty well for you i was talking talking to a guy from Colorado Springs yesterday who is
 	
 	
 		it did quite a bit better
 	
 	
 		implied or inferred definitely that he has been surplused from up there and he didn't know what he wanted to do he's been with TI for fifteen years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		so it's uh and he's a nonexempt uh he doesn't know what he's gonna do they're just shutting down the whole plant up there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's gonna be a tough time for all around the country i mean you look at the  look in the paper and you see all the stuff about you know layoffs here layoffs there and you think oh man what's gonna happen
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know thank goodness General Dynamics got that big contract because that'll least bring some money to the area
 	
 	
 		right who who got the contract
 	
 	
 		General Dynamics and Lockheed and Boeing
 	
 	
 		oh well yeah i always get mixed up who's their partners with that late latest deal
 	
 	
 		Lockheed and Boeing on this
 	
 	
 		is it Lockheed and Boeing
 	
 	
 		yeah but Lockheed i used to work for Lockheed and at the time i was there they were developing the prototype for the uh that fighter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so it was pretty big stuff there then now they got the contract for it so
 	
 	
 		so GD didn't get it or is not associated
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they're they're in in partnership with uh Lockheed and and Boeing yeah it's a it's a threesome
 	
 	
 		oh they are okay
 		so it's i thought it was Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas or was that uh Northrop
 	
 	
 		no McDonnell Douglas lost out they lost the contract they were in partnership with Northrop and they lost the contract and so
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah that'll be a biggie i wonder what they do with those planes now that they've made as uh test
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		test plane
 	
 	
 		probably sell to somebody who wants to pay for i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah becomes a new corporate jet
 	
 	
 		yeah there you go old Jerry can use that
 	
 	
 		there you go
 		yeah exactly alrighty well it's been good talking to you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes have a good day bye
 	
 	
 		okay you too bye
