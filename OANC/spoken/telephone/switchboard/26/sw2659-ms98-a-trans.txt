 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		just outside of Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh my mother used to work at the Plano location i think she moved back down into closer into Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so okay let me let me hit one hold on a second here
 	
 	
 		okeydoke well punch one we'll get started
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay i guess my my favorite eating out uh food is Mexican food
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Tex-Mex not real Mexican food
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that real Mexican food is too hot
 	
 	
 		um okay uh my favorite i have a lot of favorites i like to try a lot of different things uh
 		there's very few foods that i don't like i don't like asparagus and beets and anything else i can pretty much eat uh recently i went to a French restaurant and i had something called uh spinach fettucini and crawfish
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and it was so delicious i've been talking about it it's my birthday and i've been talking about it ever ever since it's been about a week now i've been talking about this plate of food and uh the real important part of it for me in a restaurant is the service
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh in this particular French restaurant was our problem to be going back again and again uh they were three waiters that waited on the entire restaurant they just all kept an eye on all the tables
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and something that really impressed me was that i asked one waiter for butter
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and then the next second another a different waiter brought the butter out and and they hadn't even talked or anything and it was it was really amazing  and so that really impresses me the service in a restaurant
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 		yeah well i i like a restaurant i like a restaurant that uh
 		not necessarily for atmosphere you know uh the atmosphere isn't worth a dime if the food is good and the service is lousy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and this little old Mexican restaurant we have right up here from the house i i don't guess it'll hold more than twenty people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's just a little small restaurant  pardon me and it's uh just kind of like a hole in the wall but the food excellent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and the service is just excellent and the price is very reasonable
 	
 	
 		and that's probably not a chain restaurant
 	
 	
 		it's not a chain it's a little a family owned restaurant
 	
 	
 		i find that most most family owned restaurant or or single restaurant you get the best service simply because that restaurant belongs to somebody it it it has the family name on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so whoever's in there is going to take care of you as opposed to going into a chain restaurant where they're just hiring you know people out of that really don't probably don't care too much about the establishment so they're not going to worry about taking care of you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whereas someone that actually is there that owns it that you know has been working there for twenty years or so they want they want you to be happy so you get the service and you know of course with that will come the good food
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah plus you you can go in after you you've
 		you've uh uh gone to the place quite a few times uh they get to know you and uh uh you know appreciate you and say hello to you and how are you doing and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		exactly
 		
 
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and all you got to do is sit down and say we'll have our usual
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know it's just it's real nice and
 	
 	
 		exactly the guy that took me out to this French restaurant he works in a hotel nearby and he just happened to mention to the waiter that he sends a lot of the people from the hotel over to the guy's restaurant
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and at the end of our meal you know we're ready to go and we're full and this guy sends us a platter of each dessert
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that the restaurant has so it was like ten desserts on one plate and he just gave it to us to eat of course we couldn't eat it but you know he just did this and so the next time when we come in he'll probably remember us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just because we looked so weird at the dessert  you know but that that was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		plus you go you go to a big fancy restaurant and uh
 		uh some of the price that you pay for the meal is strictly for the decor and for the atmosphere and you can't eat that
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		one of my favorite restaurants is Steak and Ale now that's a chain sort of a chain restaurant
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they seem to i like i like atmosphere myself and and their food is good and i really like the salad bar and that that gets me in a restaurant if there is really good salad bar because i love salads and soups and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i guess it depends you know if if it's just you and your husband going out to eat uh unless it's uh anniversary or something like that atmosphere doesn't mean that much but if you're taking another couple or taking
 		relatives or friends or something you want the place you know to be nice
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but uh and also we we uh
 	
 	
 		i would
 	
 	
 		i i wasn't too much on Chinese food until i tried it and i really liked it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i even bought me a wok and doing my own doing my own Chinese cooking now but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		did you just recently try it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah we've tried it a couple of time and even had uh uh relatives over and i cooked some out of that and boy they just lapped it up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		all right
 		wow maybe i need to get me a wok and have some people over
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		we saw this one advertised on TV it's uh uh real  real good wok it's hand hand uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		pounded not hand carved hound hand made of iron
 	
 	
 		right right
 		um
 	
 	
 		it's not one of these aluminum or steel woks that you buy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		probably that it heats up real good and uh-huh
 	
 	
 		heats up real good and and the meat and stuff doesn't stick to it like it will uh uh aluminum or uh stainless steel
 	
 	
 		um
 		and that was on a television advertisement one of them nineteen ninety five deals yeah okay
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that sounds good yeah i don't like i've tried probably just about everything just because i don't like to
 	
 	
 		and it uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i don't i hate one thing i hate to do in a restaurant is to be with someone that want try things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i'm also wanting to anything that they have i will try and uh you know sometimes i may not like it but i feel like i miss out you know if i had gone a long time without trying Chinese food i would have had to try it one day just because i hate to miss out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i love i love those fried vegetables
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		especially the uh watercress and the crunchy
 		the crunchy ones
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah the little crunchy things i never know what they are i just call them the crunchers
 	
 	
 		yeah huh yeah we like uh we like seafood too and we found a little ole another little ole hole in the wall that makes excellent fried catfish
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		boy it's good
 	
 	
 		that sounds good i love catfish
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and i love shrimp
 		and
 	
 	
 		we haven't tried any of their seafood and we again had some relatives here last week and we went took them there she had never had catfish she was from Connecticut
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh she had never had channel catfish
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and she tried the scallops i asked her if they were any good because i new the scallops were probably oh you know not local like catfish is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but uh she said they were very good
 	
 	
 		um yeah i don't like scallops too much their they have kind a funny taste i can eat them but they're
 	
 	
 		and she
 		yeah
 		well being from Connecticut they're they're use to fresh seafood like shrimp and lobster and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hum yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm originally from New York i grew up there so i got to eat a lot of uh i mean just fresh fresh i mean one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		one day we were out just driving and they are always uh oriental people with their little stands
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they're selling things and we decided we were going to buy this thing we didn't know what it was we got in the car and opened it up and started eating it and it was really really good and we figured out that it was octopus
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know so we all kind of freaked out but you find all kinds of seafood things in up there where all the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh harbors are and things
 	
 	
 		i never have tried octopus it sounds looks like it would be good because it's all meat there's no bones to it it's not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 		there's not a whole lot of taste it's just basically meat and there's not a lot of taste not a lot to eat not to like you know so unless you think it's bland or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah one of these days i would like to try a rattlesnake too i've heard that it's delicious
 	
 	
 		um ah
 		now that's something i may not try yeah i've heard that's good i've heard frog legs are good i haven't had any of those yet so i'll have to try those one day
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		oh i love frog legs
 		yeah frog frog legs are good of course you know you ask somebody what meat taste like just about any meat you ask them had a it taste like they say like chicken
 	
 	
 		uh-huh exactly
 	
 	
 		but uh it does it's similar to chicken but the meat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the meat is sweeter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and if you've ever i use to go frog gigging as a kid and gigging  the frogs and then uh and get their legs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and the meat is it's crystal clear meat it's beautiful meat
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		now it is a little bits stringy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh because of uh because simply they're frog legs because they you know they have the muscles and so forth
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but it's it's it's sweet meat
 	
 	
 		um i think my favorite meat is lamb
 	
 	
 		now i don't i don't care a whole lot about lamb
 	
 	
 		no i think i think it's it's got i like the texture of it is why i like it not so much the taste but the texture it's not real chewy or
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean it's just real good to me i can't really describe why but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		lamb or veal i'm not real crazy over it
 	
 	
 		yeah i like veal too
 	
 	
 		but uh while i was i i've worked for Texas Instruments out in Ridgecrest California for eight years and one time we went down to uh Bakersfield
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there was a Basque restaurant B A S Q U E
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we stopped there and ate and i wish i could find another one here
 	
 	
 		um i bet
 	
 	
 		oh it was good they serve it family style everything in
