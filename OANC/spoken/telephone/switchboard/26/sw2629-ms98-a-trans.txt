 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what i was doing at at home in fact i work at nights here so that's another long story we'll talk about
 		it's funny that i got you though
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i asked my wife to hand me the other phone because i was just i was busy and uh i had just gotten a call and i couldn't answer it and i said well i'll punch it on this one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's a walk around phone but it's not a uh it's not the other kind you know
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what mine is
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it didn't work
 	
 	
 		now i've got a portable cordless is that what you're using
 	
 	
 		okay
 		no i'm using a regular phone now uh
 	
 	
 		okay i got a i i'm using a cordless
 	
 	
 		if if it's a what kind of phone do they talk it's not a dial but if it's a touchtone it's okay
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		i realized that once i used i should have i was going to go in the kitchen and and punch one on the touchtone
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i realized that i had screwed it up so it was my fault
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		that's funny that we had gotten it
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		uh  i guess they want us to talk about dogs but dogs or cats
 	
 	
 		dogs and cats
 		that your cat your Rex
 	
 	
 		i'll switch over to birds you know we we don't really have birds as pets but we sure because we have cats
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we always wind up with i haven't yet uh
 		a bird or two in the Summer because the cat will catch one and usually we'll catch the cat because the cat doesn't seem to kill the bird right away
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we wound up with a lot of birds over the years and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		there are organizations we drop ours off at Fort Worth if they're still alive and you keep it alive which is hard to do for a couple of weeks
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if you take it to an agency they'll send it back in the wild somehow and so we we wound up because of our cats with with many birds over the years uh again they're not pets exactly but uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		this guy at work that i work with uh raises birds uh he has a
 		a macaw macaw macaw
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and parakeets and something else he one of those macaw parrots
 	
 	
 		the lady next door across from across the street from us just lost
 		is it a cockatoo what's that one that's white
 	
 	
 		yeah a cockatoo i think it's a cockatoo
 	
 	
 		it got loose and i've forgotten what how she did it and she had it in a cage of some sort
 	
 	
 		did it really
 	
 	
 		and what they were doing i don't know but it flew away you know and they called it and everything and rode drove around the neighborhood looking for it but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		those are expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah it's free yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'm surprised that a bird uh i guess they can find their way back but i wonder exactly where a tame bird would go
 	
 	
 		did she ever get it back
 	
 	
 		no no she never got it back i've heard stories like this before with parrots and all this uh because people let them out out in their house you know and fly around
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 		uh-huh
 		yeah my daughter had one i wouldn't have one flying around my house
 	
 	
 		and
 		no i know uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh i've forgotten she had it outside somehow and somehow they they mixed signals or something and uh it got loose of course again again the animals are so much faster than we are in one way or the other
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		boy that's a shame
 	
 	
 		uh you know i was telling you the story about fencing i do like dogs i i would i've always had dogs my whole life as a kid
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		don't you miss them now i mean
 	
 	
 		well yeah i do i
 	
 	
 		because they're they have such personalities
 	
 	
 		yeah i do i think that all the animals have personality i'm not the cat person i my sister had cats when we were little
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we always seem to have a cat and a dog together which again when you bring them up i do notice that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they get along
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and my wife was the cat lover and when when we started out as a young young married couple we just had an apartment so you it's kind of easier to have a cat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and then she just never wanted a dog and then we got here to Texas uh she's from Texas again and uh
 		she she had this thing with the fence and i i guess i have so many
 		interests i don't really quite have the time with with two daughters and everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		and all the activities to personally train a dog but i would i would i guess i'll have to wait until both of my kids are out of college before i get another dog again i guess i'm
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		i i i certainly saw your point with the Greyhound that there's there is a limit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh to a pet um
 	
 	
 		yeah you know you think you're you think that's what you want and i really gave it a good try
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i had her spoiled i mean she was spoiled rotten but she was so
 		and i have a new house and i and
 		to walk in my house i'd have especially uh especially on a rainy day i'd have to take a bucket of water out there and wash all four of her feet
 		this is a fifty pound dog i'm going to pick up a leg at a time and wash and set it down on something clean while i got the other three you know and and then i'd let her in the house well still even putting her feet in the bucket of water and wash them real good
 		she still would come in so fast and so heavy that she'd dig her paws deep down into my carpet you know and just take out running to and she would
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh she was ruining my carpet and i thought gosh i i love my new house more than i love her i think you know i just really have a big investment and i don't i just
 		it was just more work than it was really really i wasn't enjoying her that's what it was maybe if i'd a had a run for a dog run but i think that's cruel to put a dog in a run
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah no i think so too uh my wife just she keeps convincing me because my my parents uh my parents are dead now but my parents and my brothers and sisters always had dogs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when we would visit them she said you can smell dog over the house i said well you're really right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so i never she always had a good argument why not to get a dog and we haven't since we've been married
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but now see i have always felt that i could always smell cats
 		cats to me always i i i used to have some friends' house that i couldn't stand to go in their house i could smell their their litter box i thought oh my God i couldn't stand it and i don't know how they stood it i guess they didn't smell it
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah yeah
 		uh no yeah i think you're right uh people are surprisingly are allergic to cats too we do have some friends on and off that will
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		i guess it's the hair the cat the short fur on the cat is uh one of the allergic reaction things like uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		cedar trees and all of the other stuff i guess the cat has a real fine not the that the real short hair dandruff or whatever they have that people do get allergic to cats uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in their eyes you know they just walk in the house even though we lock up the cats and they're crying
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and so some people unfortunately of course i wouldn't have an animal if i was allergic to it either
 	
 	
 		well i wouldn't either
 	
 	
 		uh my wife at one time said she was allergic to them uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i was going to say a story
 	
 	
 		well i know is there're supposed to be is it Chihuahuas they're supposed to be good for asthma they say Chihuahua dogs are supposed to be good for people with asthma i always heard
 	
 	
 		well i think the animal's good for you just because uh it gets you out and everything i uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and don't i think they're using you know they're using animals in old folks home now and make and some hospitals because it's supposed to make people
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		brings your blood pressure down you know dogs are always so happy to see you come home you know they always are just wagging i don't care how grumpy you are or what dogs are glad to see you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		cats are kind of independent like  get in they're they let you live with them you know  so independent
 	
 	
 		right
 		i have some friends uh uh that have horses you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when my daughters were a little younger you know i thought well maybe that's a good maybe i'll get them uh you know this is Texas and i'll get them a horse
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well we went over and we rode their horses and everything but and and just listened to the stories and the money
 		the horse was sick all the time
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you i don't know if you if you have any friends with horses but they get all kinds of eating disorders if they don't if they don't eat the right grain or if you
 	
 	
 		oh
 		see i was thinking about buying a horse maybe i don't want
 	
 	
 		if you give him an orange or something you nearly kill it i mean it the the stories he would tell it must have cost him a couple hundred dollars a month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		just to feed
 	
 	
 		of course he had several horses for shots and different things i thought my God and i just saw something interesting Consumer Reports they talked they had a animals and they compared
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know whether you should have a bird and and the pricing and it had a comment around a horse something to the effect of
 		you don't even want to know what it cost to keep a horse you know  and i
 	
 	
 		cost  yeah
 		i think i'll just go rent a horse if i want to ride one
 	
 	
 		right i think the best thing in the world is to rent them i think that uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		that that and boats are probably the same way i'd love to have a boat too but i think uh i'm not too sure i i would get that much use out of it you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i mean well i do enjoy my dog uh she's such a
 		oh she's my best friend and when when i lived in Orlando she uh got paralyzed from her waist down and uh waist
 	
 	
 		my goodness from what
 	
 	
 		and i thought it was uh
 		uh we almost had to put her to sleep and i just cried for two days but i think what i i i ironically what happened was she got had fleas
 		and i think it was the stuff i was having putting on her that that paralyzed her but
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		the fleas i think's what brought her back is she had to scratch so bad that she started using her paralyzed the the doctor was just amazed at a that she came back because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he really was going to was going to do surgery for fifteen hundred dollars or put her to sleep and i was going to have to opt to have to put her to sleep even as much much as i loved her i wasn't going to spend fifteen hundred dollars on an experiment
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah plus i'm not too sure yeah i think they are experiments too and they don't know that much uh
 	
 	
 		no but it was just uh that spot that they put on the back of a dog uh they used to use it on cattle and uh so i started using it on her and i'd take to her to the vet once a month and get that spot put on her
 	
 	
 		my sister spent a lot of go ahead
 	
 	
 		and she wouldn't have any fleas never had any fleas hadn't never any then all of a sudden uh i took her
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i was living in Orlando and i put i put her in the vet for while i came home to Dallas for a while and i took and when i picked her up she had fleas again
 		and so my daughter came down and visited me me from Dallas and and while she was there the dog got paralyzed
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and so i took her back up to the doctor and
 		anyway he he said it wasn't that but
 		another doctor told me that there had been uh people the pet owners had been getting permanently paralyzed from petting the dogs that had that spot on them
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		so i thought well and so i can't find a vet that'll do that for me anymore put the spot on her anymore and i don't want it anymore anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i do fight fleas oh gosh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they're they're a problem the the different rainy seasons here i don't how long you been here in in the area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh i moved back in eighty eight the December of eighty eight
 	
 	
 		oh course you were here before
 	
 	
 		yeah i lived here before i'd worked for TI for seventeen years and then i moved to Orlando uh with Mark and Marietta
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and let let me talk about fleas we have nothing compared to fleas down they have down there
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and they have them year round at least they die out kind of in the wintertime here in the yard down there they don't they're are just and they are big suckers i mean big
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and they are just almost impossible to get rid of it costs a fortune if you have a pet you're going to have fleas down there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i just had my house treated and treated and treated and treated and did i did all the things you're supposed to and i couldn't get rid of
