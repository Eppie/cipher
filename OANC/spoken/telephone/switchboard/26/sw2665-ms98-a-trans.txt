 
     		
 	
 		okay the recording started what kind of habits hobbies do you have
 	
 	
 		okay
 		i have two main hobbies one of them is painting and the other one is collecting wine but from your from the description it sounds like they're more interested in painting
 	
 	
 		oh  well i'm interested in wine i like the wine
 	
 	
 		oh that's good that's fine i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah what kind of wines do you like
 	
 	
 		well i'm a very big favor uh much in favor of red wines and i have about a thousand bottles down in my cellar and i've been collecting it now for oh fifteen years or so
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		my goodness red wines huh i'm a white wine drinker myself i i'm on the white Zinfandels now i i've come up the ladder the Chablis and the Rhines now i'm got uh on uh Zinfandels
 	
 	
 		oh okay see white Zinfandels are not a big favorite of mine though
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		the whites i like are these very okay Chardonnays like Kessler Kessler and things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		you don't have any vineyards up there do you Meryl
 	
 	
 		uh there are some but and in fact their white wines are better than their red wines because they don't get enough sun to make good red wine
 	
 	
 		are there
 		oh okay now see i'm from Grapevine that's uh used to be we have a winery here but uh it used to be uh
 		i think they had a couple of wineries at one time but they do grow grapes here that's where they get the name Grapevine
 	
 	
 		i'm originally from El Paso Texas and i have friend who has a vineyard actually it's in New Mexico near La Yunon New Mexico which is just north of El Paso up the valley
 	
 	
 		oh are you
 		uh-huh i understand i understand the University of Texas has a huge winery down in south Texas some place really big one
 		but i don't know they're
 		i guess they're bottling it i don't what they sell it under what name they sell it under have you ever visited the wineries in California
 	
 	
 		yes some of them
 	
 	
 		i uh i've uh gone to a couple my parents live in northern California so i visit there but back to hobbies i guess uh
 		and what what kind of painting do you do
 	
 	
 		oh mostly mostly figures i've few done landscapes my grandmother was an artist so when i was a little kid
 		i was baby sat in her studio so i learned to mix paint by watching people mix paint things like that so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh okay that's a good idea i used to paint uh you know i just dabble and i really think i have a talent for it but i've never really
 		explored it like i should what little i have done i think is pretty good but as i said i never have gone on with it maybe i should have
 		if i'd uh you know taken a lessons or something but  i in through the years i've just i'm not any good any more when i was younger i i used to be pretty good
 	
 	
 		oh for for years i used to go to groups that hire a model and draw once a week when i lived in New Jersey and used to work at Bell Labs and
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'd go twice a week for three hours and you do that for about ten years you get to where you can actually draw pretty well
 	
 	
 		yes i would imagine i would hope so anyway  well i  when i was in high school i think i drew a mural behind the concession stand at the local theatre and you know stuff like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i won first  prize painting the front of a bar Halloween night instead of kids soaping windows they wanted us to paint you know windows in town and i painted something won first prize on that but like i said i never did go on with it and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i still paint occasionally not as much as i used to but i still paint i have some stuff set up the only two things in my basement are my painting stuff and the wine cellar which is
 	
 	
 		wine we have wine cellars that's nice let me
 	
 	
 		well i built it i you you have to way have some way of storing them so
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 		oh uh-huh well you know we don't have not many people have basements here for some reason i don't know why the the ground's
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		not wet like it is in Florida so i don't why they don't have basements you don't see too many of them
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you probably don't get very good
 		very good number of square feet for your dollar building a basement there that's probably why
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so guess so well i  only hobbies i have is i jog and uh every night
 		and
 		that's just that and my yard work i love to i work in the yard i i have my yard work done but i do my flowers you know and stuff i i like to do stuff like that and i have quite a variety of flowers
 		i work on that every all the time
 	
 	
 		so you must have a lot well you ought to be seeing lots of flowers this time of year
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they really are beautiful gorgeous time of the year because uh they're really out and especially roses roses do grow good down here
 		i guess that's probably my best hobby and then i do volunteer work at a hospital that's kind of a hobby i guess i work in intensive care at a local hospital
 		just  um one night a week
 		and that's kind of fun and different and kind of like a hobby i guess
 	
 	
 		you find out what it's like in that kind of business
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i'm amazed the people uh the different types of people i've met that the rude people the people that are so inconsiderate of other people and i it just boggles my mind how many i find like that that
 		think they're the only ones that are grieving or having a hard time they don't have any respect for the people you know sitting across the room you know and they'll be laughing and carrying on and here are these people that are
 		sad and i just  i just can't get over people how people are i'm really getting getting a rude awakening to how the human nature is i guess
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and last last night i just there's big signs telling them not to go in without checking with the
 		volunteer and you must be twelve years of age to go in and no more than two people at a time and so this man walks in
 		you know just walks up without even checking with me with his seven year old daughter and his wife so that's three of them just you know there's three rules right there he busted you know just walked right on in and i thought
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		golly you know he didn't even follow any of the rules and i
 		and didn't even seem to bother of course they kicked him right out
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		and he probably didn't like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah very highly insulted you know how dare they  but i just
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		can't i just can't believe people i it this is the that's some place you need to work to really see how people really are  when it comes right down to it anyway
 	
 	
 		well working in a research place where i work at National Institute of Standards and Technology which used to be National Bureau of Standards that's kind of an ivory tower place so
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah
 		i know used to know a guy that uh from TI that was uh real big in standards uh James Tu that worked at uh TI and he was
 		uh over the standards labs and everything i believe there
 		and i was always impressed by all the clocks and you know the when we take things to be calibrated and what have you in the standards lab and it was kind of interesting
 		that what you all do calibrate and
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		yeah there's lots of stuff the only people i guess i know at TI are either the people who work in the speech program who run this this computer program or if the people in the semiconductor area i used to know Pallab Chatterjee and those kind of people i don't know don't know if you'd know him or not
 	
 	
 		huh
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		no i had worked for TI for seventeen years but i uh
 		quit about five years six years ago i guess and went with Mark Marietta and then came up here with another company and uh about two and a half years ago from Florida
 		they're just back in the same area but i enjoy it here i'm a Texas person i'm not a native Texan but i love Texas so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i wasn't happy till i got back
 	
 	
 		well i grew up in Texas and i moved away and never came back so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		never came back huh oh well  my all my family's in California i just i don't know i just couldn't stand being away from Texas i kept coming back
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it feels good i i'm real happy here i like the weather and the people and i like the people in Florida too they were nice uh i enjoyed Florida but i like Texas better i guess but
