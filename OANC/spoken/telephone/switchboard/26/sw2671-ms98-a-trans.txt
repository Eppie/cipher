 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		there we go
 	
 	
 		okay music
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 		i like um a lot of different things so um i'm into got a big record collection and uh uh mostly mostly rock but i got some folk and some jazz
 	
 	
 		yeah so do i
 		i have everything from Frank Sinatra to the Sex Pistols
 	
 	
 		yeah okay that's uh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that that covers a pretty wide range right there
 	
 	
 		it's a pretty weird thing i was pretty bummed when they had CD's come out though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hum well yeah i mean you can get CD's of the Sex Pistols which um i think kind of defeats i mean somebody's missing the point
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		well i've got four hundred and fifty records  and it's like oh
 	
 	
 		well i have um
 		i know i don't know what the exact count is but i know it's like eight hundred to nine hundred
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		albums and um
 		yeah i i got a CD player about four or five years ago and i've been buying CD's but um you know i'm not trying to
 		i'm not trying to go LP to CD because well for a couple of reasons one is i can't afford it  and  um the other is some of the stuff that um i've got a and i'll never find on CD it'll never be reissued
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah no
 	
 	
 		and and and there's a bunch of stuff that i really really don't care if i have it on CD
 	
 	
 		right right i've got a pretty good David Bowie collection
 	
 	
 		oh you're you're a big Bowie fan or
 	
 	
 		uh yeah used to be i mean i i still like him a lot but he's
 		he's gotten so kind of weird i mean in that he was truly weird before and now he's just kind of middle of the road
 	
 	
 		yeah i was just kind of well  styles change and you get it's like oh Dave Bowie's not weird anymore i'll get uh
 	
 	
 		right oh he he
 		yeah he's marrying that model and  i don't know that Iman the black model she's about twenty two years old
 	
 	
 		he married a model i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		i think they're supposed to get married i know he's been everywhere with her
 	
 	
 		hum i haven't been
 		i been uh i got to pay attention hum
 	
 	
 		staying up with People magazine  you haven't been staying up with People magazine
 	
 	
 		no man you know just got the new issue of Rolling Stone and they didn't mention it so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh every so often he's on the society
 		society page as it were with a picture of her
 	
 	
 		it seems so odd to me that David Bowie is showing up in People magazine it's just like wait a minute  i mean you know it's like oh
 	
 	
 		it yeah it's wrong
 	
 	
 		okay you know New Kids On the Block all right these are you know these aren't serious people anyway but Bowie
 	
 	
 		right right yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i'm not i'm not a huge Bowie fan but i like his music actually the the coolest Bowie thing that one one one one of the coolest things i have happens to be a Bowie item it's a um
 		um
 		it's a picture disk with uh of him and Bing Crosby doing Peace on Earth uh Little Drummer Boy and you know you can get this as a forty five but this is like a twelve inch with um the um the label is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		instead of being a real label is a picture of him and Bing from the uh from the Christmas special that it was from
 	
 	
 		how funny
 	
 	
 		it's it's a trip um
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah you can get uh you know if you can get actually buy the forty five it's usually out around Christmas time because it's it's it's a really neat song actually and they do they do a good duet
 		um but it's it's always the thing that's like oh you know you know when i got people over and we're trying to you know you know uh you know weirding people out on music that one usually gets them
 	
 	
 		one up yeah
 		um i got i've got like bootlegs of his concerts and stuff which i kind of treasure and
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		his old records and stuff and i remember when i was in high school you combing record stores anytime i could get the chance uh for something of his and now it all seems for not you know you can get his old stuff on CD
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah uh
 	
 	
 		it's like what were all those hours those little treasures i have but i have originals you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i know the feeling when i've gone um and just knocked myself out um i'm a big Who fan
 	
 	
 		that's
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i've gone and knocked myself out sometimes finding old Who forty fives with like these B sides that never got put on an album you know and i was knocking myself you know i found these a bunch of them you know didn't spend a whole lot of money on them um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right but uh finding them was the  the effort
 	
 	
 		yeah i've yeah it was a big thing well i got i have a friend who's like the forty five king of the world he has
 		something along the lines of fifteen thousand forty fives he has every top forty single
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		since he was born nineteen you know like nineteen sixty four and i think every top twenty single going back to around fifty five i think he's cut it out lately because most most of the stuff
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		you know he can only get as cassette single and he you know we both despise cassette singles um but he's found some of the Who stuff for me and you know we went you know all all this trouble to find this and then
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they released a couple Who rarity albums that had like half the stuff on it it's like great
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know and then the one other i think the one other Who thing he located for me was um
 		uh i don't know if you're familiar with the Who they they have a song called Substitute
 		doesn't ring a bell
 	
 	
 		it sounds familiar but i can't no i like the Who i've got some Who
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		okay anyway um there was a
 		um a single of Substitute out and
 	
 	
 		Substitute yeah Substitute yeah i know that song yeah okay yeah
 	
 	
 		okay now you know what i'm talking about yeah um anyway it came out in the mid sixties in in this country on a weird record on a record label that they aren't normally on so it was cool they find it for that but the B side was something called Waltz for a Pig which
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		wasn't on any record and it wasn't on the rarity records so this was a big deal and then um you know once once Steve found it for me and everything i i happened to go and and look back at some like Who biographies i have and uh i discovered that
 		the B side isn't actually by the Who it's b y what's called the Who Orchestra because there was some like legal thing that said the Who couldn't record and so it was actually by the by a band called the Grand Bond Organization
 		so it's like gee all this trouble and it's not even the Who oh well it's a fun thing to have anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah something
 		how funny yeah it's
 	
 	
 		but it turns out that um
 		uh you know listening to the the version of Substitute on the single it's actually different than
 		than um the one that was normally in the US because um
 		uh there was some lyrics they found objectionable i think the one uh i look all white but my dad was black
 		um the American record companies said nah  you know you can't release this so they it has a different lyric on it so that's kind of neat
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's worth it i guess for the for the people that really like it
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah
 		well yeah um you know i have um you know like you were saying you know i've got i have a lot a lot of bootlegs and stuff by the Who and uh by Pete Townsend and uh some of the really fun stuff with Townsend is um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		one one of the demos i have is called Obscure and Oblique and it's it's a bunch of demos
 		and i  you know i'm really curious actually how they got their hands on this stuff but um it's really cool listening to the stuff because um you hear things that are different than the way the Who actually recorded the song or or he recorded the song solo
 	
 	
 		cool yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's just kind of interesting to see his um you know
 	
 	
 		how he works up to the final product
 	
 	
 		yeah there's um he's also put out a couple albums called Scoop Scoop and Another Scoop which um are collections of demos so i have like three collections of demos of his and there's a couple songs in the collections that are
 		the same almost the same as songs the Who did on their last album but aren't
 		so that's that's really cool i mean there's this one song called Popular that became the song It's Hard with um a different verse
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		how fun oh that's great oh you do fifteen thousand singles oh i can't i have like uh
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		twenty five and i think i'm doing real well but a lot of those are real precious to me you know like Vanilla Cherry Vanilla you know the which was a i i have all of these like uh
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the Bowie genealogy you know if if if i read somewhere in you know Circus magazine in nineteen seventy two that David Bowie knew so and so well  i had this get you know i bought a Mot the Hoople album i didn't even know who Mot the Hoople was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		oh but you got a good one though
 	
 	
 		but i knew that David Bowie produced it right so if David Bowie wrote a song and somebody did it i ran bought i bought the album you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm like that a lot with the Who i've got
 		i i counted it up sometime and i have like twelve versions of Pinball Wizard by you know either by the Who or it's a demo or it's a live version by the Who and then there's like the Elton John version and then um
 	
 	
 		wow
 		right
 	
 	
 		i guess the the the weirdest ones i have are ones by the New Seekers you know the guys that did I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing and uh the other one is uh Rod Stewart of all people Rod
 	
 	
 		yeah you know
 		you know i was listening to that song the other day now you you
 		you would know this you of all people would know this i was like i have listened to that song a million times okay and we had just gone to church and then we were like listening to it and i went
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know this is a really Christian song Harry to my husband and he was like no i think it's you're just weird but have you ever i mean i i know that's kind of a strange thing to say but
 		uh do you see like those those overtones i mean couldn't that be like a gospel song  you're going to go listen to it and go this girl's really weird  but i mean it's like
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's it's hard for me to listen listen to it in true light anymore since i've heard it so many times um i mean i can't i mean i want to throw up usually when i hear it anymore i um
 	
 	
 		i
 		
  
 		but i was listening to it and it was like you know the guy was like blind i don't i can't even uh think of what now and i kept saying no no you know listen it it works
 	
 	
 		well the the problem with the problem with Pinball Wizard is that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's you you hear it on the radio and it's completely out of context with
 		because it it it's part of a larger work
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um so i don't know i mean i don't i don't want to disagree with you i i
 	
 	
 		i i don't know how many
