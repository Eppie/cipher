 
     		
 	
 		okay so um
 		seeing we're both from different parts of the country um i imagine that uh
 		social changes have happened in both areas but you know is rapid i'm not sure could you tell me some of the things that's happened in your area
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i thought the second part of the question you know how do you perceive life in the United States differently
 		you know as opposed to ten to fifteen years ago um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know that one  my oldest children are
 		are fifteen
 		so
 		that's huh you know that that was immediately what clicked in my head what do i see now
 		different than i do you know when they were born
 	
 	
 		when they were born yeah
 	
 	
 		you know um i have my oldest are two girls they are fifteen and fourteen
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		so not quite fourteen the um
 		i think we're seeing lots and lots of  of changes as regarding families you know at that point i felt like i was one of the few people that truly wanted to children
 		and now i think you're seeing that a little bit more it's coming back again
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but people are certainly having their children their families later
 		you know it's not
 	
 	
 		uh yeah in some cases uh
 	
 	
 		and the ones that are having them earlier they're having them a lot earlier  like eleven  or ten
 	
 	
 		that's yeah that's early uh i was kind of young i i got married as soon as i got out of school and started raising a family so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh my oldest is uh thirty four
 		and my youngest is going to be twenty six
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so that uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		definitely makes a difference my husband was quite a bit older when we married and
 		we decided to you know we wanted to
 		to get our family pretty quick you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah right yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		that was you know really a definitely uh identifying factor you know we began
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i i'm not sure about that  excuse me
 	
 	
 		in having a
 		well i know that uh here in Dallas we have the unfortunate um
 		reputation as being i think it's the fifth
 		largest of uh i'm trying to think how that was fifth on the list
 		of teenage mothers in the United States
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		oh yeah we have i think in nineteen it seems like the statistic was for nineteen eighty eight
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in Dallas County there were
 	
 	
 		yeah the problem yeah
 	
 	
 		i want to say three hundred and fifteen gosh that seems like an awful lot
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		of children born to mothers under the age of thirteen
 	
 	
 		oh yeah but  under thirteen probably what do you contribute that to then as compared to say uh uh twenty years ago
 		you know with with children
 	
 	
 		it can't be education because you know there's more and more family related issues being raised at school
 		um
 		you know they're lot more progressive more pointed sex education programs all over the country
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		right right i grew up in kind of uh there was a rural area and there was nothing but farms and
 		mostly mostly dairy and orchards apple orchards and you know peach orchards uh
 	
 	
 		one thing that i really see a difference and i guess you know overall uh you know that it's a negative
 		is that
 		you know these kids and we live in suburban a suburban area
 		of Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		these kids do not have the aunts and uncles
 		the cousins
 		you know that built-in kind of security
 		you know
 	
 	
 		why because we're a more mobile society
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		uh people are just moving out getting jobs and our families on
 	
 	
 		you know of course you have lots and lots of moms working
 	
 	
 		that's that's a big problem because at least i i see that up here when when i was growing up and going to school uh people never locked their doors and uh you know you had family that was
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		generally in the area most people kind of stayed put you know very few moved away
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so there's kind of a nucleus of cohesion there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that you could rely on you know if you were ready to just
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i think the whole country back then was naive
 	
 	
 		strangle your parents you kind of had
 		course there's just a different uh just different feeling as to who who's in control i don't think we ever talked about children's rights
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know we didn't talk about women's rights  you know we sure didn't talk about kids' rights
 	
 	
 		yeah right and and
 		right children have children have responsibility but i think the the biggest thing now is that uh information is is passed on a lot quicker with with TV and radio and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh children are under a lot more pressure because from their peers than than it used to be
 	
 	
 		well you know i can remember as a teenager
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know we would
 		get things fashion wise you know we always consider considered Dallas the third coast you know i mean you know feel very uh um
 	
 	
 		yes right yeah
 	
 	
 		always felt like we were on the edge of of new trends and you know i had a lot of uh friends and in
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		Wyoming and Utah and Colorado because that's where my parents were from
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and we would go there they were always seeing movies that had been here six months before and they were wearing clothes and saying lingo using new lingo that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we heard way before and so we always felt you know a little you know kind of thumb your nose and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but now that's not so you know if those those those parts of the country aren't behind you know they're getting the movies if not you know
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		right at the same time they're getting them you know six weeks later it's not you know not so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		and yet i think i think we're really evolving right now i
 		you know the seventies and eighties were so uh get all you can cause you may not be here tomorrow and money hungry  i think we're seeing some comeback to family um
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i
 		yeah it's uh
 		a family unit yes um
 		but you can't trust anybody anymore
 	
 	
 		it's it's a different family unit though
 	
 	
 		yes it is
 	
 	
 		you know it's not the same that we  traditionally thought of
 	
 	
 		no it it goes back i guess way way back  peo ple had a lot of children and they and they they were kind of uh they most of them were on farms i guess or they worked in factories
 		at least in the east you know my father my grandfather and his father before him always worked at this place so then i would work at this place
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um out in the rural areas we were always farmers or was always going to be farmers
 		so you had a lot of children they kind of money didn't seem to be important back then
 	
 	
 		when we uh moved to this particular town this a suburb of Dallas ten years ago there was still a lot
 		lot of agriculture of of land that was used for agricultural purposes and that is just you know every year just a little bit more a little bit more slips away
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 		yeah but with a uh  excuse me with a uh
 		run by families or or were the younger children going out into the world and then they were bringing in
 	
 	
 		i don't know um
 	
 	
 		you know labor is to to take care of the crops
 	
 	
 		i think probably main a lot of it was you know contract labor um
 	
 	
 		because the kids wanted something more i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah the kids want something more there's a great deal of respect in this area for agriculture and for the foundation that it has given this particular community
 		and we still have a couple of very viable families who are you know make large contributions time money you know emotionally to the community and preservation preservation of its heritage but we don't uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know but but even their concerns are becoming more diversified
 	
 	
 		yeah i i your
 	
 	
 		but you know one thing that and this is just totally off the wall but it's another uh another element as we see the encroachment of
 		of progress on
 		just the ecosystem ecosystem when we moved here and the the fields were mowed every summer we would have this massive influx of crickets
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		from the fields into our homes you know just  i mean crickets so thick you couldn't walk without stepping on them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and course that then brought different birds that didn't normally come to our area and i don't know what all other effects on the ecosystem because that's not my bailiwick but see we don't have that anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you wonder what other little
 	
 	
 		man's changed it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i was reading in uh
 		i think it was the Reader's Digest just earlier in the week about
