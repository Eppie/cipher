 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay uh the question was about uh physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise well uh i i don't do it as much as i should i try to walk
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh last year i would i did it every day but i've kind of in ninety one i've kind of gone down hill
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so i'm not doing it as much as i need to but i i can tell you when i do do it on a regular basis i feel so much better and so much healthier
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		but it's just to get motivated to do it and once i get started and and i i i can i do it every night it's just to get uh motivated motivated again and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what happened about couple of weeks ago i started again and um
 		i was walking and it got kind of dark and i was by myself and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and so i i kind of got frightened and i kind of use that as an excuse All i have to do is start earlier  but i haven't walked since so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		it's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it sure is it sure is it sure is how about you do you exercise on a regular basis
 	
 	
 		um well i try to um i started at the beginning of this year i decided all right i'm going to start exercising again i'm going to be real good and i went through the TI fitness center and registered for the uh aerobics classes there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they run for two months at a time and you have to you do have to pay to take them and i took i signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half so that was four and a half hours a week
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it cost sixty dollars and i thought okay that's not cheap that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money and i had a friend of mine going so i was real good i only missed it about three times
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then oh March came around and i signed up again and i got uh caught up with a class i was taking at TI and then i was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after i got out of class and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then i went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the TI up there and so that was two weeks i had missed and boy i tell you what i've been terrible ever since then
 	
 	
 		yeah it's once you get out of that habit you just don't you don't get back into it because i teach school and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class we went in together and hired a private instructor and she came to our school twice a week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i i was i would go faithfully and then i missed once then i went back again a couple times and missed another time and then kept missing and never went back again i think if you you just have to stick with it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah i think i've been two maybe three times the month of April and this session is about to run out now i signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because i am getting kind of
 		into a real a busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes and some of them require me to go out of town and and uh that just kind of throws my whole schedule off when am doing that so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i've lately yeah there's been nights that i could have gone and i've found excuses uh  things like i i had the flu last week but i'm fine this week i could have gone Monday i could have gone tonight and i didn't so i'm kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of finding excuses and now it's kind of like well this is the last week i'll just start fresh next week but i better do better do it and i think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months
 		wasn't the second two months she started taking tennis lessons and so i haven't had that extra motivation of of us forcing each other or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure yeah that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing like it's misery loves company i don't really love exercise i mean some i the neighbor across the street she goes belongs to President's and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it's not President's any more i don't know what the name of it is anymore but uh she loves it i mean she it's just it's an automatic high for her she just enjoys it so much and i don't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah i'm the same way
 	
 	
 		i'm i feel good after i do it but i hate it when i'm doing it you know i just i don't enjoy it at all and she just loves it so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it even when she doesn't go to the health club she runs you know and it's a daily thing for her so it you know and it's so hard for me i envy her i wish i could be that way but i don't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		i do too
 	
 	
 		i don't and i have an older sister that loves running too and she runs all the time
 		but at to me it's every minute's agony and i in fact i don't run i hate to run like when i walk i'll take along a radio or something and that helps you know pass the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right yeah walking is kind of boring i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood and we try to
 		we used to try to get together and i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking there's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's not as boring if you get several people and you can kind of talk and
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and it it makes it pass pretty quickly and the aerobics isn't too boring i kind of enjoy it when i'm doing it
 		um it's it's a lot more fun than some other things i could do i guess but uh i do i do have to make myself go and of course while i'm doing it i feel pretty good and after i get finished i feel great
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh it's great afterwards yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i can go in there i can be like a Friday afternoon when i'm tired it's the end of the week and i just want to go home and i'll make myself go and i'll have headache and everything and i get out i don't have a headache any more i feel great and i'm just
 		it's amazing how much better i feel and then just in general i sleep a lot better and i just feel much better i mean i've been kind of dragging the last few weeks and i know if i would just get around to exercising
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's right
 		exactly it does it gives you energy
 	
 	
 		i'd feel feel better but my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising well i'm too tired or i have a headache or well i just got over the flu and i'm still kind of draggy so i better not go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		it's kind of a vicious circle isn't it yeah i find too that i have more energy when i exercise and i and uh you know it's silly not to but i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is
 	
 	
 		it's just a put off i don't know why i don't do more and i and i know that it's good for my health i know you know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you know you not only you know you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit but you're probably prolonging your life so there's no reason that we shouldn't do it but i don't know
 	
 	
 		right
 		it's just hard to make yourself go and i i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night and i've been sweaty and and it you know i don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands so it kind of kills the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the evening for doing errands so i think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better of course i feel like once i've done it if i'm sweaty i might as well do an extra thirty more minutes because you've already kind of shot your night but
 	
 	
 		that's
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um so i'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday Thursday now that i can just kill two nights and and uh get a reasonable amount of workout in so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		does it cost the same for just two nights or
 	
 	
 		no it's less expensive this one was only forty five dollars but i'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too c heap i would talk myself out of going more probably
 	
 	
 		well that's good too
 		sure yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		since it's more expensive i think okay you spent that much money you'd better go
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right well do you have a facility right at the where you work
 	
 	
 		so hopefully
 		yeah yeah it's right there and it's they have a really nice facility at the TI they've got two different aerobics rooms they have the mirrors of course
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall you don't like to see how you work but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going but
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah
 		and then they hire private instructors they have oh that's great
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and they have ceiling fans in the rooms and it's it's a pretty nice setup um and of course it's real convenient because it is right there at work i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere i'd never make it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and just the fact that i can just go straight from my desk over to the the recreation center and do it helps a lot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i can see that would be uh easy they make it as easy as they possibly can for you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		well um do a lot of people take advantage of it
 	
 	
 		quite a few do they have probably ooh i'd say fifteen different fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running and they have them anywhere from six in the morning uh they have some during
 		during lunch hour that are shorter and i guess guys can take advantage of that for me i wouldn't have time to do an hour hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get get dressed again but there's a lot more guys that do that one and um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they have them you know in the in the evenings they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that so they have big variety they even have some uh
 		aerobic uh water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool i've never done that one before but
 	
 	
 		oh you have a pool there too oh how nice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		they've got an olympic pool and and basketball courts and sand volleyball they've got the full weight room and
 		uh the locker rooms with uh a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities and hair dryers and all the you know everything you'd need just about
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		it's a real it is a real nice facility it's also got a full inside inside basketball court and i think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things but it's it is very nice
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		i just don't take as much advantage of it as i should i mean i'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing but
 	
 	
 		now to use
 		well does it cost money like to use the to exercise in the weight room or to uh to take to go swimming do you have to pay for that too
 	
 	
 		yeah well you can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities and it's about eight dollars a month
 	
 	
 		oh that's not bad huh-uh
 	
 	
 		no not at all  pretty cheap
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership but
 		i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced from what i've heard
 	
 	
 		i think so too yeah yeah
 		well and and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics
 	
 	
 		oh yeah in fact uh the T TIer's families can can come in on these things
