 
     		
 	
 		okay the i guess the latest one that we've seen is uh Awakening with uh yeah that's with uh uh
 	
 	
 		Awakening
 		i haven't heard of that one
 	
 	
 		oh the guy that plays Mark uh Robin Williams and he played a terrific part in that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh that's one of the better ones we've seen in in the last oh i guess the last six months
 	
 	
 		yeah we just saw uh Flatliners last night that was really good
 	
 	
 		Flatliners i want i never did get to see that
 	
 	
 		oh that's a good movie
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		this uh Awakening i think is is something along the same lines
 	
 	
 		it's got some
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's uh about a doctor uh and it's a true story
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh there was a bunch of people that were uh they first of all they they  thought they had Parkinson Parkinson's disease
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they would tremble first start trembling real bad but then they would just go almost go into a coma
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		they they could tell that they were responding that they could hear you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it was just a blank stare you got and they were just almost frozen
 		in in in a position
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and they tried some uh
 		tried some drugs and then all of a sudden that one summer uh the drug that they gave them brought them out of their coma and that's where they got the word awakening
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but then they lapsed back into the coma
 		but uh
 		and Robert DeNiro played the uh played i guess uh the co-lead part he was one of the ones that were in a coma
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		when did this movie come out
 	
 	
 		oh it's been out i guess now for
 		or a month and a half or something like that
 	
 	
 		huh i haven't heard about that one
 	
 	
 		but if you get a chance see that i also want to see uh that uh Sleeping With The Enemy or Silence of the Lambs
 	
 	
 		oh that's a great a movie yeah we went to see that
 	
 	
 		i've heard that that's good
 	
 	
 		oh that's awesome
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah if you don't  you don't mind the the gross parts of it
 	
 	
 		yeah well i heard it's not really that that uh gross it's not like Friday the 13th or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		just the subtle kind of stuff though
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it uh Flatliners is a real good movie too i recommend renting that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's got some uh interesting things about it because you know you know what the plot is basically that they kill themselves and come back
 	
 	
 		yeah but they they're trying to experience uh life after death
 	
 	
 		yeah then when they come back all sorts of strange things start happening to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we don't see as many movies as we used to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we got a VCR so we go to Blockbuster
 		video place and rent the movies
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i i just did today i got uh Darkman have you seen that uh i haven't i'll guess i'll watch it tonight
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		yeah there was another good movie that Robin Williams played in uh that really surprised me it was uh Dead Poets Society
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i liked that one that was good
 	
 	
 		uh
 		but it
 		uh it's not typical Robin Williams i you know i expected some comedy or something like that but he he's a good dramatic actor actor when he wants to be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um yep
 		so what other movies have you rented recently
 	
 	
 		uh that Awakening i guess is the last movie we've been to in a couple months like i say we we uh our son one of our sons gave us for Christmas some Blockbuster uh gift certificates
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		we just go up and find some old movies that we haven't seen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		some of the old classics
 	
 	
 		what kind of movies are you into mostly
 	
 	
 		uh some some some of the like the uh Agatha Agatha Christie uh movies Murder On Orient Express and some of the others
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's a good one
 	
 	
 		course the new releases they're i don't know what the rule is now but i think they had
 		i don't know if it's a year or what before they put them on uh VCR so you can rent them yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it's about a year
 		actually i just uh they just put one out that's only been out for um

 		yeah
 		but some of the old ones that he put out like uh The Living Desert

 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i never did see that uh one that won uh so many Academy Awards that uh

 		um
 		about the Indian uh Dance With Wolves or something like that
 	
 	
 		The Wolves oh yeah
 		yeah that's pretty good that's a very good movie
 	
 	
 		i didn't see that i've heard some people say it's good and some people say it's they didn't like it course i guess you you can get that on any kind of movie you see
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		a long movie though
 	
 	
 		yeah i heard it's over three hours long
 		but uh
 		plus movies cost so much now unless you go to the early movie
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		down here i don't know what costs you up there but down here man and wife you're going to spend
 		if you for your tickets and any popcorn and cold drink you're going to spend close to fifteen dollars
 	
 	
 		that's about what it is here too
 		those three dollar drinks  three dollar popcorn
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and that they're awfully small too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it used to be the candy counter and stuff would have the small bars but now all they have is the big old family size bars
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah i just got some free passes for movies because i'm graduating
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i can use those
 	
 	
 		where where are you attending school
 	
 	
 		NC State
 	
 	
 		NC State
 	
 	
 		yeah graduating Computer Science
 	
 	
 		how'd y'all do in basketball this year
 	
 	
 		oh we did pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		y'all usually always have a good basketball
 	
 	
 		yeah next year we're not going to have anybody though because all our seniors are leaving
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah well this is football country down here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		although Arkansas had a pretty good basketball team
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  yeah  as always
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		well
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i was trying to think of something else i i do miss uh i'm i'm fifty seven years old and you don't sound like you're that old
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		twenty two
 	
 	
 		but uh i remember when i was a kid kid and you'd go to the movies and you got to see a movie and usually a double feature
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you got to see a newsreel
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and usually a serial like Flash Gordon or or uh Zorro or something like that line
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then a cartoon
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		at least one cartoon sometimes two cartoons
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you could spend almost all afternoon at the movie just watching movies and
 		other stuff but now it it's the movie and the previews and that's about it
 	
 	
 		and the ads
 	
 	
 		and the ads
 	
 	
 		throw a Coke ad in there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but a lot of times we would go to the movies just to see the cartoons and the serial
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because you always wondered
 		how can the guy get out of this
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then the next yeah cliffhangers and the next week you'd find out how he got out of it
 	
 	
 		cliffhanger
 		and into something else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well i enjoyed talking with you
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		and good luck in your schooling
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay have a good day bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye all right bye
