 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well um so um have do you have a son or daughter that's looking for a college
 	
 	
 		uh been through it
 	
 	
 		ah i'm still in it
 	
 	
 		okay  no we've uh we've had two children graduate so and i have worked at universities
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it was a topic that uh seemed appropriate as far as discussion like this
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you had you're in the process of planning for or your children are there
 	
 	
 		no i'm i'm i'm i'm still in college i'm still a student
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay all right
 	
 	
 		i'm graduating this May yeah
 	
 	
 		this May well good where are you
 	
 	
 		uh North Carolina State University
 	
 	
 		very good uh uh the uh planning for college tuition and all the associated costs is a tough tough decision  at
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think it's it's when you're looking for a college that you want to go i think you really should know exactly what you want to be so you can pick the best quality
 	
 	
 		how did you choose North Carolina State
 	
 	
 		i chose it basically that way uh North Carolina State has a reputation for being uh good agricultural school
 	
 	
 		um-hum it's a land grant university right
 	
 	
 		in the area
 		exactly and um they have a good extension service for agriculture and uh i wanted to go into agriculture so i came here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and since since i was in you know in-state i pay resident i pay resident tuition so it was also a it was also good for me because you know being a good school plus in-state tuition saved me a lot of money
 	
 	
 		the
 		oh yes it certainly does and familiarity with the area there's sometimes advantages to moving way off and going to a unknown area but uh there's as many
 	
 	
 		right well for example yeah yeah i i think that's very true because for example uh i'm going to graduate school after i finish here and uh i'm going to go to California
 	
 	
 		to stay in the same area
 		yeah uh two reasons for that i think if they even recommend in advanced degrees to
 		uh try a different set of teachers get a different perspective as far as the the advanced degrees they'd like for you to change rather than stay in the same institution
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean they would like for you to stay so that you know
 		they they could keep getting your money but one you know an employer likes to see different schools i think
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum and i and i think a very good advisor would uh tell you that it's best for you anyway to get a different uh
 		different set of instructors on it and a little different outlook and plus there are regional differences i think too California may have a different
 		type of emphasis now agriculture changes by region as far as it's emphasis is concerned middle of the country would be wheat land here it's tobacco and uh California it may be
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh more of the grapes and and uh other types of
 	
 	
 		right they have in California they have a lot of heavy metal problems also and a lot of salts because of the valleys very very salty
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's what i i was interested when i went over there i i uh talked to some people in the university
 		i think also you know um dialogue between university professors helps a lot in decisions because i think that's what really turned me
 		towards that you know the the school that i'm going to is i went and talked to the people in the school and they gave me information which i could not have gotten otherwise and that that really finalized my decision
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah what is your specialty
 	
 	
 		well i'm graduating with just a soil science degree here in North Carolina but i hopefully will go to California to receive a PhD in uh
 		soil science with a specialization in environmental  environmental quality
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which will deal with uh eco-toxicology heavy metals and soils and things like that so away from the production agriculture end of it and more into the soils and you know contaminants
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i'm kind of branching off into a pretty specific region which i think is going to be a hot topic in the future with you know all these lands and and things that are being spoiled
 	
 	
 		no question
 	
 	
 		and how to how to remediate them and all
 	
 	
 		no question you i'm sure you you and your classmates have been following the uh
 		waste situation in North Carolina and the the absence or facility to handle
 	
 	
 		right especially in the sounds
 	
 	
 		right and it's it's a universal problem you know
 		if you look at uh some countries you expect them to have problems Latin America now with cholera and and a bunch of other problems associated with
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		waste management
 		the United States you can expect more out of but we still have the same very deep problem of how to take care of our waste we create a bunch now now what do we do with it
 	
 	
 		yeah now that now that it's getting harder to get permits for landfills uh the the problem's pressing down harder than ever
 	
 	
 		yeah and then i think there's a a big mistrust public mistrust as there is with nuclear energy
 		uh they were talking about Chernobyl again this this week because it's an anniversary but i think there's a big mistrust of uh
 		some of the waste management companies in terms of how well they do take care of their product
 		and that's got to be solved i think there has to be public trust in it before you can
 	
 	
 		yes uh i agree with you
 	
 	
 		find a good sight
 		well i wish you luck in California
 	
 	
 		yeah uh thanks a lot it was nice talking to you all right bye
 	
 	
 		okay
 		same here bye
