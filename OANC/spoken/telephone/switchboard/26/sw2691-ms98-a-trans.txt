 
     		
 	
 		okay Jay where do you live in Texas
 	
 	
 		i live in Dallas um
 	
 	
 		in Dallas
 	
 	
 		right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state and a uh that goes east and west and a north south tollway
 	
 	
 		what's that the I-30 and Central Express
 	
 	
 		it's no it's called 635's the highway it's the looper that goes around the city and then uh the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway just moved here about uh
 	
 	
 		okay yeah
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh uh one about a month ago after twenty one years two miles to the east
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 		oh how about that
 	
 	
 		so it's a very different house from the typical Dallas
 		uh house
 	
 	
 		it's a new home
 	
 	
 		it's about eight years old it's uh it's a duplex type thing uh very modern and um very open and airy light
 	
 	
 		about eight years
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's different than those than the long Texas ramblers um-hum
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh well we we live in a brick story and a half um
 	
 	
 		what's your house like
 	
 	
 		Cape Cod style i guess you'd call it and uh a big
 	
 	
 		oh great yeah
 	
 	
 		sun room on the back of it
 		it
 	
 	
 		so it's got a lot a openness openness openness and light also
 	
 	
 		no  have
 	
 	
 		oh it doesn't well that's what my wife really wanted and so uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		with openness and light i understand that i would love that too
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 		uh our our last house wasn't too bad but it was just too traditional and so if uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah this is very traditional
 	
 	
 		the next the next time uh probably a year and a half from now we're gonna try to build
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so make one really um contemporary and and very modern and very open and very light
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you have children at home
 	
 	
 		no i have three in college they they usually get back for the least two of them for the summer so
 	
 	
 		three oh boy
 		you still need space plenty of space
 	
 	
 		but
 		still need a little bit of space we we have a lot less than we had uh recently already cut back
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 		uh-huh well
 	
 	
 		how big is your place
 	
 	
 		it's uh oh about twenty five thousand twenty five hundred square feet i guess
 	
 	
 		oh that's  good size
 	
 	
 		it's four bedrooms and two baths
 	
 	
 		yeah we we had
 	
 	
 		and that it has one wing built on it's a kitchen family room and then uh big room on the back
 	
 	
 		yeah we had four bedrooms two and a half baths uh in the place we just left
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so down now we're down to two and two
 	
 	
 		two and two uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum so it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home but it won't be that long because we not for sure you know how long they're gonna stay or whatever
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh i was just reading an article um
 		that there were nineteen thousand properties available in Texas uh for sale by the Resolution Resolution Trust Company Corporation repossessed
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes and if you can get in the if if if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal
 	
 	
 		i i guess so
 	
 	
 		uh we we really didn't go that route and didn't look uh but um
 		the plenty of them and the and the housing market probably still gonna even go lower there are many many houses just for sale just by the regular route
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		that's discouraging if you own property
 	
 	
 		yeah and we just decided uh uh sell and we got we got a pretty good price uh for for what we had uh not as good as it would've been
 	
 	
 		few years
 	
 	
 		say three or four years ago but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that um
 		that was just the timing
 	
 	
 		right well our daughter and son-in-law moved up back up here he's from Texas but course she's from here um
 		about a year and a half ago
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and had their house on the market down there and they never did sell it so they stayed six months and she got her job back and he got a job down there because
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well yeah they're not moving very well for sure
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 		no
 	
 	
 		and that's a good uh
 		example of it
 	
 	
 		they live in Rowlett
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i know where that is i've been we've been here twenty five years i'm from Missouri and my wife's from Kansas so
 	
 	
 		have you
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i teach i teach at a college here so it's uh
 		it's sort of home now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		what college are you teaching at
 	
 	
 		i'm uh uh one of the Brookhaven uh it's called Brookhaven College it's one of the community colleges
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's just about two miles to the west of where i'm living so it's very nice very convenient
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		only one i know is Richardson
