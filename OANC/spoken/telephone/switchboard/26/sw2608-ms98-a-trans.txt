 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		do you want to go first
 	
 	
 		you can go first or i will
 	
 	
 		well you go ahead
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well i'm going to tell you what i'd have
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		down in the South we have a lot of shrimp
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		okay and i have uh shrimp that is steamed in beer that i cook
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook garlic bread green salad tea and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert
 	
 	
 		oh it sounds fantastic
 	
 	
 		yes and what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your uh like your rice steamer your rice cooker
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um you place the shrimp in the
 		in the rice steamer and you put a bay leaf and put some uh red pepper over it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now you can either use you know the kind that comes in the little can or you can just get some you know regular red peppers
 	
 	
 		is it cayenne pepper you mean
 	
 	
 		cayenne uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you put a little bit of that over it now if you use the dried kind
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		then you would only use two of them and you put that in there and then you pour two bottles of beer over it
 	
 	
 		and how much shrimp would you use
 	
 	
 		two pounds
 	
 	
 		two pounds okay
 	
 	
 		that's the jumbo shrimp in the shells leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you pour the beer over the top of it and you cover it and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and the shrimp turn pink then you remove it and you put it on a platter and then you serve it with melted butter and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i usually put garlic powder in mine
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but uh then the microwave uh the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave and what you do is you just uh wash it and you core it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in a like a oh what do you call it like Pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		a glass dish uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but it's got to have one that has a cover on it
 	
 	
 		okay uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you uh put about two tablespoons of uh water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then you just set your cauliflower in there and then you cook it for seven minutes on high and you rotate it one time
 	
 	
 		and it's are you cooking the whole head at one time okay
 	
 	
 		uh-huh you uh when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and uh you just set it in there and you microwave it on high for seven minutes and you turn it one time and while that's cooking i take mayonnaise about a cup of mayonnaise
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder and i mix it all together and i shred up some just regular white cheese
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that and you cook it for another three minutes on high
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it and it's done
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh that sounds fantastic
 	
 	
 		it is good but it it looks i mean what you can do then see is like what i usually do is i'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle and then i put the uh shrimp around the outside of it you know on my platter
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then i have a green salad that i put around the outside of that
 		and you know you have all the different seasonings and stuff and then i just fix little individual cups for them and they have the garlic bread and it makes it a real nice looking
 	
 	
 		sure
 		and it's not much work
 	
 	
 		you know
 		huh-uh huh-uh but it looks like it you know  you look like you went to a whole bunch
 	
 	
 		that sounds
 		yeah really i bet it tastes good too
 	
 	
 		right and uh usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it you know and i'll lay those on top of my salad you know to make it look nice and things like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		sure
 		now how many could you serve
 	
 	
 		okay uh it usually serves six
 	
 	
 		yeah okay okay i figured about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 		see out here we have so many uh ethnic people we have Italians and we have Portuguese and we have Russians and Polish and
 		it depends out here like the type of people you're going to entertain
 		you know so it's hard uh you you just have to pick something for the the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh they're big on finger food here too you know chicken wings and uh ribs and that kind of stuff uh barbecue
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh cooking out in the yard it yard you know when it's nice barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah have you ever had crawfish
 	
 	
 		uh no but i have had shrimp
 	
 	
 		oh you ought to try some crawfish they are good but see that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over
 		you know even if it's like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking
 	
 	
 		oh of course that's
 	
 	
 		you know they want it from down here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because just like now especially crawfish it is starting to move out you know and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is
 	
 	
 		really is it like shrimp
 	
 	
 		but
 		uh it's similar uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's similar
 	
 	
 		yeah it's not exactly i mean it's got a taste of its own you know but it is it is similar to because you only eat the tails of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh it does
 		does it look like a lobster
 	
 	
 		um it looks more like a crab
 	
 	
 		oh it looks more like a crab oh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but
 	
 	
 		are they thin long
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		or wide
 	
 	
 		um let me think of
 		i can't even think of what you i guess if it uh it looks like more like a cross between uh a crab and uh and a lobster because it's small like that and it's got the pinchers like a crab but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you know it's it's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a lobster would
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yep
 	
 	
 		and we call them mud bugs
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i mean they're fantastic tasting they are so good everybody it's it's the season for them right now
 	
 	
 		and and where did you say you were from
 	
 	
 		Louisiana
 	
 	
 		Louisiana oh well do you do cajun cooking
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i love uh blackened you know uh the the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff oh we have a few places up here that do that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and if ever i see it on the menu i always get it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it is so good
 	
 	
 		yeah you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		now how do they do the blackened
 	
 	
 		you buy it you buy it as a seasoning
 	
 	
 		but uh do you have to have a certain skillet or something
 	
 	
 		huh-uh huh-uh i cook mine well do you have a uh like a black iron skillet
 	
 	
 		no
 		i did have i don't have it now but i have mostly Teflon
 	
 	
 		oh okay well i guess you could cook it in in that too but i don't know you know i never have i use uh uh the black iron skillet to cook mine
 	
 	
 		you now but uh
 		does does it have to get extremely hot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but it really it's not it it it doesn't burn or anything like that the blackening is really the seasoning
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh oh oh i see
 	
 	
 		i mean there is it's it's a blackening seasoning
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i mean that is a seasoning that's really it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		because it's called uh
 		what it's called is Blackening Magic and it it comes in a bottle and uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well i'm trying to see it's got a a picture of Dom De Luise on it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh now would you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time is that what you're saying
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		because i could have the uh chicken on the skewers
 		with uh uh blackened seasoning
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and oh that is so good delicious
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it i mean your pan it does have to be really hot you know when you put it in but it's not like it's burned and it what it what blackens it is the seasoning
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it is so good oh
 	
 	
 		it is i i love it i i in fact i was in Texas for a little while and i liked uh the barbecues and the Mexican food
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i have a passion for all that type of different tastes because i have been brought up mostly Italian American food because my uh parents are Italian and Portuguese
 		so we cook a lot of pasta and uh gravies and pizzas and you know roasts and that kind of thing that's why i enjoy going to restaurants and have you know trying different things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana you know to visit
 	
 	
 		i would love to
 	
 	
 		yeah you ought to come down um you don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans you know if you want to really get some good food
 	
 	
 		i
 		really
 	
 	
 		i mean you don't have to go that far south
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as i'm concerned and fact is we're going to take a vacation this year we're going to go to New Orleans again and uh
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we're only going down there for the food though
 		
 
 	
 	
 		now where where do you go when you go there uh right on Basin Street and those places
 	
 	
 		uh yeah we go to the the French Quarters and stuff like that and uh i have some friends that live down there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so usually we go to we don't go to the tourist ones we go to the ones that they tell us to go to you know
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and we went to this one it was called The Back Porch and uh
 		they were cooking the stuff you know while we were we went on this boat ride and then we came back and ate out on this it was like a back porch
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		and uh usually if you can find somebody of course now when you go down there you know i mean they've got just there's no where you can miss
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i have never gone to a restaurant and not just been so full it's unreal and uh i mean it's so good the seasoning they it's just unreal
 	
 	
 		really
 		and don't they make a lot of um i'm trying to think what they call their soup i don't know
 	
 	
 		gumbo

 		uh-huh
 		and i'll tell you what
 	
 	
 		see we do um uh a thing we call it a sea bake you uh you take clams
