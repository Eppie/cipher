 		who've
 		that like that neither have i
 	
 	
 		no isn't that funny i usually get some place i got a woman in New Jersey the last time i called i think
 	
 	
 		right that's funny
 	
 	
 		that is funny so the weather
 	
 	
 		so how's the building how's the weather in building two
 	
 	
 		the weather in building two is cold  it's been cold in the building outside the building's not bad not bad typical TI Spring or TI listen i got me doing it typical Texas Spring are you a native to Texas
 	
 	
 		ugh
 		oh yeah
 		no no i'm i'm a transplant from California
 	
 	
 		from
 		so what do you think of the Texas weather
 	
 	
 		not as nice as California
 	
 	
 		how long have you been here
 	
 	
 		oh five years now i've been here long enough pretty long so
 	
 	
 		oh okay you
 		you you you know about August then
 	
 	
 		yes oh i've been through five of those
 	
 	
 		okay there's no surprises left
 	
 	
 		right right a lot of people try to leave the state for a couple weeks in August for you know if they're going to go out of state for vacation that's the time to go
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		good idea real good idea
 	
 	
 		yeah we went up to Wyoming this last uh Summer during that time and it was like you know eighty degrees up there it was beautiful it was nice to get out of Texas for a while
 	
 	
 		we went to Alaska
 	
 	
 		well that's that's the even even farther away
 	
 	
 		that is really nice it is so cool you wear a jacket you know or or
 	
 	
 		even in the Summer time huh
 	
 	
 		yeah or keep one handy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because it's it rains a lot in Alaska
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		uh it they call it their liquid gold
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		um
 	
 	
 		but it you know you get sunshine and it's lovely and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green and blooming oh my goodness it's pretty well Texas isn't bad
 	
 	
 		green
 		um
 		right
 		no no
 	
 	
 		not in the Spring
 	
 	
 		right i i i have to think every year to try to remember what it was what's it supposed to like this time of year
 	
 	
 		Spring is nice
 	
 	
 		yeah because March we usually get a lot of rain
 		in March you you know it'll seem the the news the Harold Taft
 		you know on the local news he's says oh March we typically get a lot of rain and we've had this many inches and you know we're right on target you know and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March but i you have to it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like but i guess yeah i wish i just wish it wouldn't come all at once  and it and
 	
 	
 		oh we always
 		we we always do though
 		uh it
 		that's right and then we get all that heat
 	
 	
 		right well it's just that you know when it rains it rains you know in California you get these nice lovely rains you know nothing really downpours you know like downpours like you have here you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the other day we had some hail the biggest hail i've ever seen in Texas yeah when i live in Garland
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh you got into that bad stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah we got hail the size of marbles
 		i mean just just so noisy hitting the house and the glass on the windows it didn't break anything but
 		we went out there afterwards and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn
 	
 	
 		isn't that strange
 	
 	
 		i know i just you pick them up you know and they're they're perfectly round you know and i go gee how did they form you know and have so perfect like that
 	
 	
 		isn't i
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		i think that's one of the strange strange things and you very seldom see it though
 	
 	
 		right right you i've i've seen hail you know but they're usually the size you know of a
 		tiny tiny pebbles you know really small
 		you know but this was uh really large
 	
 	
 		so it had come it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently is that correct
 	
 	
 		uh uh i don't know how hail's formed tell you the truth you don't think it's cold enough you know to
 	
 	
 		i think i think that's
 	
 	
 		to
 	
 	
 		it's not on the ground but in in the clouds it is
 	
 	
 		right must be
 		i guess and it doesn't i think you know all that falling would warm it up and melt it but it maybe that's what rounds it i don't know but tumbling
 	
 	
 		i was dumb i was in uh Florida for a week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		on business and uh i had called back to the house i stayed the weekend and i called back to the house my housekeeper was babysitting my cats and dogs
 		said something to the effect of now we've made the national news don't get upset and don't worry it's in Garland where all the bad weather is i said okay
 		you know and i watched the news and i thought ha ha that's Garland that's not Plano i don't have anything to worry about i was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me stupid you own property in Garland
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		felt so dumb finally i got home found out my property was okay there was no problem with it but i guess you just tend to think of of where your house is you know and nothing else
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 		right
 		right and close to that what's it's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland that's the part that always seems to to get hardest hit when there's there's the hard rain the the creek overflows and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		a lot of houses a lot of houses around that creek seem to to get flooded the streets and stuff around that area get a lot of flooding
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		the house that house that i bought is close to a Firewheel Firewheel
 		Firewheel golf course
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it's just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through
 	
 	
 		right that's where i live close to that
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah uh uh not quite uh i don't live in that Firewheel division
 		but i live close by there in north far north Garland yeah they're supposed to it it's getting built up you know with more new new shopping centers and and things you know it's a fairly new area
 	
 	
 		is that a nice area
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh
 		and they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by by the next by ninety three or ninety four or something a brand new mall
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		not too far away from that area so it should be nice
 	
 	
 		the house that the house that i bought was really really nice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh in the Firewheel Estates there whatever uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yes yes really really nice home very pretty uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but you're not living there right now
 	
 	
 		no i'm going to lease it it's it's investment property
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		i see
 	
 	
 		but it is really it's a very nice place uh i i would cheerfully live there at you know of course it's not my home and
 		and i've lived in my home in well almost ten years and you know i've got everything just exactly like i want it but if i were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards it's a nice house i like it
 	
 	
 		right
 		it should
 		yeah that's a nice area is it on the golf course or
 	
 	
 		no it's not it's off the golf course and i'll be honest with you i have i'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		it's but it's in the estates that adjoin it
 	
 	
 		yeah right right well that's a nice area
 	
 	
 		yes it is
 	
 	
 		that really is a nice area when they get that highway finished finished you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick
 	
 	
 		yeah that one ninety that one ninety is just going to be the most outermost outermost loop around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right another belt line just uh farther out go
 	
 	
 		right just continue to do that
 	
 	
 		right right right
 	
 	
 		where are you from in California
 	
 	
 		southern California uh
 	
 	
 		San Diego
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i've lived in San Diego for six years when i was a kid younger and
 		and LA area and my parents live in Anaheim right now
 		lived up in in north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks
 		area where the Cowboys have their training camp or used to anyways
 	
 	
 		i've been through all of that uh there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks north of Los Angeles that's really an eerie strange looking area with boulders uh i wonder they're not really hills they're more like just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		was it
 	
 	
 		huge boulders with very little vegetation
 	
 	
 		huh i'm not familiar with what is it along the coast or
 		or more inland
 	
 	
 		uh very
 		well you know it may be a little bit more inland that is one of the strangest areas i have ever seen
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh i had to go up TI on business a couple of years ago
 	
 	
 		out there huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we went up that coastline and i was just amazed how unusual that looks
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		here hang on just a second i've got a Los Angeles map let me just quick
 	
 	
 		yeah they have some pretty nice weather out there in Los Angeles
 	
 	
 		uh
 		Simi Valley
 	
 	
 		Simi Valley okay i know where that is
 	
 	
 		yes
 		beyond Thousand Oaks
 	
 	
 		i know where Simi Valley is i've been out there before sure
 	
 	
 		you don't think that's strange looking
 	
 	
 		i didn't notice anything strange i guess
 	
 	
 		oh okay maybe i'm maybe i'm used to Texas
 	
 	
 		about it
 		maybe Texas the way
 	
 	
 		the elevation is extremely high
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's got curving roads on it but but the it's just a strange landscape there's very little vegetation
 	
 	
 		huh i didn't i don't remember seeing that part of it i know Simi Valley yeah it's just a suburb of LA and they've built some new highways out to that area and things lately
 	
 	
 		right it's a far
 	
 	
 		people can get in and out of LA faster easier
 	
 	
 		maybe it's a place i went to it was uh far extreme thought we'd never find the place
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it was interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that sounds interesting
 	
 	
 		because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way
 	
 	
 		right right right i i know exactly i i i lived that area it's a nice area out there i love Thousand Oaks uh
 		Texas i don't know things things you just have a less a variety i guess it's
 		i think i don't think it's quite as green you know it it's green with all the trees and things out here but it's just
 	
 	
 		oh it's green sometime
 	
 	
 		yeah but it's just you know i don't know
 	
 	
 		well it doesn't stay green you know the really and and in all honesty i i know this sounds like a Texas story all honesty you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years we haven't had a really bad one
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i i
 		i missed that one of eighty or eighty two or eighty one that had the heat wave
 	
 	
 		uh it was maybe eighty two because we bought our house in eighty one and we built a pool in eighty two
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no
