 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		but a lot of women are knowledge as knowledge about football as i am
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		can i guess your favorite team if you had one might be the Steelers well i can understand that i you know i kind of like the Cowboys too
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 		do you
 	
 	
 		they've had some great games in the past
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i i always enjoy watching this Dallas the Dallas and Pittsburgh together you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh me too
 		it wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys i'll tell you he lives in the Dallas area now as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		
 
 		does he really
 	
 	
 		well actually it's probably closer to Fort Worth but it's it's in the same area he bought uh bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke Texas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often as a matter of fact there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh wow i wonder if he'd ever do that
 	
 	
 		i don't know he'd be good at it he's such a motivator he primarily you know with the quarterbacks that would be his specialty i wished i wished they could work something i really like him i really do
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh well what about the Houston Oilers do you like them
 	
 	
 		yeah okay i'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl that would be really great
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that may not ever happen i don't know uh Houston has had some wonderful talent you know down through the years and in the earlier years they really had some super teams
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh and Warren Moon is is proving himself quite well right now
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		he certainly is he's very good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh he's one of the few uh black quarterbacks that there are
 	
 	
 		he's very good
 		that's right Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia i guess last year but he's no longer with the team
 		so you're right there are very few black quarterbacks or at least that are starting anyway how do you think the Steelers are going to do this year you have any idea
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i don't know i hope they they do better they they during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i think they still have a little i think they're still such a a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential  that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah that was just such super team
 	
 	
 		or if they even reach that potential again you know they may never reach that again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's a tough it would be tough to do it really would they have such a super team for years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that won what four Super Bowls
 	
 	
 		yeah four in a row
 	
 	
 		four in a row i don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying but basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right  and
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		i think Mike Webster was left but then he he just left uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		he may have been the last of the old guard i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah i think he is i think he was
 	
 	
 		yeah they had such a super team
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i didn't
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		there's quite a bit of activity now of course they had so many you know nice uh choices because their record was so lousy the last few years they picked up you know quiet a few
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 	
 	
 		of the of course you never know the guys they pick you know may may never play a game you just never know it's it's a gamble it really is they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		well who would you say is your favorite player or has ever been your favorite player
 	
 	
 		ever been
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		probably an old guy that played probably before you were born  his name was Sam Huff he used to play for the New York Giants
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that was one of the toughest guys that i've ever seen in my life as far as you know dedication he just went all out every single play of course there have been some other great ones too Dick Butkis and Bradshaw you know there's been so many
 	
 	
 		really
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but if i had to pick one i would probably pick Sam Huff as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		oh you know that's really funny um well i i come from a large family and there there's quite a few boys so that's kind of how i got in with the football either watch that or watch nothing and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		at one time i could name all the players on the Steelers you know and but even when Bradshaw was playing i i don't know i i didn't particularly care for him i thought he was kind of cocky or something uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		he is he is of course there a quarterback has a big ego
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they really do they have to have they can't survive
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they always think they can win you know which is the way it should be and boy he never gave up i'll tell you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah him and Franco Harris i really didn't care for the either two of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean they were good but i you know you couldn't deny that but i didn't i thought you know well i just didn't really care for either one of them uh today  my favorites out of those guys were probably um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Lambert Ham and uh Stallworth and Swan
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh absolutely i can't disagree with that they were super players they really were they really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh i i i like not just with the Pittsburgh i like watching on Saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or the the best plays from you know from the week or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah highlights yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i love watching that then i like watching their bloopers too you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah that's kind of funny too as a matter of fact  some of them a a bit embarrassing
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah well they make mistakes too i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh it's funny that more people don't get hurt
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		you know especially i would say the receivers when they're in the air and they get tackled
 	
 	
 		uh-huh go ahead
 		they take such a beating
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's funny some of their necks don't get broken
 	
 	
 		absolutely i don't know how they do it it's it must just take a hundred percent concentration i guess because they know they're going to get hit it's just a matter of how hard you know or where
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		an they have to be in ideal physical shape basically
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely they look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem gosh what a beating they really do take a beating they really do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well what did you think of um a couple years ago for the Bears the refrigerator
 	
 	
 		i think he was just probably a passing phenomena i think  i don't know i i'm
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		knowing what you know of course Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach is knowing his or you know knowing of his temperament i'm just surprised he ever you know kept the guy around i really am he's such a he's about a half hot head anyway such a temper
 	
 	
 		oh you know and to me he does um oh he's just so big and fat he doesn't even look like he's in shape he's just so big no one can move him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right yeah absolutely there's just so much mass there i guess they just can't i don't know you know i probably the guy is you know probably physically strong i you know obviously not very fast but i guess it's just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like you say a mass that nobody can seem to to get out of the way as far as him scoring touch downs you know i think that was kind of weird i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Dallas has a guy uh his name is Nate Newton now he has a real weight problem too he fights it every single year but he manages to still keep playing but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he has a terrible weight problem
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		they watch the coaches watch him all year long they they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not you know completely out of control
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i guess most every team has some has someone like that i don't know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah there's there are some really big guys playing in football
 	
 	
 		absolutely they get bigger and bigger it seems every year i guess you have to to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		know to stay in the game i guess yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah you would
 		uh-huh um now who would you say that you have a favorite i mean other than Dallas would you say that you have uh a favorite quarterback i mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the the attention you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah sure well you'd have to uh or i would have to say you know someone like Montana i guess who's done so well for so many years
 	
 	
 		yeah i really i i enjoy watching him play
 	
 	
 		yeah his age is about to catch up with him though
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he's no Spring chicken anymore and like you say Warren Moon's an excellent Warren Moon's an excellent but he's very exciting to watch uh-huh sure uh-huh absolutely
 	
 	
 		no but he's still performing
 		yes he is i i i enjoy watching him also
 		what about uh Marino
 	
 	
 		uh i'm obviously he's a very good quarterback i'd i never was you know too a whole lot of a big fan you know
 	
 	
 		i think he'll get better as he gets older
 	
 	
 		yeah he may uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because he he well was he was the youngest quarterback there was wasn't he
 	
 	
 		yes he was i believe that's right at one point in time yeah but he's a very young fellow yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot if he's got a good supporting cast you know  if not he gets beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway you know well Dallas did better last year hopefully they'll do better this year
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true
 		uh probably around twelve
 		uh-huh
 		yeah um i didn't i don't know i i just think you know Marino will get better and uh his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl you know so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right that's right yeah Miami's had some down years too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they all do i guess it's it's cyclical i guess as the players get older get slower
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah  that's true yeah and with age comes you know the the i'm sure arthritis sets in with them you know right yeah
 	
 	
 		get slower
 		
 
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		oh yes very much so hip injuries and things like that yeah yeah that that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and they're so young but they're retired you know and their so young still
 	
 	
 		that's right uh-huh yeah i read some time well not too long ago that the average
 		uh professional career only lasts seven years so that's when you think about it that's really not a very long time of course
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that
 	
 	
 		yeah but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years you know
 	
 	
 		yeah a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		holy smokes i didn't  that doesn't seem like very long
 	
 	
 		that's that's a pretty short career on average
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of course they play their you know cards right and do some good investments they'll you know they'll do all right but a lot of them don't unfortunately
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah um what do you think of the uh LA Raiders used to the the Oakland
 	
 	
 		yeah they they're always branded you know as a bunch of outlaws and if their if their
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know arrest record won't let able won't let them play anywhere else they seem to go to they seem to go to the Raiders but that just may be you know perceived
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know perception i don't know Al Davis is he's a kind of strange character strange strange looking guy apparently he's
 		kind of a wild guy i don't really know for sure they've had some excellent teams though obviously i'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play they keeping talk about you know going
 	
 	
 		yes they have uh-huh
