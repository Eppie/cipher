 
     		
 	
 		i just pressed my uh
 	
 	
 		we're supposed to talk about recent political developments
 	
 	
 		i got one that's interesting not too controversial not too controversial i you know not doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican i i do get somewhat of a kick out of
 		because Schwartzkopf or the other generals who i admire how everyone wants to make get them in politics i think that's kind of an interesting recent thing that that i could think of recently that uh i was wondering what you thought about that making the generals uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		getting a general into politics
 	
 	
 		they want him because he's popular not because he can do the job
 	
 	
 		right although i've i've been thinking about it and i uh i kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero those we're looking for a hero although Time magazine was saying that in essence the the general's staff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		was comparing to corporate presidents and they said that in general generals are more familiar with training that they believe in training more
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they are much more educated than the average corporate president and so the really were very positive on a general's staff person having a a very much better education than the average uh corporate president so i thought well maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i think they probably have a better education than the average congressman
 	
 	
 		well that too that too and uh you know they talk about the Army and because of the war and why did we win and all that and they talked about how the training was so important and that's so important in industry so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know they're liable to be right that that generals generals in the service and Schwartzkopf uh you know might make a good uh politician whether it be Governor or whatever you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		he he you know we know he's a good leader we know he's a good organizer the question is you know can he be the man who's ultimately responsible you know like what he said is
 		you know a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about you know people asking why are you doing this why are you doing that he says i'm following the orders of my President i'm not the one who writes the orders i'm just the one who follows them
 	
 	
 		yeah it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs you know everyone has a boss of course
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well you know Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so he went to the President and said okay here's how i want to do it but uh he wasn't the one that decided that Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait
 	
 	
 		no that's true that's true
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh you you you pick one i i i just thought of that one when when they brought up about politics that was uh pretty easy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you don't have to pick Democratic or Republican you can pick anything you want go ahead
 	
 	
 		well the the thing that i'm wondering about is how we get a new congress how do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long how do we get them
 		to not get reelected over and over again
 	
 	
 		well i have an easy answer for that oh i wish they would do it is that limit it you know to eight or ten years max you know whether that's two five year terms or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think
 		yeah
 		that may be our only answer but i don't really like it
 		i don't like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve
 	
 	
 		oh you know you're not
 	
 	
 		because i think if the President be him Republican or Democrat i think if the President can prove
 		that he's popular you know that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want i think the reason why we've got these guys in congress is because of the fund-raising rules i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year did they get after they were elected just you know just after they were elected two years ago
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		basically the people as soon as they get elected the people dump all kinds of money on them and say yeah yeah you're my friend you're my friend and two years later he remembers that so what they've done is bought this congressman for two years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i don't know i do like the the limitation of the President and uh i think there is a needed change i
 		i i think the same thing should happen for Congress uh i'd like you know that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years my God it's ridiculous you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		um-hum
 		that's that's the easy way i think the harder way out would be to make the uh the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground
 	
 	
 		we had
 	
 	
 		and that's that's what the financing rules and the uh the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff
 	
 	
 		i think voting is a problem i think i had one of the subject about voting and uh voting apathy or something like that and i think that uh the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time i i can't believe that a country our big
 		votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock at night you know of course they have absentee which is getting to be more a lot easier and i i vote as often on absentee as i can because it's so easy now but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think gee whiz you could make it a couple days uh it's just uh if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think a lot more people could vote if
 		they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know like you know the the recent uh election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up that election last December
 	
 	
 		are you in Dallas
 	
 	
 		i'm in yeah i'm in Dallas city limit
 	
 	
 		boy i i am in Arlington i am so happy not to be part of Dallas when i see those those folks there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes
 		it's an ugly mess
 	
 	
 		i mean uh i don't know if you like the mayor but i think your mayor the city council the what is the woman's name whose uh not the mayor but the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		the manager
 	
 	
 		yeah the city manager all of them need to be thrown out i mean they're just awful they're awful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't yeah well what get's me you know this thing it went down to defeat last December by how many votes by just a few hundred votes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and if if it had passed if these people had gotten out the vote it would have passed and there'd be no more argument but they're still fighting about it because of the way that election went last December
 	
 	
 		i know
 		it's so awful that uh politicians always spent consulting money that we put them in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to buy consultants and then they don't even do that recommendation you know i mean it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		um-hum yeah
 		but but this was for supposedly to benefit the minorities and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote and they would have had their way
 	
 	
 		well you're right there
 		you're right there uh uh people are uh uh politics uh the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really
 	
 	
 		yeah it's pretty sad
 	
 	
 		yeah it is uh uh hopefully people will get more involved uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh my my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going
 	
 	
 		oh yeah but but those are the ones that are complaining i i think a lot i see it here at TI
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the guys that don't take any interest in and and constantly on the negative of everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		and and you ask them why they don't vote they say well they don't want their name on the uh jury duty list
 	
 	
 		is that right ooh
 	
 	
 		that that's where they get the jury duty list is from the voter registration list
 	
 	
 		right you're right you're right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think they could do more about uh voting
 	
 	
 		i think they could
 	
 	
 		what are the issues i i'm a Democrat i want to just say that i'm so sad that there isn't a strong Democrat i don't even know i could i could go out and
 		and debate George Bush better than i see any Democrat doing it you know i mean at least i'd like to see competition because i like competition you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead i'm so disgusted with the Democratic party i can not believe it you know
 	
 	
 		in Presidential races that's about what they've done but they've got a pretty good lock on Congress and a lot of local things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i still think in the last uh ten years you know of course that's not a recent event that's only my opinion i guess that way i shouldn't talk about that but uh
 		i don't know whether they're recent events i guess they were on this uh speech thing they want us to use a variety of words you know
 	
 	
 		wight
 	
 	
 		how many times have you called by the way i
 	
 	
 		actually i haven't made any calls but i received about a dozen i i think yeah i have to make these but i get distracted and get to do something else and all of a sudden my phone rings and go oh what the heck we'll talk for a while
 	
 	
 		oh really i i
 		yeah i i've already got uh twelve cards you get any cards in the mail you know
 	
 	
 		yeah we got a whole bunch i can't remember how many
 	
 	
 		i don't know i'm amazed by of course we're not talking about politics but i am amazed by people say they got thirty i wonder why you need
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		thirty renditions of the persons voice but i'm not in voice uh synthesis but i'd sure like to see a summary of it we'll get to politics i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		you might be well i think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway we're supposed to do five minutes and that was three minutes ago hey well thanks for the call yeah bye
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		yeah
 		yeah bye-bye
