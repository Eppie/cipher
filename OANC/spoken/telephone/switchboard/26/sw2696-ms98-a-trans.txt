 
     		
 	
 		okay
 		do you exercise every night or not
 	
 	
 		no i do it in spurts
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yes and i've i should do it on a regular basis but uh for some reason i think it's tough to get into a a particular routine
 	
 	
 		yeah i i'm on uh a right now i'm on one of those jags where i i exercise at well i i run every night
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i just i was surprised i could run i didn't think i could i thought well i maybe a half a block i can run but i have really amazed myself but what i do i walk oh about a half a mile and i walk uphill
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then i run all the way back down by the time i get down to my street i've worked up a pretty good momentum and i can just keep right on running until i get home
 		and uh i'm not right now i just got through doing it so i'm a little bit out of breath i'm really not as winded as i would thought thought i was going to be
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh a very appropriate topic then
 	
 	
 		yes sure it was fantastic i think gosh i just got back got in from running and i thought well i'll place this call real quick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i have a little dog i run with so i'm and she's getting old i don't know if i probably not good for her but it's good for me
 	
 	
 		i think it's probably as good for her anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		they're they're natural i do a lot of uh hunting
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		and have a bird dog and i enjoy watching that dog run more than i do anything
 	
 	
 		yeah aren't they pretty i not
 	
 	
 		they are they're just beautiful and the native instinct that they have is just amazing to watch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is it a pointer or
 	
 	
 		it's a setter um-hum
 	
 	
 		setter yeah i think they're the prettiest
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a good combination pet and hunting dog both
 	
 	
 		i had a a Greyhound i was race i was running with but uh
 	
 	
 		oh my you are ambitious
 	
 	
 		he was i found i just i tried uh
 		i finally had to give her back to the Greyhound Association she was just too big for me she she weighed seventy pounds and uh
 		if she would run with me you know and stay with me but if she saw something she wanted if she wanted to get away she could have she would have drug me i mean when i walked with her people you know would laugh because she drug me when i tried to walk
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and when i tried to run i was afraid she'd really take out running and just have and they can run i think uh forty miles an hour and uh gosh uh she got away from me a couple of times and
 		so i'd rather run with a little Pekingese any old day  they're my my more my style
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		are so you just run in your neighborhood
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'm i'm too chicken to get out any place else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i do you belong to a health club
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		no i've i've done some of that and the YMCA and other types of things too uh
 	
 	
 		oh have you
 	
 	
 		i just don't enjoy running i i enjoy walking fast and with hand weights and things like that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh okay well that might be my i have a walking tape i use i bought me a little head set you know and a little walking tape which really helps but but i wanted to run for some reason and you know and i i didn't really think i could
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because i i remember years ago when i tried my side would hurt real bad and everything
 		but i i'm on a health kick i've decided uh my cholesterol was high and my triglyceride's high so i've i've uh done that and i'm on uh
 		i everybody says i don't need to lose weight but i feel i must so i'm going to try to lose ten pounds and i've lost four of it so i'm really
 	
 	
 		oh good
 		yeah running there's no question that running will will get your attention as far as uh weight control but
 	
 	
 		yeah and i do it every night except for i i do volunteer work at the hospital one night a week so i don't do it that night but the other uh six days a week i run
 	
 	
 		hum
 		do you run with anyone
 	
 	
 		no just my dog
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i had a neighbor across the street that was going with me but she can't run because she said her ankles hurt or her knees or something and so i uh what i do i'll walk with her up the top hill and let her take my dog and then i run home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if she's home she's a flight attendant so she's not home very often and so when she's home i run with her but her walk with her but
 	
 	
 		but do you do you have that feeling of boredom sometimes in running or
 	
 	
 		i would if i didn't have this radio on my head
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i think i in fact i haven't been using my walking tape since i've been running i've been using just my radio and if i didn't have that to go but i have to what i do is i have to set goals for myself i say okay i'm going to make it to the end of that block and then when i get there i'm going okay i've got to make i just go a block at a time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if i didn't i i i don't think i could make it and i need feel that running you know three and four mile i don't think i could do it i could you know i a mile is real and it may not even be a mile i'm running it feels it looks like a mile to me but it may not be
 	
 	
 		um well you ought to get in the car and measure it one day
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i think i will this weekend i but i'm almost afraid to i'm afraid that it's  oh all this for nothing you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i could go a little bit further but i just don't you know golly i'm not a spring chicken any more and i don't want to have to
 		my daughter got after me she said now you are taking identification with you and i said no i'm just in the neighborhood she says well mother what if a car should jump the the road and hit you or what if you stumbled and fell and knocked yourself out and they wouldn't know who you were
 	
 	
 		your your daughter is wise we had a
 	
 	
 		i said well she is smart you know
 	
 	
 		we had a friend uh who was jogging and
 		passed out and collapsed and had a heart attack and fell over and they took him to the hospital and it took a while to to find out who he was and where
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah i realized she was right after that so now i uh i carry a little ID with me that shows who i where i live anyway and i put my daughter's telephone number for emergencies so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah you know Nancy i think there are a lot of uh people now who are paying more attention to uh physical fitness and i think it's a good idea yeah i
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 		and i go religiously for a check up every year and uh my triglycerides were three hundred and sixty five now this what makes me mad i'm i i don't eat beef i don't use salt i watch my diet all the time and i uh
 		it was three sixty five it's supposed to be a hundred and fifty my cholesterol was two hundred and thirty five well i've gotten that down to a hundred and ninety and my triglycerides have come down to two seventy three but they told me that it takes about three months for triglycerides to come down so it's coming down and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think this and exercise and really watching your diet does it i've been on that diet that
 		what's that Tommy Lasorda thing uh diet
 	
 	
 		oh uh yeah i know what you um-hum
 	
 	
 		ultra fast ultra slim ultra yeah slim fast that's it i've been doing that and it's not too bad uh i don't need
 	
 	
 		right
 		have you tried niacin
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		have you tried niacin
 	
 	
 		no but i'll tell you what i'm doing i'm doing the uh omega fish fish oil calcium lecithin lecithin
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oat bran
 	
 	
 		uh vitamin B6
 	
 	
 		have you tried oat bran
 	
 	
 		no but i'll that's my next step i'm
 	
 	
 		okay
 		my wife uh
 		went on that on a very strict basis and it really brought everything down um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		did it well they they say that the nurse at works said the uh the fish oil would uh bring it down and the lecithin is supposed to bring your cholesterol down
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so and my doctor really was more concerned with uh my triglycerides but he said well my God Nancy no wonder you you have high triglycerides look how look how your weight's jumped and it jumped seven pounds in one year i'm you'd think i was
 		i'm a a size eight i said that's not fat i know you know logically that is not fat but i do realize i need to to lose some weight but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i think keeping in in physical shape helps the mental shape too
 	
 	
 		oh i do too absolutely and i feel so much better about myself when i you know get into good shape when i lived in Orlando i went to weight watchers and i i went from a size twelve to a size six in three months
 	
 	
 		yeah do you play tennis or golf or anything

 		years ago i used to play tennis but i'm so bad i ended up you know just chasing the ball all the time i'd like to do tennis again but uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah
 		i enjoy that and that and i i think i use that as a phase of of my exercise program yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's good exercise do you exercise uh do you play tennis very often
 	
 	
 		uh when it gets warm yes yes
 	
 	
 		oh do you now see i'll quit running when it gets warm when it gets hot i know there's no way i'll get out in that heat and run or even walk
 	
 	
 		right

 		i'll probably balloon up
 	
 	
 		early morning and late evening
 	
 	
 		yeah it'll it'll have to be well you know
 	
 	
 		early morning is a good time
