 
     		
 	
 		how did you all get tied up with this uh TI system
 	
 	
 		oh did you already dial one
 	
 	
 		yeah i just dial one
 	
 	
 		we're being recorded already
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay uh we're supposed to be discussing our homes
 	
 	
 		yeah but what what uh what did you uh are you with TIer or how did you get tied up with this
 	
 	
 		oh it's a uh long story but uh let's discuss about our homes um  what kind of home do you live in
 	
 	
 		uh i guess a typical home here is without a uh uh basement i guess that's the classical uh
 	
 	
 		raised style
 	
 	
 		yeah uh we have something here we have something here you may not have up there which is a well we we were phasing them out is the wood shingle roof i don't know if you had it when i first got here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh my parents live huh
 		where did you got get there from
 	
 	
 		from New Jersey
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i new you didn't have a Texas accent
 	
 	
 		right no i i'm my accent's gone i've practiced a long time to get rid of it uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the the wood shingle roofs are phasing out here they're very they're good for air-conditioning you know they they
 	
 	
 		i hear you
 	
 	
 		it's you it's very shocking when you look inside the attic and on a dry day
 		and see a hundred little or thousands of little light wholes you know
 	
 	
 		i would imagine so
 	
 	
 		it it's very strange and then when of course when it rains then it then it then it stretches
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and does a pretty good job but uh the the fire hazard has is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh i would imagine
 	
 	
 		phasing that kind of construction out it it's so
 	
 	
 		so what kind of home do you live in
 	
 	
 		oh it's a rent it's a multistorey
 		uh last year uh luckily
 	
 	
 		oh a colonial style two story
 	
 	
 		no colonial is not the word had they use here uh that's
 	
 	
 		multistorey is what they call them
 	
 	
 		a multilevel it's called multilevel
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it it it's not it's not really that typical it's a custom home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i live in Arlington actually this i'm working tonight actually in Dallas uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		at TI here
 	
 	
 		oh you work at TI
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's how you got hooked up to this
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you know you can converse with the person for a while and get to know them before you punch the one you don't have to get started on the conversation right away
 	
 	
 		oh yeah your right your right
 	
 	
 		well anyway um well uh
 	
 	
 		how many calls have you made uh have you
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know several eleven twelve thirteen i guess
 	
 	
 		oh really everyone everyone's higher than i am
 	
 	
 		well i haven't made the calls mostly i've just uh i answered them i live in a two story type colonial here in Maryland
 	
 	
 		yeah that that i heard i know those words from the east when i was there but that they don't use that word here
 	
 	
 		yeah well most the homes here are two story because uh they stack them up since the property is so expensive at least in the Maryland area where i am
 	
 	
 		do you have a basement
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's typical up there to you know
 	
 	
 		yeah well like i say the land here and depending on where you are and how crowded it is the land bays go up and here a little old measly quarter of an acre goes from anywhere from four to five thousand to a hundred and some odd thousand depending on where it is
 	
 	
 		oh yeah no the land is much cheaper here
 	
 	
 		and if you're in a fairly decent subdivision which i guess maybe i'm in a fairly middle-class subdivision then
 		the general trend is to put as much house as you can on a quarter acre it took me a long time to get used to it coming from down south up here
 		big big houses on little bitty postage stamp lots
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh that's the general way they uh
 		they build them here so you get about a twenty two hundred to three thousand square foot home depending on whether you include the basement or not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh on about a quarter of an acre or less about ten thousand square feet
 	
 	
 		yeah the lots aren't very big here either in the Dallas uh Fort Worth area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but the basement there just aren't any basements i don't know of anyone ever even thought of putting a basement in here
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well they use slab foundations or do they use block foundations or the little
 	
 	
 		uh it used to be a pier and beam where they would drill piers and and the first you would have a crawl space underneath your house but that's phased out in the last twenty five years where it's all slab
 	
 	
 		crawl space
 		okay slabs are easier and quicker to pour and lay i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh they they say that the the reason they don't put pier i think it's cheaper like you say but uh the soil does move a lot here and they say that you just couldn't uh
 	
 	
 		uh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		put a basement in the soil but i'd think they just to me i don't know really know why it wouldn't work i think you can put a basement in anywhere it's just not not popular
 	
 	
 		i see what to dig out for it
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		do you have high water tables
 	
 	
 		no no it's not very high some of the water here
 	
 	
 		so it's just a matter they just don't do it
 	
 	
 		yeah this is Dallas there the water's down two thousand feet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well of course down there you probably don't have land as quite as much a premium so you can sprawl a big rancher out
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess it's the style i really don't have an answer here because of the tornado i always thought tornados uh i thought people would build a lot of storm cellars you know or shelters you know but even that is not uh popular at all i don't know i don't know of anyone doing that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't even see it in the newspaper where people advertise that they have storm cellars or anything they just don't have them period
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i understand well uh you say you live in a ranch style house yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's multilevel yeah like my garage i have uh uh a bedroom over
 	
 	
 		well now
 		is it like a split level
 	
 	
 		split level yeah
 	
 	
 		in other words you've got some bedrooms above say a garage area and then the living room dining room area is halfway between both you go down steps to your garage and maybe a family room down there and you go up the steps to your bedroom
 	
 	
 		right
 		right exactly
 		right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		okay that's what they call a split level up here and a split foyer is where all the steps are at the entrance way
 		if you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's a split foyer type and then uh a colonial is where they stack it on top of each other and you pretty well have most of your living space on the first floor like uh
 		a family room or uh you know something like that and the dining room area and a living room and maybe a a kitchen with a possible little eat in area or somethi ng like that
 	
 	
 		what's your typical heating up there in Maryland gas or
 	
 	
 		well uh you  i've been through two or three different things of them first house i came up here had gas heat with electric stove then the second house i owned had gas heat and gas stove and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um even gas water heater whereas my previous home it had electric water heater anyway and then the house i'm in now is all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh electric it even has a heat pump
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		well heat pumps nice up there it would probably work pretty well
 	
 	
 		well heat pumps do work pretty well up here it's taking them a few years to get the bugs out of them but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		they they finally seem to work quite well and i would imagine down where you all live heat pumps will work quite well or maybe down there all you need is just air-conditioning that's all
 	
 	
 		well they should yeah because it's warmer in the winter or you have less of a winter down here of course it's a short winter but it does get down to five degrees uh occasionally
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't really know if heat pumps are that popular yet i guess uh i don't i haven't been that close to it in the newer homes
 	
 	
 		well i would imagine all you need is just air-conditioning
 	
 	
 		yeah we we have heat uh some have air-conditioning units i i i have an all electric house but uh it's fifty fifty there's a lot of gas houses here uh because it's so popular
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's right you're you're in the oil state so i would imagine there's plenty of gas around so that's the way to go for heat
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		people i think probably prefer natural gas for for heating
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh i would too because me i like gas heat i love it
 	
 	
 		i don't i'm an engineer and i don't like the danger of it i've seen too many houses here blowup and i think yeah and i just think
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		when i had i had uh a gas uh
 		uh fireplace you know i had and i saw the way it was constructed yeah it went over my daughter's bedrooms you know over the garage i thought and there's there's just too many fittings in this thing to leak and so i just disconnected i never did hook that sucker up so i just took it out completely
 	
 	
 		uh-huh gas logs
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		although people love gas here but i i'm ultraconservative on safety and i just don't don't want it
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum uh-huh
 		well i don't mind electric heating and and the like it's okay i mean i i like gas heat because it's so nice and warm but when it comes to cooking i cook i just absolute think a gas stove's the best that money can buy
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've heard people
 	
 	
 		you just can't beat cooking on gas
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard people say that i and i
 	
 	
 		that flame man is hard to beat because you can regulate it and i mean you you want to turn the flame down on the stove you turn it down right now you don't have to wait for a cool down time which you have to rely on with uh conventional stove or or a warm-up time i mean it's instantly there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and that kind of response is quite uh quite effective i think for cooking
 	
 	
 		oh yeah no i i've i've known people love it for years and uh but uh we've done without it for twenty years here and and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well i've done without it too but i sure prefer it my wife does too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah no i i haven't i haven't really noticed uh i don't miss it you know with our of course i'm against i'm just i'm one of the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a million people that uh is against uh gas
 	
 	
 		well do your houses down there have porches or are they just pretty much like just a front door and that's it
 	
 	
 		no
 		no there's not much in front there's no sitting out front you know there's no like like in the east when i was young
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of course it goes way back we used to sit out front i had a porch up front but no there's not a porch
 	
 	
 		yeah aren't they nice
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		they're sort of coming back up here in the east
 	
 	
 		i i i wish i had that you know
 	
 	
 		front porches are they're not very big but they're kind of coming back
 	
 	
 		right i i think the old ways in a lot of uh ways should come back uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh but i really love a screened in porch outback man i just eat that up
 	
 	
 		but no the
 		yeah no that there it's not popular here either screens in screen in is not that that's so that's uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well don't you all have mosquitoes down there
 	
 	
 		not like not like you have up there no
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		it's too dry it's so dry that it's uh
 	
 	
 		that's surprising
 	
 	
 		Dallas is super dry
 	
 	
 		hm
 		how far are you guys from the coast down there where uh
 		uh what is it uh
 	
 	
 		uh three hundred miles yeah
 	
 	
 		oh are you that's a pretty good piece then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i didn't know you were that far inland i knew it was a ways but
 	
 	
 		our our weather is like we have a we have a the warm raining season is now is April
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and a little bit of May an then it goes into super dry all summer then you summer with a hurricane season but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		well tell me uh do your homes down there pretty much have garage disposals and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they have everything
 	
 	
 		they do are y'all on septic or y'all have public sewage
 	
 	
 		no public there's essentially no septic not in Dallas Fort Worth though you have it in the out lying areas but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh they use one and two car garages or just one car garages or carports
 	
 	
 		two two
 		no not carports uh it's essentially garages
 	
 	
 		okay so they do go garage because i lived down south for a long time carports were real popular in certain areas where i
 	
 	
 		yeah not Dallas uh Fort Worth is you know the two car garage and certainly all air-conditioned uh
 	
 	
 		used to live
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh uh two thousand square feet is probably i don't know if that's average or not
 	
 	
 		about how much floor space
 		yeah that sounds about average i think all over the country
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i i think so too there's a lot of swimming pools here i don't have one uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really i don't either i hate to clean the rascals i had a i had a pool outback behind my previous house one of those
