 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um
 		i guess what i guess my
 		my task  i usually ride my bike i have uh a stationary bike and uh a regular bike and
 		when i can i like to ride my regular bike outside because it's so much nicer  the stationary bike is is so um
 	
 	
 		boring
 	
 	
 		boring  but i have head phones and i plus i have it uh in the living room so i either watch TV or
 		we have a fish tank so i watch the fish you know  whatever i can do to keep myself occupied
 		if i like to have the TV on because that usually keeps me um more occupied it kind of takes the time away and i don't realize really
 		that's really the only time i ever watch TV is when i'm on the bike but
 		and then usually after i'm done riding the bike just to cool myself down i usually take a walk you know and that just kind of gets myself uh gets me you know
 		to where i'm not quite as tired i guess  but it's definitely a task i can't say that i really enjoy it  i wish that i did enjoy it more but i do it because i have to not because i want to
 	
 	
 		you think so
 		i bought a stationary bike
 		but i find that if i sit  on that seat too long it hurts
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i haven't figured how to get that soft and i tried even tying a pillow to it
 		but two years ago i joined well it's not quite two years it's almost two years i joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i love it i just love it
 	
 	
 		really
 		so is it just women that go there
 	
 	
 		yeah it's totally women
 	
 	
 		see i think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place uh a a health club because
 		i don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise  you know so i have tried to just do stuff at home
 		and uh i just feel conscious about it i mean i'm not big you know or anything but i still don't like other people watching  me you know
 	
 	
 		i like to be able to sweat have my hair a mess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		feel that okay fine if my bathing suit slips a little bit i don't have to be conscious of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		of it being a little bit too low and i my bathing suit's just one piece so there's no big deal all the way around but i don't have to be conscious of what i'm doing or how i'm doing it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's uh oh it's just i don't know it's a it's a total free relaxation because hey you can do what you want you're a female and
 		no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing
 	
 	
 		that's what
 	
 	
 		and they've got such fantastic equipment in there
 	
 	
 		really that's that's great how
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		and i love the water aerobics i love the water aerobics
 	
 	
 		do they have a pool or what is
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they've got a nice one
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they have two types of water aerobics they call it aqua exercise i guess is what they call it
 	
 	
 		i've heard that that's really good for you to do
 	
 	
 		it pushes you because you're pushing against the water in itself so it is like double strenuous but you're not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		being double strenuous on your own body because you're pushing it yourself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so you're doing it yourself but
 	
 	
 		so you don't really feel like you're really working that hard do you when you're in the water
 	
 	
 		huh-uh the only thing that i ever felt was
 		every time i stop and start going again because i end up getting two jobs once in a while i end up having to quit for a while but i get blisters on my toes on the bottom because i really jump a lot
 	
 	
 		oh wow  well that's funny i never would have thought of that
 	
 	
 		but
 		well a lot of people wear those little uh terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom
 		especially around the pool so they just wear them right into the pool
 	
 	
 		like water are they water shoes is that
 	
 	
 		yeah they're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber you know soles so that you know no big deal one way or the other
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay
 		okay okay
 		huh that's really funny
 	
 	
 		but i never think about it until after you go there for about a week  your toes you start getting blisters anyway so no big deal
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but it's fun
 	
 	
 		that's
 		so how often do find yourself going um on a if you're doing it on a regular basis how often do you go
 	
 	
 		i try to make it at least three times a week
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really
 	
 	
 		for a while i was doing it every day just
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		going uh five days a week
 	
 	
 		i wish that i could make myself exercise every day but i do force myself to do it at least three times a week which i don't feel like is enough but
 		uh it's it's at least something  you know it it i just force i have to force myself to do it like i said because to me i really don't enjoy it but i know that i have to do it i mean it's just
 		it's it's not a question of whether i want  to you know
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		when i was working up at uh The Summit here in Plano i'd leave there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 	
 	
 		oh actually about four thirty because they start at five to six so i was there by four thirty every night
 		and the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because no matter what i did or how i did it i invariably got myself wet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the water only comes up basically to your
 		anywhere from your waist to your oh chest i'd say
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i mean it's your choice where you want to go but
 	
 	
 		did you ever
 	
 	
 		i enjoyed it higher
 	
 	
 		well i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for TI
 	
 	
 		i have a i have a bad back
 	
 	
 		did you ever try that
 	
 	
 		so i'm very limited what i do
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		it's like i can walk
 		but if i walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard it will bother me it will bother me
 	
 	
 		then that would yeah i guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you wouldn't it
 	
 	
 		well that what pushed me that way though was basically was the fact that when i w ent in there is wasn't for the water aerobics i went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh she said hey go for the swimming pool she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor she says in fact you get more
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		i said okay because i'm not a swimmer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i like water i'm not scared of it but i couldn't i guess i could swim across the pool but i'm no swimmer per se
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i found that this worked really well and i came out of there and i saw my stomach going down well
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i dropped oh i'd say almost twenty pounds
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		just by watching what i ate and they fix you up with a diet which worked real good
 	
 	
 		what if you're already on one i mean yeah i mean when you go in there they wouldn't make you do theirs would they
 	
 	
 		what a diet
 		oh no they have nothing to do with that
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		see i joined uh when this
 		one down here opened up i joined as a VIP and the VIP gives you uh
 		oh  gives you a diet a computerized diet and they go over all your health and all your history and they show you how everything to do and how to do it and the whole nine yards
 		so it became part of the package so i went through it
 	
 	
 		but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program is that what you're saying
 	
 	
 		it worked out well
 		oh yeah you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too
 	
 	
 		i see okay
 	
 	
 		i just went and took the because they were offering it as an opening benefit so it was
 		it's less than what you pay now for going in there after all this time
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		after all this time so it's like when i got laid off i went back in there and start all over again because it had been a while since i'd done it
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i get all the same treatment again so it's kind of nice
 	
 	
 		wow that's
 	
 	
 		like i said i like it i like the heat i like the
 		i jump out of the swimming pool and i go into the hot tub
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i love it
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be really nice
 	
 	
 		because i have never i have never let me reword that i think i have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore
 		but that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's i knew i was pushing too far
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but usually when i go into the hot tub before i go swimming or when i come out i'm totally relaxed when i go home it's no big deal
 	
 	
 		so you really do enjoy your exercise then since your
 	
 	
 		it's fun it's fun
 		uh i've gotten on the bike and they've got uh the stepping bike where you step
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i've enjoyed that watching how well i can
 		can walk up and down stairs
 	
 	
 		that's you know i wanted
 	
 	
 		but most of the others to me are very dull
 	
 	
 		i wanted to get one of those steppers when i bought the bike but i got talked into the bike instead and
 		i don't know
 		i really wanted a stepper i'm considering maybe even buying one of those too but i'm not sure if i'll get benefit out of both of them i mean i don't know if it would really do any good having both of them
 		which one do you feel is better since you use them both
 	
 	
 		um
 		i get bored very easily
 		uh the one nice thing about the bicycle
 		is you just sit like you said you can sit and do it and watch the TV and not even really be conscious of what you are doing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		with the stepper you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so you have a little you know little you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to what your gear is
 		uh i it would depend upon which one you want i think now that i've had the bicycle
 		i would go to the stepper
 		but if i were you i would go apply to either a health club or one of the others
 		and use it for a while because you can buy a month's membership and see what you feel is best for you
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		um
 	
 	
 		because it all depends you know for everyone their own what they want to do
 		because i jump on the bike here at home
 		mine has its see the handle bars go up and down so i can sit there and read and listen to music like what you said and it has no effect on me
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		so i mean it's
 		boring
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
