 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		um  one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public education because i went through the public um school system of Boston and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i always felt
 		that i graduated high school and i still didn't even i i i couldn't put together a map of the United States
 	
 	
 		hm uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know what i mean and yet i felt that i got a good education and and i did well in school but you tell me to name you know
 		five continents and i couldn't do it  i just feel like there are some real basics that are missing from education
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and that people are are leaving school  not even knowing some common sense things
 	
 	
 		yeah when uh well talking about public education um
 		i was just just i'm we're doing a proposal at we're doing at NC State
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that's kind of at a higher level
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so it's interesting that you chose that topic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um did you go through a a public school system or a private
 	
 	
 		yeah well i went through private until ninth grade
 	
 	
 		um-hum  did you notice a big difference
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah big difference
 	
 	
 		like in what sense
 	
 	
 		well um
 		in uh public schools i guess
 		there were there are a lot of you know people can take lower level courses and get away with learning nothing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um in private school you couldn't do that you know you had to learn
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		i work in a temporary agency and there are people that come in you know everyday to fill out an application and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they'll have to bring somebody with them and they will show that they completed um four years of high school yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves
 	
 	
 		it's bad
 	
 	
 		it's just incredible
 	
 	
 		yeah our state just cut a whole bunch of uh like
 		think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		so we're making all kinds of cuts in college
 		people cannot i mean the teachers can't make tests anymore and the the library's canceling all it's subscription
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's pretty sorry
 	
 	
 		i know um they uh i forget what i think it's um
 		someplace in New York
 		because they're having budget problems they're closing the libraries
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		or  anything like that they're not cutting in any other corner they're closing the libraries that to me shows a little uh switch in priorities you know
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so do you go to college right now are you in
 	
 	
 		yeah it's my last year
 	
 	
 		you're so you're a senior now
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm working on my projects trying to
 		graduate
 	
 	
 		oh good for you that's great um is is NC University is that uh uh state what'd you say
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		NC State
 		NC State
 	
 	
 		NC State that's a state university then i see  and you're from there also
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well yeah i was uh
 		i was born in Raleigh and then i lived in Winston-Salem rest of my life
 	
 	
 		um-hum i see
 	
 	
 		so now i'm back here  going to school
 	
 	
 		well pretty soon it's gonna get to the point where no one's gonna be able to afford to send their kids to college or to go to college
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just outrageously expensive
 	
 	
 		luckily State's the cheap one of the cheap ones
 	
 	
 		oh is it well still though i mean you know thousands of dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah state's not that bad
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh well that's good that's good i went to a private university and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i don't know i look back now and i i think that i probably would've done it differently if i um you know could do it over again but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or
 		didn't even go to school some some of them and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i really do and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say but um i don't know i i what
 	
 	
 		yeah where'd you go
 		where did you go sorry
 	
 	
 		i went to Brandeis University it's in Massachusetts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i i really felt like i've been working now for about four years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i i feel like what what i've learned working is a hundred times more valuable than what i learned in school
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i know that i'm drawing a lot on what i learned in school you know i i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on on learned but um
 		i don't know my sister's a principal at a school and one thing that she's trying to instill in kids um besides just reading and writing
 		um are just some the golden rules she calls them just some basics about um  you know you don't take what's not yours
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh and and if you want to you know you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission like no hitting you know no pulling hair or anything like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh the school that she's in is a um  it's basically for minorities um there's uh a large minority population and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		she's really noticed that
 		even some of the teachers that work there i think they don't value that type of student as much as you get in some
 	
 	
 		yeah that's sorry that that that they like pick on you know that the advanced stud ents and pay more attention to them ignore the others
 	
 	
 		yeah it's true um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't know if it makes them feel better i mean do teachers get i mean personally i would get more satisfaction out of taking somebody that wasn't as successful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and seeing what they could do versus somebody that you know did excel in in areas and just watching them get better you know that's not much of a challenge
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		but
 		are do you have any idea what you're gonna go into when you graduate
 	
 	
 		um graduate school  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		do you know where yo u're going
 	
 	
 		i think i'm going to Chapel Hill
 	
 	
 		where's that
 	
 	
 		that's in Chapel Hill  that's the name yeah never heard of the Tarheels
 	
 	
 		oh is that North Carolina oh okay
 		no i don't know that area
 	
 	
 		the ACC Tarheels UNC
 	
 	
 		i don't know it
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		i don't get down there very often
 	
 	
 		they were in the final four don't watch basketball
 	
 	
 		oh really well the way i pick the final four was um by the the state that had the warmest climate
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's how i chose all mine so you can tell that i didn't really have
 		that much to do with any of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but so obviously you're into education if you can be going my husband went to is in graduate school actually right now
