 
     		
 	
 		all right you want to start out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it'll be real easy for us because we're both my husband and i are vegetarians so yeah so that's the first thing we look for is if we can eat there or not
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh are you really
 		oh
 		are you strict vegetarians
 	
 	
 		we're not vegan vegetarians we do we're ovolacto we do eat uh eggs and and milk products i used to be a complete vegan vegetarian where i didn't eat any animal products at all
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um it was it's really difficult in the area if you don't have you know the products that you can get and if you go out to dinner there's virtually you know there's not a whole lot of things you can get
 	
 	
 		there's very few places that you i'll bet that you could uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i think maybe if you were somewhere like California where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff but here basically you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant you know where you can get foods that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn meal you know or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah and you wouldn't have the meat products in that and some
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah yeah you have to watch that too all you know some of the restaurants here they will you know like you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use like lard or you know animal fat to cook with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so but so that's that we don't really eat out too much we we tend to eat at home and actually you know i think we we we get a have we have a healthier diet than the average person
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh how long have you been doing  this
 	
 	
 		um i've been a vegetarian for uh two years now my husband has been one for oh just over a year now and uh so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you feel that it has improved the way you feel
 	
 	
 		definitely and it it makes you more aware of what you're eating because you you have to be i mean you you  i think you
 	
 	
 		you think
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you you balance the foods uh you know you're more aware of what nutrient you know value each thing has and minerals and you're just more aware of food for energy for energy sake
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i always thought it would be be hard to figure out what to eat if you were a vegetarian how how
 	
 	
 		well that's just it you you do have to figure it out and and you know to get proteins and things and when i was a vegan it's you know you have to consider calcium and iron and things like that you you're not even getting through your milk products your egg products
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		because you don't eat any of those things
 	
 	
 		if you don't eat any of those but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables i mean there are  there are there are you actually you can get more calcium through
 		leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products a lot of people don't know that well the thing is that milk products our bodies don't uh
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		don't uh the the lactose that kind of milk it doesn't our we we tend to uh what's it called we don't synthesize the the calcium the same way
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		we throw more of it off our body out other words
 	
 	
 		yeah we we slough some of it we we send we send some of it out because it our body doesn't accept some of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we're not utilizing we're when it when it gets rid of some of that um that we can't use it get rids it gets rid of some of the calcium
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		whereas we eat say broccoli you utilize all of it you utilize your your body accepts all of the broccoli
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		all that's in it
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's like it's like say a person using vitamins as opposed to uh vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food
 	
 	
 		why
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		your body just doesn't accept vitamins and the minerals in the the vitamins in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh supplements that it does in regular food you know so but we both we both feel much healthier much healthier and i couldn't consider going back to eating
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 		uh-huh
 		after you have been on this
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well now i changed for ethical reasons and my husband
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		has changed he feels more ethically about it but he
 		he in the beginning began for health reasons
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um
 		now he he feels like i do that
 		he looks at the things that he eats and he realizes what they are before he eats them and he you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		he thinks more about them then
 	
 	
 		yeah plus he eats we both think more about i thought more of about it as far as what it was i was eating
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know as far as a living creature and now we both think a lot of well what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our bodies too so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum so you kind of have a combination
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh now see we i live in a farming community
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so of course we have a lot of animals and that type of thing raised in our area
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we do too i mean i was raised in um we're in cattle country and people here buy a half a cow and put it in their freezer you know and that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		that's the way i and i believe you me it wasn't easy to give up to give up a hamburger that that was one of my favorite foods was was a was a good steak or a hamburger but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know i suppose if you really believe in something it's
 		you you adjust your life because your mind you your you inside yourself you just it's not right
 	
 	
 		you get adjusted to the taste
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining area than what most
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		most people would
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now we wouldn't have that problem  because we're not vegetarians
 	
 	
 		so what do you look for when you
 	
 	
 		uh i think the main thing that i look for is uh cleanliness
 		uh you know the in the appearance of the people that work there and the uh quality of the food that they serve
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you normally when you're traveling do you look for places that's established that that you've been to before or are you willing to try new places
 	
 	
 		if
 		oh we try new places but when we a lot of times we do eat where we know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah like a chain restaurant or something
 	
 	
 		what
 		um-hum
 		what the quality because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh we do do that a lot
 		and i guess i'm getting old older  also i like to be served  i like to sit down and have my uh
 		order taken
 	
 	
 		as opposed to like a cafeteria kind of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		situation yeah
 	
 	
 		so i suppose you'd say i well i i don't know whether it's age or what it is but i have
 	
 	
 		well no i don't think so i think it's just your because i i prefer to be waited on too i just if you're going to go out to eat why not have the whole service you know why why not get the whole
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess because we don't go out that much i feel like it's a treat
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you should feel have a treat and i like the light meals not all restaurants have light meals on their menu
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and i
 	
 	
 		oh light menu you mean like cooked light or
 	
 	
 		uh L I T E like uh uh things that aren't as heavy a meal
 	
 	
 		oh i see uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it
 		that you get more uh fruit and
 		maybe cottage cheese or a chicken breast or things that aren't as uh
 		they're not breaded and they're not fried and they're not
 	
 	
 		not a lot of gravy and things like that you know i i like those too i like those too because uh some seems like sometimes it's
 	
 	
 		yeah uh but not all restaurants
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you order a meal you order their dinner meal and it's like they're trying to find out how much you can eat or or
 	
 	
 		i know it's too much yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		or or like evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain and maybe they're afraid that people are going to complain or something i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i don't know what it is but
 		now for instance we we had a Scout dinner last night we went to and it's it's they
 		uh well they'll serve you at your seat and usually usually the salad bar is included so you have to get up for that but
 		they have so much food
 		that you not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself you end up eating
 		much more than you need
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and i think that's a shame i mean i must admit sometimes i do like a buffet but uh but i think that they just tend to make you you say oh well i've have got all i can eat or or you know it's one of these situations where
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		nobody's going to restrain what you eat the amount that you eat and i think that people that we just tend to eat overeat yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh-huh
 		yeah you can eat as much as you want and you like the food you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh a lot of times the foods like uh Haas's carry a bread bar that is just out of this world  and you know you and soup and uh they just and fruit and vegetables and they they just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know that you i know i always overeat no matter i go with good intentions
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i somehow along the way when i come back to my seat i have too much  and i eat it  because it's so good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well at least it's fruit and stuff there maybe it's not too bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		and i like reasonable prices of course too i don't like to
 		you know go to anything that's real expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that's a waste of my money
 	
 	
 		just for food it does seem like it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but uh we like uh we do like international food so we tend to i like cooking we like Indian food and uh i love Italian food and
 	
 	
 		so
 		do you
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh Chinese uh
 	
 	
 		Chinese
 		we've got a good Chinese restaurant in town i i really like eating there and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you don't get stuffed on their food it seems
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you can eat a whole big plate of their food and
 		you really don't feel like you've eaten too much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you're full you know you're satisfied
 		but you don't feel stuffed and miserable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's one thing that i wish we had more of uh because where we're from it's it's pretty limited and it's most of the restaurants are
 		oh they tend to be you know American style food and we don't have too many where you have to go all the way to Dallas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		and so really is a treat because uh you know we don't make a trip sixty five eighty you know sixty five to eighty miles depending how far in Dallas it is
 	
 	
 		so yeah
 		yeah
