 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay Jerry uh  could you tell me what what type of a house you have
 	
 	
 		well at the moment i have a little vacation house back in the woods and it's brick and it has it's pine paneled
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and it's a vacation home
 	
 	
 		well kind of because it's temporary
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		okay and it but if you know if you want to talk about other kinds of homes my husband uh son is a builder
 		in Oklahoma City and he was visiting a couple of weeks ago so we went around to see all uh the homes that how they build homes in Charlotte
 	
 	
 		okay so  are you new to are you're new to Charlotte
 	
 	
 		what kind of materials they use
 		
 
 		kind of originally from this area uh from Virginia uh area but yeah
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but moved here from Oklahoma City
 	
 	
 		originally from Oklahoma City
 	
 	
 		well no but we spent twenty years in Oklahoma we're a mobile society
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		wow twenty years is a long time
 	
 	
 		yes it is to love it
 	
 	
 		um
 		so yours is your home right now is typical of the ones that are in the area
 	
 	
 		well in the immediate area because we're in the county with the uh
 		uh farmers kind of farmers they're about you know around ninety already eighty nine or ninety but their children have grown up and they have built then more contemporary
 		are more uh uh kind  some ostentatious homes
 	
 	
 		huh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh but all traditional they're they're uh they're some are contemporary contemporary but mostly traditional
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah oh
 	
 	
 		how about your home
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		are you interested in uh
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's a salt box that's a it's a it's a New England
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		type
 		uh i was born and brought up in the area that that i lived in and it was very rural and there was nothing there but uh
 		
 
 		uh farms
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh or orchards one or the other you know there was a lot of apple orchards so when we decided to build we built
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		about thirteen years ago uh we looked for a home and the things that we were seeing were
 		uh not up to my standards they were still building homes back then like they have for
 		a hundred and fifty years you know the very little insulation in the walls and very little insulation in the ceiling so
 	
 	
 		yes um-hum
 		that doesn't work these days
 	
 	
 		yeah and it was uh
 		it wasn't what we wanted so we did some research and i knew the land there's a lot of ledge up here so you have to be careful
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh their septic systems when there's no uh uh public sewer system
 		there is water however so we picked out a piece of land that we liked and bought it and then we decided to build so we we did a lot of research like i said and we
 		and we built a typical New England salt box in the area and when we built we were the first home there there was like about
 		ten acres of oak forest around us
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		and it was absolutely gorgeous uh since then however they've torn it all down and we're surrounded by homes you know that's a that's another long story
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but we're the only typical New England home in the area there's a lot of there's an English Tudor right next to us and there's uh there's a colonial our street's on just a short street there's only like six homes on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there's a uh an English colonial down on the corner and the rest are raised ranches and you know the typical uh home
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but we built ours um  we made uh we did it ourselves uh i sent uh uh
 		some rough plans out to an architect to have him draw it up and then i subbed out the things that i couldn't do like i had a crew come in and frame it and i did the rest i did the inside the wiring the plumbing and uh you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		so we built the walls huh
 	
 	
 		you are multitalented
 		you are multitalented
 	
 	
 		uh my dad had built a couple when we were growing up so kind of got used to it and we did a lot of research
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 		sure well if you were to do it uh again today what would you have done differently
 		name things say
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 		we made the kitchen a working kitchen i think i would've made the kitchen uh a lot bigger because both of us like to cook
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and right now a working kitchen is very efficient but
 		two people kind of get in each other's way yeah it's similar to a galley kitchen yeah and then we have uh a like a little dining area off that we have a formal dining room
 	
 	
 		is that like a galley kitchen
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i've since added onto the house we've got like uh uh looks like an old rustic uh log cabin on the inside
 		uh it's all natural wood the ceiling's pine the walls are pine you know it's uh one of those type kick around rooms
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we put a greenhouse on it it was uh designed to be heated by the sun
 	
 	
 		yes how does that work in the winter
 	
 	
 		um it works fine as long as you don't put any plants in it
 	
 	
 		exactly it burns it up i'm a plant uh former plant person and uh business uh-huh so uh you know
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh are you
 		oh
 		we raise orchids
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		which is a little bit tough to do up here in the north but it's a solar greenhouse we put up you know like the walls are six inches thick
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well do you not have shade cloths and so forth and
 		uh-huh well
 	
 	
 		no no we used uh fiberglass we're faced the the greenhouse faces solar south
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's it's double glazed fiberglass with a one inch airspace in between it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of opaque we don't use shading on it um  but we do have to uh have air a lot of air movement even in the wintertime it can get uh brutally hot in there
 		so the way it was designed was to uh
 		uh i put a four foot foundation under it and put in twenty two ton of rock with with uh hot air piped through it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and all day long it just heats up and then at night it just gives it back into the house
 	
 	
 		well great great
 	
 	
 		so it's it's not bad it's it's uh
 		i'd like a little bit warm land i'd like to go up further north and i'd like to instead of having a salt box i'd like to have it all on on one floor
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well come south and uh you will already you will be watching the azaleas bloom and go they are just about gone this time of the year
 	
 	
 		that's right  you guys must yeah because the actually the winter hasn't been really bad
 	
 	
 		we're all
 		no huh-uh everything's green all the leaves are out and all that
 		so it's pret ty
 	
 	
 		so you got your garden planted
 	
 	
 		my spinach
 	
 	
 		yeah sir
 		it's it's probably gotten just a little bit too warm now we have trouble up here with uh uh
 	
 	
 		really
 		well for not summer crops summer crops it's uh it's really not time to plant okra not quite the ground isn't warm enough but uh
 		some of those
 	
 	
 		yeah no i uh i put down black plastic
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to help heat it up you know put it on the radishes and spinach but spinach kind of bolts quick on us so we put it Swiss chard instead yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah right get that out early um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so anyhow that's what we've done for our house we've left it all natural so there's no upkeep you know it's white cedar shingle
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 	
 	
 		and the trim is stained so i don't have to go out and scrape and paint
 		because i figured when i got old and retire i don't want to be working i don't be a slave to the home
 	
 	
 		no no you don't want to be on ladders do you
 		you don't want to be on a ladder
 	
 	
 		um right right because that peek is twenty eight feet high and you come off twenty eight feet and it hurts so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well it certainly has been enjoyable talking to you this morning and uh hope to hear from you again sometime if they do that
 	
 	
 		yes you too
 		okay yeah all right you take care okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		good-bye thank you
