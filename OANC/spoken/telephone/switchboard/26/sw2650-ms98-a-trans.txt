 
     		
 	
 		okay this is really ironic that this would
 		i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away  and it's just
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		been tearing me up all day  because we have just been looking all over for him we've been to the pound we've been to the humane society we've been to the adoption
 	
 	
 		oh i bet
 	
 	
 		center we've just been all over the neighborhood we've been calling neighbors so this is just really strange  that
 	
 	
 		oh i guess so have you lost him before
 	
 	
 		no this is the first time um he's gotten out before but he's always stayed right here you know he's never gone away and so this is just really strange you know because um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		what kind of a dog is he
 	
 	
 		he's part golden lab and part uh let's see Alaskan no not Alaskan i always forget  uh Australian shepherd
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh boy he's a big one then huh
 	
 	
 		and yeah he's pretty big that's why it it really surprises me you know that
 		he hasn't come back because like i said he's never gone away like this before and
 		i would think you know he might i mean he might could get hurt by a car or something i don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big you know but i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah oh well i i hope he comes back that's too bad how long have you had him
 	
 	
 		thanks i do too
 		oh about two years so he's yeah it's really gosh
 	
 	
 		oh that's tough
 		yeah you get very attached to animals don't you
 	
 	
 		that isn't that funny how we do i mean we just really
 	
 	
 		yes well you know they're always there for you and they don't talk back to you and uh  it's kind of pleasant yeah sure sure
 	
 	
 		yeah well they're companions you know they're really well do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		yes we have a little a dog a little white Lhasa
 		and her name is Angel and we have a cat who a white cat he's he's just a Tabby just a and his name is Dominique we call him Neek but
 	
 	
 		um  how do they get along together
 	
 	
 		pretty good uh we've we had the the dog first and um
 		she's kind of a wimp and and the cat kind of rules but uh uh she she likes him all right he we had another cat uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		about two years ago it got leukemia feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep and uh then we got this new cat so i
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i have two children and they really enjoy the animals and then my mother who is very elderly lives with us and she's really good friends with the dog they're very good buddies
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's what are so neat about animals i mean they are you know like i said they're they're really companions you know and they're friends you know i mean they
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		you can love them all you want and they love you right back and they don't yeah no  i know it's just so neat you know it's
 	
 	
 		that's right they don't care what you look like or what you act like they just love you unconditionally it's wonderful
 	
 	
 		that's i don't know  this is just so hard   it's just like i said we've had him for two years and he's never i mean he's he's gotten out
 	
 	
 		it's oh i know it has to be
 	
 	
 		but he's always been right there he's never been gone from at all you know he's just always been right there when he gets out you know it's the first time he's ever been gone like this
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		oh
 		yeah
 		oh that's really too bad that's awful well
 	
 	
 		uh i i just knew today uh you know we looked at the pound and
 		and that we just went all over the place and i knew we were going to find him you know and when we didn't it was like oh no  so i don't know
 	
 	
 		well i i'll i hope you'll find him you most likely will
 	
 	
 		yeah we keep you know they they told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center you know don't give up hope you know and then
 	
 	
 		well have you put any posters up or anything like that
 	
 	
 		well not yet we were talking about that tonight since you know he we just he just got out yesterday we were just talking about that whether we
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we were trying to find some pictures of him recently we've got so many when he was a puppy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know but we just don't have a whole lot we have him on film you know on the video camera  you know but you can't put that on the  you know so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum yeah
 		no you sure can't oh dear
 	
 	
 		so i don't know i we will probably will put some things up some posters and stuff up
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		and hopefully that will help you know and maybe around the neighborhood but we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood so that helps too you know if they can keep yeah
 	
 	
 		they can keep their eyes open yeah that will help well
 	
 	
 		so i think that if somebody else picks him up i think that uh if he gets out he'll come back you know i really do because he knows exactly where he lives so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah he will i bet he does i know that it's hard on you i know that i'd be worried too
 	
 	
 		nope
 		i know it's just like i said it's just so ironic that this would happen you know and i would get this this kind of a call  yeah it just i know it's really strange but
 	
 	
 		yeah isn't it though that is that's
 		yeah i know sometimes our cat will will stay out all night and
 		when he's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something's happened to him that somebody he's got in a fight or you know somebody's hit him and and uh and if he doesn't come by mid morning then i really get scared but he's always come back eventually so
 	
 	
 		well that's good that's one thing about cats though they're so small and you know they can get hurt a lot easier you know and then so that would make you really tend to worry about them you know if they're not right there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they can
 		yeah
 		yeah well but he's a real feisty guy he fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property it's
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		he's cats are really almost
 		more territorial than than dogs are they just really do not want other animals on their property they're very very he he just any cat that comes near and even a dog he won't he won't
 		jump at them or anything but he'll sit and he'll watch and it and he i think maybe he would if it came real close but he's very protective of our property
 	
 	
 		huh that's really i i guess i really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them so i never had them growing up so you know i never really had them around me you know so i've never owned one  you know but
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh yeah
 		well they're uh really a lot different than dogs because they're not they're very independent and
 		uh they're very he's he's very affectionate when he wants to be but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be he'll just he'll you know either scratch you or or run away um but when he wants to be
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh he's really affectionate he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and
 		and and snuggle up to you and but if he's not in the mood you'd better stay away from him so but dogs seem to be always in the mood they're always you know right there and like like you to pet them and loving and so
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah that's true i i like the way they come up and they'll
 		they'll put their head underneath your hand you know it's that uh and most dogs do that i mean i don't know any that really don't i mean you know they know exactly how to get that attention you know they just
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah oh
 		yeah they do
 		hm
 		they sure do
 	
 	
 		you know come up and they put your you know  or they'll rub their their head against you you know and it's it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		is now do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outside
 	
 	
 		well no well well he's outside during the day and then when we get home at night we do bring him in
 	
 	
 		and you have a fenced yard or uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh yeah the backyard it's real big too for him to run in and stuff that's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out  you know because he got all this room to run in and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well how did he get out
 	
 	
 		but
 		he dug a hole under the fence well see he did he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole and you know we we filled it back up
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		put him back in there he did it again  so we chained him up you know but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because you know we feel like that's just too restricting for him so um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right right
 	
 	
 		we got we we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it
 		you know so that he couldn't get out well he kind of ripped through the chicken wire so i can't i i i just have not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't understand you know because it's like uh he's got a good home you know he's got i mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot you know it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out you know we just couldn't
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well you know that animals are like that they like to roam and investigate and
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess that's yeah i guess that's probably true i don't think it's anything we did  least i would hope not no i i know i mean he's always you know he really does have a good home i think that's what really
 	
 	
 		and see what's going on
 		no no i'm sure that yeah
 	
 	
 		bothers me the most about it you know it's like
 	
 	
 		yeah how are your kids handling it
 	
 	
 		well
 		i don't know if it's really quite hit him hit them  uh i have two girls and they they just been real um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know at first you know they seemed to be upset but now it's like um
 		well if he doesn't come home can we get another dog it's like wait a minute you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yes that sounds like kids  uh-huh  oh
 	
 	
 		poor Buddy you know i said he's only been gone a day and you already want to replace him  Buddy um-hum
 	
 	
 		what's his name did you call Buddy  we that's what's our cat's name that that that died oh yeah we named him uh uh we named him Buddy after uh Buddy Bell uh uh
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		the Ranger baseball player that used to be here  and we used to we were really into that when we got him
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		going to the Ranger games and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason but Buddy after Buddy Bell so but he was he was a good cat too we miss him a lot and i feel feel i feel real guilty because
 	
 	
 		that's funny
 		yeah it just
 	
 	
 		we had him like for six years and one year i forgot to get his leukemia booster and he got it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i just felt so bad i it's real contagious and it's and the vet said it runs rampant in this area and if they don't have their booster
 	
 	
 		i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		any kind of saliva or anything from another cat if they get in a fight it automatically like they get it if the other cat has it so
 	
 	
 		i had no i had no idea i did not know that
 	
 	
 		oh oh it was terrible i just felt terrible and i knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was he was just real getting real skinny
