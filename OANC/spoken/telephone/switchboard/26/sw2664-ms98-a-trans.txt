 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's about this rap crap
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh  yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it uh uh do you get it
 	
 	
 		um not really
 		not really i've uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i uh i've
 		i'm forty years old now so i've  uh
 	
 	
 		oh so am i so we're talking the same language
 	
 	
 		yeah we uh we we grew up with the same music and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just uh i heard song i heard uh what they call around here they have a thing they call uh  oh what are they uh it's a spoof on the song and the song was um
 		you you've heard of the song Dance to the Music you remember that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		okay well they did a uh a uh twisted tune they call it and the twisted tune was Rap Isn't Music
 	
 	
 		yeah indeed
 	
 	
 		and they they sang here Rap Isn't Music  to the tune of you know Dance to the Music  it was pretty funny
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		
 
 		and to the music
 		wow that's terrific
 		well i just don't get you know like i remember when we were growing up how you know the Beatles and and and and and Presley uh you know how they were all condemned and rock and roll was the devil's music and it wouldn't last and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i you know i keep thinking that you know i i uh uh uh are are we doing the same thing with this rap stuff
 	
 	
 		i'm
 	
 	
 		i mean at at at least with rock and roll it took talent
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true now if you can just uh make a rhyme and sometimes not even a good one you know you
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you know all you got to do  is is you know i it just amazes me
 	
 	
 		and you don't even need a band because you can just use that uh crazy little radio to uh keep the time for you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes a scratchy record you know
 	
 	
 		oh God yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i
 		i mean i i can tolerate a lot of different things and i can you know i can tolerate a certain amount of of rap but if i have to listen to two songs in a row i'm ready to shoot somebody
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah really
 		it's it it it i i just don't get it course i guess that dates us it means you are forty
 	
 	
 		yeah that that must be it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um my i get a real kick out of the uh these remakes of the old songs that we grew up with
 	
 	
 		oh yeah now that that i do enjoy i do uh yeah you know and i've been hearing a lot lot more of it lately too
 	
 	
 		yeah it makes you think that all the uh singer song writers are running out of
 		you know things to write about
 	
 	
 		well
 		you know you know uh uh i know that somewhere you know i mean we we were really fortunate because you know we we had a you know the times of the Beatles and
 		and and and things like that i mean you know that music is i really think the Beatles music will probably last you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah it it it they're immortal but uh
 		i i just really don't know if uh what is it RBQ or whatever that  i i don't even know run run run run run something uh
 	
 	
 		run D
 	
 	
 		Run DMC yes Run D i mean uh uh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it'll never be elevator music let's put it that way
 	
 	
 		uh no exactly exactly you know it is it going to be picked up by a symphony you know and and and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i know and you you'll you'll never hear it in the uh
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		in the restaurants and uh
 	
 	
 		no well i don't know maybe you will but uh you know uh it it it just doesn't translate there is no melody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it it it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know just  give me shelter
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i've i've found that as i've gotten older that that some of even the hard rock has started to to bother me and it
 	
 	
 		well uh the hard rock from your time from our time
 	
 	
 		uh no no from this this new hard rock
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah okay well okay i i i agree with you i don't have any trouble with you know uh uh with with with Zeppelin stuff i don't have any trouble with uh uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you you you you know stuff that that  Santana or or or or Hendrix i don't have any trouble with that
 	
 	
 		yeah me either
 	
 	
 		but i have trouble with with this new crap uh well uh like i say well we've we've done nothing but but prove our age today
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah but it's fun to prove your age um i i get the biggest kick out of my i have uh two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old living at home and uh they
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		well
 	
 	
 		they hear one of these old remakes of a song and oh that's just a beautiful song and i'm like that's a remake they that that song's twenty years old
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		oh no it just came out  that's called music
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well then what you do is you go you know and you and and and you find the original and and and and you play it for them
 		and luckily it it it it of course i i  i was i been divorced but uh my my my my first wife has that first collection of of songs  that that that you could probably prove them with you know
 	
 	
 		well we've got uh four cases of albums downstairs and then we've got another case of
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure you probably have a lot of those then
 	
 	
 		oh yes we do we've got some songs that will that will totally blow my children away um  we've the problem we've been having is that we have a uh an old Fisher system and can't find a needle for it you know because they're not pressing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah oh wow i bet that really is a problem finding a stylus because turntables are
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		are going the way of the of the of of the
 	
 	
 		horse and buggy
 	
 	
 		yeah something
 	
 	
 		yeah so i'm i'm hoping th at we can locate one soon and once i do locate a source i'm going to buy about twelve of them
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh yeah i suggest you latch onto it you know uh i was just trying to think that uh i can suggest something to you you might look at are you familiar with Crutchfield
 	
 	
 		um i've heard of it
 	
 	
 		uh Crutchfield Electronics they also have a catalog and i've found
 		i've got Beta machines and finding hi-fi beta tape has become almost impossible
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i found that i can get it through them they have a lot of you know stuff that that that that um
 		that you may be able to order through them so if you have access to a computer or anything like that you might get one on them of one of them like Comp U Serve i think Comp U Serve has Crutchfield so you can get on with them and and uh
 		and you know and get one of their catalogs
 	
 	
 		great i'll try that out i really uh i really do want to dig out the old LP's
 	
 	
 		yeah if you if you if you have access to a computer and one of the information services uh i would suggest that that's the way you go
 	
 	
 		yeah because i've i've got everything from uh God back when i've got all of Bill Cosby's original comedy albums
 	
 	
 		you've got the real wow far out
 	
 	
 		and
 		i've even got Old Silver Throat that's the one album that he sang on
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah he's horrible he horrible singer  i listened to it one time that was it
 	
 	
 		didn't know that he sang on any of it
 		uh all right
 	
 	
 		and i've i've got stuff
 	
 	
 		listen it's been a pleasure i'm getting ready for Star Trek the Next Generation
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		it's coming on in two minutes so  i've enjoyed talking with you but i got to have my priorities
 	
 	
 		
 
 		all right
 		yeah i know well it's been nice talking to you too
 	
 	
 		all right take care
 	
 	
 		all right you too bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
