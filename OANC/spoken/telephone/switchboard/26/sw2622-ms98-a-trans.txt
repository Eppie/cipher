 
     		
 	
 		so uh what do you think
 	
 	
 		i think we're overtaxed to the hilt
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean we're we're taxed on taxes and um
 		uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state
 		income tax for those who don't have it that is i mean we don't have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through
 	
 	
 		oh really so they have no i didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas
 	
 	
 		no no state income tax
 	
 	
 		oh that's great because they don't have it in Florida in New York they have it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean you know like i say i'm in New York and we have a state tax as well
 		so that just cuts even more
 	
 	
 		yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits
 	
 	
 		right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place
 		you know you you don't see it going to any place where it belongs
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think if it were to be uh
 		if it were to be um
 		if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		if if it were to be spent in the right way i think wouldn't be so upset about it but given that it that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem
 	
 	
 		well we're
 		really overburdened from federal state and local
 		that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that
 		there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck
 	
 	
 		well that's certainly true well what is it they were just talking about um
 		sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after
 		but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think that so they want to you know try and i think they're trying i think that i think that most of the politicians understand this
 		they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing
 	
 	
 		well they're kind of put into a trap of being
 		out there to please the special interest groups as well
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue
 		that's fairness and all is for us to limit their terms
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and by doing so they're not obligated to anybody
 	
 	
 		i agree
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is
 		it's just taking uh  a bite out of our savings
 	
 	
 		right exactly and then and then uh
 		uh i'm i'm just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know but i'm not convinced that's a that that Social Security is doing as well as it should and
 		you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who don't need it but i mean the real people who really need it
 		you know should be getting it but instead i think it's going to the wrong places
 	
 	
 		and i believe the Social Security tax is a great pondsy scheme
 	
 	
 		you think so
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh you know right now they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit
 	
 	
 		i know and that scares the hell out of me
 	
 	
 		and i bet that's illegal see if uh most company uh CEOs were to do that
 		within their private company they'd be in jail
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so how are we letting them get away with it
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i don't well because because they're the ones who make the laws  so who's going to yell at them you know it'd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not
 	
 	
 		a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and
 		feel absolutely helpless
 		to
 		to oppose a lot of the situations going on
 		in the taxing system
 	
 	
 		i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong
 		you know all those things that really could be changed that
 		aren't you know that that aren't and taxes is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so i don't know i i i have no idea what to do about it
 	
 	
 		well there's no quick solution or no sure fire
 		easy answer
 		it's just going to take uh
 		uh really uh uh uh
 		a combination effort i think of the majority of the American people to
 		come to a decisive answer
 		or
 		vote
 		to
 		limit
 		the way it's spent
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		see we we're we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place that's
 	
 	
 		right we don't i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another
 	
 	
 		right and they are controlled or
 		pretty much do what they want to do
 	
 	
 		right
 		i've never quite understood that i've never uh you know even though um i i've never been
 		uh sort of politically minded but it's never been clear to me as to sort of
 		um
 		you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas
 		when clearly their constituency does doesn't back them up on anything you know
 		and often times that will happen
 	
 	
 		well they feel invulnerable invulnerable to uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		any wrath or uh it's it's occurred so many times that
 		they figure people will usually forget and
 		don't think about it when the election time arises
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and generally it does work out that way
 	
 	
 		they do forget it's true could because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politician whenever the the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it becomes uh
 		a general battle of
 		the who sort of the election of the lesser of two evils
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think so
 		i don't know
 		i just uh i'm unhappy with it but and well i'm i'm sort of semi fortunate right now i'm a graduate student
 		so i don't make that much what i make isn't taxed very highly because i'm still in school
 	
 	
 		well when you get out into the real world then you will know
 	
 	
 		but
 		it's
 		my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck i'm just floored whe n i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		especially around bonus time
 	
 	
 		bonus time you have a bonus
 	
 	
 		bonus she no my my wife does
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		my wife i don't no graduate students don't get bonuses we're lucky to get paychecks the way i figure
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so you're taxed on the bonuses too right
 	
 	
 		my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and that's a
 		that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually i mean her bonus isn't that much but they tax it as i i guess they tax it as if
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that were her weekly check or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so she gets destroyed on her bonus check
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so she works with in in in sales
 		so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses
 	
 	
 		uh sales is lucrative but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job
 	
 	
 		yes well yeah she's not entirely sales so it isn't it isn't as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		until i can get a real salary and then get taxed more
 		so i don't know i don't i guess i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it
 		and hope that it gets better
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i have
 		i guess about said what all all i can think of to say
 	
 	
 		same here tough topic so
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really a rather touchy topic at that but
 	
 	
 		i believe i i i do agree with you most most wholeheartedly it's been a pleasure talking with you
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 		you too and uh have a good day
 	
 	
 		thanks for calling
 		you too bye-bye
