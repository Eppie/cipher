 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well this is going to be very boring boring because i don't
 	
 	
 		hi
 		you don't at all
 	
 	
 		no and uh unfortunately it shows i uh
 		i'm supposed to i'm way overweight
 		but uh i've had a problem with uh high blood pressure which of course is directly connected to it and my doctor's trying to get my blood pressure under control
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		before i start in any exercising
 	
 	
 		or too much of it yeah yeah you need
 	
 	
 		so anyway i did join the uh
 		uh the Texans
 		up at uh
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh Springcreek
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i've been up there a few times
 		but didn't accomplish too much because i just run down too quick
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't been up there um but i understand they've got a nice pool and that's my favorite form of exercise is swimming
 	
 	
 		uh that would have to be mine i hate exercising it's so boring
 	
 	
 		really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i would much prefer to like walk through the woods
 	
 	
 		oh yeah most of my my forms of exercise come in the form of a five year old and a two year old
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh running after them or going biking with them or just exploring you know on a little exploration exploration hike you know through the neighborhood it's amazing you know how many earthworms you can find and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and to a five year old they're they never get old you know an earthworm every single time she finds one it's uh it's a brand new exciting activity for her
 	
 	
 		isn't it amazing
 	
 	
 		um-hum it really is
 	
 	
 		well we um
 		back when my my i have four sons they're all grown now and and two of them are married with children of their own but
 		when they were just uh pre teenagers we um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we decided the only way we could afford vacations is to go camping
 	
 	
 		oh yeah isn't it great
 	
 	
 		and we thoroughly enjoyed it i mean we went whole hog we had the tents and everything else and and pretty much roughed it
 		sleeping on the ground and all
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i like to think that my children my sons learned a lot about uh the outdoors uh uh
 		uh being self-sustaining
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh uh i would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be dropped in the middle of no where and they'd they'd exist
 		exist somehow
 	
 	
 		well that's neat my uh my husband was uh was a boy scout and he uh actually went very far in the boy scouts and he was in The Order of the Arrow and he absolutely
 		um you know the earth is is part of him
 		and he is part of it and i think that's a real important thing and we we enjoy going camping we haven't yet had them sleeping on the ground primarily because
 		to them uh or to the five year old the two year old would freak out about it but she wouldn't quite get totally unnerved but the five year old still has a fear of spiders
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm afraid that if she woke up one with her we would have to pack up and come home  so we've primarily done our camping by cabin up at Turner Falls up in Oklahoma
 	
 	
 		oh wow well okay that is understandable
 		oh yes i'm very familiar with it very beautiful place
 	
 	
 		isn't that a beautiful place
 	
 	
 		i've been up there several times
 	
 	
 		well it was up there actually that she got her fear of spiders because we sat and watched a tarantula for a long time we we you know we'd never seen one
 	
 	
 		oh what a shame
 	
 	
 		or she had never seen one we my husband and i had but she we'd never seen one as a family and so we just sat and watched it for the longest time it was you know removed from us by probably five or six feet
 		so we weren't concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that night she had a nightmare and she has been terrified of spiders since
 		but we still go up there and we still have a great time
 	
 	
 		well good i'm glad to hear that about the only thing uh i might suggest is
 		uh do the same thing again introduce her to a to a spider at a reasonable distance where she isn't frightened
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh and that that that the the nightmare i'm sure was just a a freak
 		i'll bet it wouldn't happen again
 	
 	
 		i think not yeah i think it was you know being in a new place being kind of out of out of sorts and everything all combined but
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		we uh that's you you know that's our favorite form of exercise is is life and we do our own yard you know we uh we we enjoy the activities that provide exercise
 		both of us would love to exercise on a routine basis but our life doesn't um really have that much time in it so we just enjoy what we can along with our family you know
 	
 	
 		well that you couldn't pick a better way of doing it
 		with your family
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah we have a
 	
 	
 		and and you're you're certainly all getting an education while you're
 		doing this exercise
 	
 	
 		that's kind of how we feel about it we can't you know there's
 		there's there's things that uh the only thing that is forever is the earth well  we hope it's forever yeah and uh and you know therefore
 	
 	
 		as far as we're concerned
 	
 	
 		it you know the girls can learn things in school about everything that is temporary but as far as really knowing the earth there's no other way to really learn it but to experience it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we really have a great time with it i'm sure that's the way that you felt with your boys
 	
 	
 		oh definitely definitely it was a learning experience uh
 		now we i guess we camped just about every public campground in the state of Florida
 	
 	
 		oh and Florida's absolutely wonderful for that i understand i've i've never lived there
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes yell they used to be but now they're trying to really
 		put it to the the the uh
 		visitors i think they're doing a very stupid thing
 	
 	
 		oh with Walt Disney World and
 	
 	
 		well they charge extra now they there was a time here a few years ago when they put an extra tax on all the campgrounds and the uh motels and hotels
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so they are are uh you know really putting it to the visitors and people got a little fed up with it and they suddenly and suddenly the the foundling fathers of uh of Florida found out that they were losing beaucoup bucks
 		people were going elsewhere for uh their vacations
 	
 	
 		by night
 		they were trying to turn it too much into a business
 	
 	
 		exactly so they got rid of that tax in a hurry
 	
 	
 		oh that's good we've uh not been brave enough yet to brave that trip with these with the two small children  i mean you know in the car
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i can appreciate that
 	
 	
 		it's it's uh it's you know getting up to Turner Falls or uh up to Lake Murray is about as far as we've really tried to go in a car we have gone down and uh
 		uh gone down to the New Braunfels uh San well we were headed down to Sea World in San Antonio
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh we stopped along the way and enjoyed ourselves along the way but um you know that's that's pretty much as far as we've tried with little ones
 	
 	
 		well the the trick is to stop frequently and let the kids get out and run
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now uh i'm alone now myself and and i
 		i have graduated from sleeping on the ground to uh going in a motor home
 	
 	
 		oh um-hum
 	
 	
 		well the fact i live in it and there's just my dog and i now my dog is a wonderful traveler but i do have to stop for her quite frequently
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it works out fine i mean i stop i'm never in a hurry to get anywhere
 	
 	
 		and no reason to be
 	
 	
 		like
 		it takes me two days to get to Memphis
 	
 	
 		and that's that's not terribly far
 	
 	
 		no it's uh it's about an eight or nine hour drive really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i make it in two days because i i don't push it
 	
 	
 		well there's so many neat places along the way i mean you've got Arkansas you know and
 	
 	
 		oh definitely oh absolutely incidentally oh i can't remember the name of that place there's a beautiful park up there
 		and they do have a uh uh oh sort of a hotel a lodge a lodge that's what it is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's just off the interstate and the kids would love it because they have playgrounds for the children and all and they have uh several nature trails
 	
 	
 		it's just off the interstate that goes through Hot Springs
 	
 	
 		uh it's just below Hot Springs
 	
 	
 		um okay
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well that wouldn't even be a very far drive
 	
 	
 		it's lake something
 	
 	
 		i'm not i i ought to look into it uh because we were kind of
 		entertaining entertaining the thought of taking a uh you know like just a five or six day trip in the not too distant future to kind of kick off the summer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i
 	
 	
 		well the next time you go across the state line or when you come back in be sure and stop at one of the Texas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		welcome bureaus
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and ask them for their literature on the the uh state national parks in the state of Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you'll you'll get a collection from them the you wouldn't believe there were so many parks in the state
 	
 	
 		i probably wouldn't and i've lived here all of my life
 	
 	
 		well it it there there are so many for instance have you ever been out to Tyler State Park
 	
 	
 		oh yes i have i have been to Tyler that was one place we went when i was a child
 	
 	
 		all
 		all right you
 	
 	
 		we've not taken our children though
 	
 	
 		there's a place to take them and uh
 		oh good heavens up there just this side of Texoma Texoma not Texoma uh Texarkana
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		Texarkana uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there are three or four state parks up there
 	
 	
 		we ought to head out
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we uh
 	
 	
 		and they're all great and and again there's the
 		nature trails
 	
 	
 		um-hum ah
 	
 	
 		for your exercising
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we almost forgot our subject of the day there
 		but be sure and stop at one of those Texas bureaus tourist bureaus and get their literature
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i certainly will
 		Jack it's been real it's been real uh informative for me to talk with you and i i certainly enjoyed it
 	
 	
 		well it's been my pleasure uh Gina Gina is that with a G
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh-huh it sure is
 	
 	
 		that's that's uh uh Italian heritage isn't it
 	
 	
 		i don't have any Italian heritage my my mother actually chose it because of Gina
