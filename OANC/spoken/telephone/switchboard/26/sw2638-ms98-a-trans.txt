 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well i personally don't have any problem with uh drug testing employees or potential employees do you
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i mean basically
 	
 	
 		basically no um
 		um
 	
 	
 		okay i don't i really can't disagree with it
 	
 	
 		yeah i i uh uh the policy that TI has i think is uh uh very fair
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i
 		they first had a policy where they uh would test new employees and then since i've been with them the last four years uh there's been in the last year year and a half um they're doing random testing of all employees
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i think that's really the only fair way to do it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i really think it ought to be some you know Junkins all the way down
 	
 	
 		and it is it and from from what i understand it is Jerry Junkins all the way down
 	
 	
 		right as a matter of fact i want to think they took the top managers first isn't that a fact
 		i've been retired from TI about a year but the program you know was still fairly new i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		before i retired so i was not uh ever called upon to do a drug test i certainly wouldn't object to it and i think random is probably you know the only really fair way to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah um i like it because um you know i i i grew up in the sixties i mean i graduated high school in sixty eight and
 		and uh you know i i saw you know i know my friends who were you know druggies and friends who weren't and and uh you know it's i think it's a real problem
 	
 	
 		oh i absolutely
 	
 	
 		and i think it and i think it's causing us a lot of trouble and and a lot of problems
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i'm hoping that uh a lot of other companies will will follow the same path
 	
 	
 		i don't think they'll have much choice do you
 	
 	
 		um probably not
 	
 	
 		especially if they have anything do with you know government contracts or anything as matter of fact i want to believe that the uh
 		defense department more or less mandated that people you know who work on defense contracts you know some do some sort of you know drug testing i think that's really what maybe prompted TI to do it i was in the uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Defense Electronic Division when i retired i know it was a you know it was a real hot hot item there i think i want to think maybe they you know really got some nudging from you know D O D to do this sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to be in DSEG myself
 		um A P D as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		yeah so you knew you know the atmosphere then
 	
 	
 		yep
 		very aware of it but i i'd i'd i really like the idea uh in fact i would like to see uh a lot more uh people uh adopt it uh like you know school systems and that kind of thing
 		i mean i'd like i'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		or uh who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs
 	
 	
 		that's right absolutely yeah i don't i just can't disagree with you with you know the basic premise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's to much as far as i know it's you know seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as uh you know the testing goes
 	
 	
 		and i like the idea that they have a uh system where they allow you to uh be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right
 		and offer you you know help if you need help
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		yeah rather than just uh
 	
 	
 		put you out on the street
 	
 	
 		put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		that's not going to help anybody get over the problem i believe it is a a a medical problem
 	
 	
 		no absolute
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		um of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely not to mention alcohol
 	
 	
 		yeah so i mean there's a lot of things out there and
 		things that uh
 		i'm just glad that they uh decided not to uh tax drugs otherwise they'd be legal and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and tobacco
 	
 	
 		that's right  that's right  oh gosh well it's it's a real problem i'm sure
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and and stuff and i uh uh i moved to a TI facility that um had never had uh random drug sampling before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because they were outside of the military sector it was uh an industrial company and you know that TI purchased and so the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 		oh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh they were really opposed to it and you know there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs and that's why they were opposed to it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh it resulted in in a few people leaving
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know they had a lifestyle and they weren't going to change it
 	
 	
 		yep right yeah i know a lot of people who
 	
 	
 		and it's
 	
 	
 		when it first began or at least began was in the talking stage you know everybody knew it was coming it just a matter of time everybody was screaming you know invasion of privacy and all this stuff
 		but a lot of people i think after they thought about it for awhile and you know weighed the pros and cons decided you know it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs of course
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i mean uh you should have no objection to it it's like uh going down to get your license and checking your eyes i mean you know why do i need my eyes checked well we want to make sure you can see
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right yep yep
 	
 	
 		why are we doing this well so you don't kill people on the road
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right or yourself or
 	
 	
 		uh it's a basic  i mean it's the basic premise with you know drug testing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		especially some of the jobs um
 		luckily i've always been in the engineering sector and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as uh you know hurting someone i mean it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah assembly people
 	
 	
 		yeah i darn if i'd want somebody down there that i'm working with side by side you know that could kill me
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		by doing something incorrectly because they were
 		not exactly all there because they were on drugs
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 	
 	
 		so there's a there's a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out and i think in the long run we all benefit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh absolutely yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean if you have uh
 		you know if you're not working with someone on drugs well then you're going to have less accidents and you have less accidents and you spend less money on medical and you spend less money on medical then the company's more profitable
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah sure
 	
 	
 		well then the company's more profitable then maybe they can pay you more if they can pay you more you can buy more and then and it and it goes around you know to everywhere
 	
 	
 		sure
 		trickles trickles up and down
 	
 	
 		yep all over
 	
 	
 		sure does
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah affects a lot of people
 	
 	
 		it certainly does and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i just hope that uh more and more companies uh get on the ball and and start it up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i think they probably will you know if they i'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer
 		i'm not sure every small company could do it
 	
 	
 		well a lot of companies are are coming down in price and i think that the insurance companies are starting to give uh benefits
 		you know reduction reduction in in medical costs if you know they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah it's got to help them too
 	
 	
 		yeah so i think everybody will will benefit from the program
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i do too that's right
 	
 	
 		and i think if if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say well if you impose uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		mandatory drug testing we'll reduce your insurance costs by you know twenty per cent and of course you know the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're going to reduce their own
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no no but it it'll save in some areas yeah right
 	
 	
 		yeah and that'll cover it and maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as a uh
 		as part of the package
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that certainly could happen that's a very very very very competitive business
 	
 	
 		yeah so it i i think
 		i think all around it it's going to help out a lot course
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too
 		i just really can't disagree with you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay well it's nice to talk to you
 	
 	
 		it was great talking with you
 	
 	
 		and you take care
 	
 	
 		you do the same
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
