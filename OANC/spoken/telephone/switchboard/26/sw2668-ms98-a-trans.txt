 		no i'm going to Onum
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh it's a subcontractor house they uh they builds in fact they build product for TI but it's been thirty two years so i mean i've i've served i've done my time
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		okay you ready to talk about taxes okay
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		were you happy with your return this year  were you happy with your tax return this year
 	
 	
 		huh
 		what did you say
 		no  no
 	
 	
 		was it negative
 	
 	
 		okay i guess we're on the air now
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh well what do you uh what do you think uh uh what's your biggest gripe do you think is it the proposed state income tax or the or the gigantic federal income tax we seem to be paying every year or what
 	
 	
 		i think my biggest gripe is the gigantic federal income tax i came from a state that paid
 		uh state taxes three years ago and that seemed to be relatively small compared to like the uh the tax you pay on sales sale items
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i don't know i think uh my biggest gripe is with federal
 	
 	
 		what what state are you from Carla
 	
 	
 		Indiana
 	
 	
 		Indiana you had a state income tax there are you able to credit that against your federal income tax
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah though it's a percentage you divide that well you uh how much you paid or something by your federal
 	
 	
 		oh okay so you do get some credit but not the whole thing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		okay because
 	
 	
 		there's a lot of tax breaks for like
 		you know a lot of things if you're involved in the state like uh giving to colleges and things like that they'll break you for
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		okay what uh uh what generally what percent of your income is it
 	
 	
 		um not even sure because i was a student so i didn't pay that much
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		because as as you know where uh there's there's uh a ugly rumors on the horizon out there that we may be faced with that here in Texas
 	
 	
 		right and what percent would that be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh i have no idea i i i uh i'm i'm originally from Massachusetts but they didn't have a state income tax when i worked when i lived there so i have uh no and i know they have one now uh and i have no idea i have no idea what it is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you know getting to the back getting back to the Federal income tax i remember during the Reagan administration i think it was the Tax Reform Act of nineteen eighty six or something like that when the taxes were reduced and it was made simpler and all that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't believe it it's worse
 	
 	
 		i know well you can't deduct for credit card interest that type of thing
 	
 	
 		oh sure and i seem to have more of that every year and yeah the only thing that's left deductible is uh is mortgage uh interest basically
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and would then and and that's significant and every once in a while they make noises like they're going to take that out and that would just kill the housing industry if they did
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and and uh
 		one other things that i only found out this year and uh uh i thought at one time i worked in Malaysia for TI
 		and and had more money than i knew what to do with so i started making accelerated house payments and i said gee you know this would be great because i'll i'll have a lot of equity in my house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then when my children are old enough to go to college i'll get a equity loan which will increase my mortgage so i'll be able to get money to send them to college and then get the mortgage interest deduction part
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		guess what
 	
 	
 		what happened
 	
 	
 		that that's not legal in Texas it's the only state in the country that it's not legal everybody else can do it but in Texas
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and and so i i got this three thousand foot five bedroom house that i've got almost paid off
 		and have all kinds of equity in it and don't have  and you know struggling to keep i've got two children in college and i'm going to have three by September
 	
 	
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		but but uh it it was just my fault not checking it up because i've heard of people doing it so i thought it was pretty good deal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so but the uh uh i i it just seems to me that the that the income tax is getting a bigger and bigger hunk of us every year
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and and i'm not exactly sure what what we get in return i was listening to a talk show i don't know we ever get any talk shows from Dallas up there but i listened to David Gold this afternoon on KLIF and he was saying that in nineteen fifty four
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Americans paid about one cent on the dollar in taxes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and now we're paying something like a little over fifty fifty cents when you consider federal income tax FICA tax sales tax and all the other things we get hit with
 	
 	
 		fifty cents
 		it's incredible
 	
 	
 		and it is it is absolutely incredible and
 		and and the mentality that you cure ills by throwing money at it and you throw and you raise the money to throw at it by raising taxes is just absolutely terrible
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh is you know do you have children in school
 	
 	
 		no i don't i just got married i don't have any children
 	
 	
 		oh you know you just got married okay well you one of the worst things in Texas how long you been in Texas
 	
 	
 		
 
 		three years
 	
 	
 		oh okay well you'll find out one of these days because you probably came from a state that's got a very decent public school system and you'll find out that in Texas we've got uh i think we rank fiftieth out of fifty states
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise taxes spend more money
 	
 	
 		i think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these schools and they wouldn't have so much money going to so many different schools
 	
 	
 		yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the we've got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is they've got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		than they do in the public schools and and my my son goes to a uh high school here in the Richardson school district which is one of the better ones in Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard that
 	
 	
 		uh and and and uh however my goodness they got an assistant principal for everything
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and and and they've got uh i don't know what the ratio is but they've got a tremendously high ratio of administrative people to people that are actually out there teaching
 		and it is sor t of like we do at TI
 	
 	
 		sounds like TI is was getting ready to
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we get we get fat in those areas and yeah and and and and we got they they got a lot of overhead in those schools and rather than throw more money at it they got to figure out how to get get the most out of the people that they got
 	
 	
 		yeah and then all your money goes to overhead
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and and get them in the classroom plus
 		uh i don't know it seems to me that that more so than when i went to school there are a lot of courses that aren't going allow first first of all they're not college prep courses and i don't think they're going
 		help a person make a living they're just sort of things to get the kids their twenty one credits so they can graduate
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and  and and all that and so i'm not i'm not overly pleased with that either but the uh uh the tax thing and i think our sales tax is uh uh somewhere around eight percent now isn't it
 	
 	
 		right in Dallas it uh might be a little less here in Sherman
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah i i think right here in Dallas we're paying about eight percent and you know uh i say i was initially from Massachusetts i've been here thirty two years but they used to call it Taxachusetts and uh i was there on business last weekend
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and i i made a few purchases and i realized that as bad as their reputation is their sales tax only about five percent
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and i know there were several things that i bought that were something in the order of a dollar and i noticed it was about five cents added onto it plus it doesn't cut it as early you know you buy a ten cent candy in seven eleven here and you pay eleven cents
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		for it and and i notice theirs doesn't cut in much below fifty cents i think
 		so so the little items you pay what the price tag says
 	
 	
 		well
 		now if they propose this the if this you know state income tax goes through are they going to lower the sales tax
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i don't i bet they're not i i'll absolutely bet they're not it it's interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because i've only heard of it in bits and pieces
 		but apparently there was a bill before the federal legislature today to uh lower social security tax but the other end of it they were going to raise income taxes
 	
 	
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		they were going to they were going to give with one hand and take away with the other and i i just heard bits and pieces on the radio today and i i hadn't uh uh i haven't heard that i haven't heard that much about it
 		uh what what kind of a sales tax was in Indiana Indiana
 	
 	
 		think it was like five and a half percent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh okay yeah did you go to school there in Indiana  Indiana University
 	
 	
 		yeah Purdue
 		no Purdue
 	
 	
 		oh Purdue okay you were you were a Boilermaker huh yeah yeah you follow the girls uh basketball team boy we were we're tremendous uh girls basketball fans here and we saw them we saw them play in the Midwest Regionals down in Austin last year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 		oh great
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and we were Lady Longhorn fans naturally but we did see Purdue so we're aware uh that they've that they've got a very good program there
 	
 	
 		yeah they well it's just been the last three or four years actually they had poor seasons before that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and i think they went further this year uh i i think they got into the second or third round of the of the play-off this year
 	
 	
 		yeah they
 		yeah they've been exciting to watch
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh that's an  what did you get get your degree in
 	
 	
 		supervision
 	
 	

 		okay supervision supervision that's an interesting degree uh what what sort of things does it entail
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		lot of theory um it's pretty it's pretty broad
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh took some engineering courses some math a lot of uh a lot of theory lot of practical like personal um problems and personnel problems and that type of thing
 	
 	
 		are you are you actively in supervision now have have you taken some of the TI supervisory skill courses
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah the The Boss Course
 	
 	
 		yeah the Boss Course
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a really good course
 	
 	
 		yeah and and i was i was going to ask you what did you think of it relevant to some of
