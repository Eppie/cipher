 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well have you ever been a victim of any particular any type of crime
 	
 	
 		uh that's interesting  because i've talked about this subject before and it it didn't come up to either one of us to act uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no no nothing that i would consider major probably the most that anything of mine has ever been violated is uh
 		you know like you know how people throw their change like into uh the glove box or the ash tray of their car and
 		one time we had you know some kids go up and down the street and anybody whose car was open they kind of trashed that stuff out but they didn't do any vandalism and yeah it bugged me but you know when i think of crime and and things that could happen
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i guess that was minor
 	
 	
 		sounds like you've been very fortunate i haven't had too many terrible things happen to me but my tee tops did get stolen one time off my car
 	
 	
 		i have
 		ah that's a very popular pass time up here do you have a Vette
 	
 	
 		out of
 		right
 		uh no it's a TransAm
 	
 	
 		a TransAm uh in fact there was a ring i know that you stop right up here and uh the police department would call TI security when they knew they were in town basically and say
 		you know tell all your folks with Vets and whatever else to be look on the lookout for them but that's expensive you know
 	
 	
 		it's very expensive and insurance companies don't like it either
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't want to write you
 	
 	
 		yeah well i i did put an alarm on the car after that
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and uh i kept that for a while until the alarm malfunctioned and started going off in the middle of the night for no reason and
 	
 	
 		oh that's not good
 	
 	
 		it upset the neighbors in the apartment complex so i disabled it
 	
 	
 		well okay
 		now i uh i mean i've had other members of my family touched um i have had a cousin of mine that was murdered
 		uh things like that uh for no apparent reason you know it's that was lost in the country trying to find her folks new house up in Kansas and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		stopped to use the phone and a teenage kid whose parents had lots of money
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh killed her so nothing was ever done to him
 		but so you know yeah i i'm not sure there's many lives that aren't affected by it somewhere
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know what the answers should be per se
 	
 	
 		yeah you stop and think about what you can do to uh to prevent or reduce crime
 		and in fact tonight uh alone i i got a phone call from one of the security uh
 		uh systems home security systems that uh install uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		systems in your home to uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		monitor and uh
 		i guess detect uh it's that that type of break ins
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they uh
 		have a certain fee that they charge each month and an installation fee and they're real hot hot about uh trying to get uh trying to sell these systems to everybody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i um i would like a home alarms that perimeter alarm system i've been very impressed with the one that the Amway Corporation uh
 		puts together because it's it's as extensive as you want it to be you can
 		you can kind of coordinate to your own home you know however many uh types of devices you need and it's a wireless system so it's not one they can disable
 	
 	
 		do you know what the
 		do you know the name brand is for that

 	
 	
 		the name Amguard
 	
 	
 		okay that's the their own personal alarm brand okay
 	
 	
 		yeah they make it uh-huh and
 	
 	
 		there are several systems like that there's one that uh
 		uh employees sale sold once upon a time called Schlage
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that's also modular and wireless and you can add as many sensors as you need to
 	
 	
 		yeah about my husband he's like one of these like i want to have guns and guns kind of scare me
 		uh not so much for me you know i feel like i'm responsible i'd learn how to use it and yes i could shoot someone if you know they were trying to take my kids or take my life or
 		you know i'm basically a nonviolent person but i could do that
 		but it scares me because of so many accidents that have occurred with children in the home that find the guns and
 	
 	
 		well there's some some
 	
 	
 		uh you know accidentally shoot a brother or shoot a sister or shoot themselves and i'm not real sold on that yet
 	
 	
 		right but there's also a lot of people who are end up being victimized by their own weapons
 	
 	
 		by their own
 	
 	
 		a burglar comes in and uh finds a gun and ends up using it against the owners of the house so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well are you for uh capital punishment
 	
 	
 		oh certainly yeah depending on the crime i think i discussed that at at another time
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting that you say that because i am too my my sadness with it occurs that it doesn't seem to be consistent
 		you know i i have a hard time putting one person's death for the same crime that you send the other to jail for
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know it does to me need to be consistent but
 		uh i i
 	
 	
 		well it's such a waste of taxpayers' money too to put them in prison for life
 	
 	
 		for life
 	
 	
 		uh especially if there's no chance of parole
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		of course my husband's of the mind that you ought to take them all out in the back alley and shoot them
 		
 
 	
 	
 		sometimes that's the best solution i guess
 	
 	
 		i don't know i guess i have a little bit more compassion i do think they ought to have their day in court
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		only because there have been ones sent away that didn't do it but i know that's few and far between
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i uh i don't know the answer you know i have always thought that maybe the answer to the dope problem that you know generates so much of the crime is
 		you know always you know shoot the dealers and somebody made the you know take away the supply but somebody made a comment to me a couple of months ago that's kind of had me thinking he said
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he said somebody else will come up with the supply he said what you have to do is you know shoot or make it hard on the users because if the demand is gone they won't have anybody to supply to
 		well that makes a little bit of sense
 	
 	
 		well it makes some sense but uh
 		the the users end up being addicts and they uh they commit crimes for for a living to make the the cash to buy their drugs with so
 	
 	
 		sure
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh and they have no respect or for for any other people anyway
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		but where was it uh oh several years ago and i want to say like Malaysia
 		something with an M Madagascar or somewhere  a small country
 		uh you know it's it's a crime punishable by by death to them to be carrying anything and i think some British ci tizens had gone in like uh a lady and her son and they had some marijuana on them and they hung them
 	
 	
 		oh that was in Malaysia and they they were two two guys from Australia
 	
 	
 		was that Malaysia
 		okay i knew it was something like that and i thought jeez that seemed so severe for marijuana but then i thought or is that just because um
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		i have become accustom ed to other things in hearing other things you know if i knew two of my friends got hung for carrying a little bit of marijuana it might make me think twice before i ever did it if i was of the mind to you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i don't know what the answers are but i
 		i do feel like
 		i do feel like when they're blatant criminals and they've got records that it seems like the system protects them more than it helps the others
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well we're not the only country that has a a drug problem
 	
 	
 		no we're not
 	
 	
 		a lot of a lot of countries do especially smaller third world nations and their governments uh strictly enforce uh
 	
 	
 		death
 	
 	
 		policies against uh drug use and uh uh dealing and things like that so yeah the death penalty uh exists and it is put in force
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i don't know i know that you know i remember growing up and uh
 		you know we'd leave the house open if we were in the house yeah if we went somewhere i grew up in a large i grew up in San Diego
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know if we went somewhere sure we'd lock the doors if it was just down the street we wouldn't or if we were in the house we wouldn't
 		but now you know i come home i lock the door if we open the door i lock the screen door you know i want it locked when i'm in it every time i go somewhere and i i just almost hate that feeling
 	
 	
 		right
 		well you make a habit out of it and it's a tolerable situation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i also grew up in in a rural area and my a lot of my relatives are on dairy farms
 		they would leave the house unattended unlocked  just figuring that if anybody really wanted to break in
 		they would anyway and there wasn't much of value to take any way so
 	
 	
 		well that's one way to look at it isn't it where'd you grow up
 	
 	
 		uh up in uh Wisconsin
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		um excuse me
 	
 	
 		but i've been fortunate i guess in that the only things that have happened to me are the tee tops and hubcaps off cars well
 	
 	
 		yeah that's pretty minor when i think that some people give their lives  so
 	
 	
 		sure uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i don't know the answers though i i i do wish we had a system that was a bit more fair
 	
 	
 		yeah and Plano is pretty good about it too they've got excellent uh police force here
 		uh i haven't seen any any evidence of uh any uh
 		mischievous deeds going on in my neighborhood
 	
 	
 		oh well that's good
 	
 	
 		the suburbs it's not near as bad in the suburbs as it is in the city Dallas is pretty bad
 	
 	
 		right i'm sure that's true i'm sure that's true
 		i do know that our neighbor across the street our development is probably only eight years old
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		maybe not that long we've lived here six years probably seven years old
 		and uh
 		the house across the street you know she walked in one night on somebody and of course he left she was fortunate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but things like that make it real to me and aware that it really is going on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know that's it not a fairy tale world here
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah i know people that have been victimized too a lot more seriously
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's not pleasant to think about that and uh you have to live with that forever so
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		well
 	
 	
 		yeah i enjoyed talking to you about the subject uh
 	
 	
 		and i appreciate you calling it's Gary right
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		thank you very much huh you too bye bye
 	
 	
 		okay have a good evening sure bye
