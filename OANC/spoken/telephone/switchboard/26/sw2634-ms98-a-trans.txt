 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well um i'm uh pretty pro gun control over all i um
 		have had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control and uh
 		i must say that there are a couple of arguments against uh strong gun control which i find very compelling although most of the people who argue gun control with me i find um
 		use sort of canned arguments you know sort of the NRA slogan arguments and um
 		uh so i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it
 		um i guess on a one a scale of one of ten i'm probably around a two
 		in terms of fair restricting guns and i have to admit most of that is uh strong personal distaste i don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very very little effort
 		um and uh guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me
 	
 	
 		well me being from Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i hope you're ready for this
 	
 	
 		um i'll i'll give it a try i've got my Texan stereotypes in place
 	
 	
 		well i'm not your stereotypical Texan i was raised around guns hunting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect i respect i respect them and what their capabilities are
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and on top that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a Green Beret i definitely respect the power of weaponry
 	
 	
 		um-hum it's pretty powerful isn't it
 	
 	
 		and here in Houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country
 		and here here here you go here you this will be border line NRA which i am not a member of
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		i mean you i know you've heard this this slogan um if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns
 	
 	
 		um-hum that applies to anything as well as guns
 		a gun
 	
 	
 		well you've you've got well any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they get out their little Mac ten's they get out there little Uzis and they're going to fight with them and it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm
 		if they want it they'll get it
 		i don't care if if they've got to go
 		down in New Mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border
 		now my position
 		although i have absolutely no use for fully automatic weapon anyway
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		since i am a law-abiding citizen and i have never had a felony
 		if i wanted to buy one i don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it if they want to run a background check on me fine if they want to put a seven day waiting period fine again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if they want to have want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that i've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		what i don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it's  it wouldn't
 		you don't want to have someone making a personal choice in that way i would hope i mean because that means someone the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get to have a gun and someone the personal sheriff
 	
 	
 		well the only well the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has is this guy a convicted felon uh is he a habitual trouble maker are we picking him up every Saturday night for a drunk and disorderly and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know just proving that you're a basically a good citizen
 	
 	
 		but if you're not a very if you're not a basically good citizen you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway
 	
 	
 		if if they want the firepower they can get it
 	
 	
 		so why have
 	
 	
 		it doesn't it doesn't matter how restrictive
 		you're border control points are they'll get it across the border one way or the other
 	
 	
 		so why have any restrictions at all
 	
 	
 		uh
 		okay now go back to that one to ten scale where one being total gun control ten being none i said about an eight
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		um-hum um-hum
 		well we could be
 	
 	
 		i said the restrictions i would like to see on for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun i would like to see them go through either
 		i'd like to see a law enforcement agency not NRA
 		but whether it be the your state police or your county police
 		for you to be able to purchase a handgun
 		you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly
 		handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the three basics
 	
 	
 		well that makes a lot of since to me i mean i certainly feel that if if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but uh
 		i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm they have as much responsibility to know how to do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so
 	
 	
 		well the hands in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as a weapon as a as a pistol
 	
 	
 		yeah  well i'm a bicycler and that scares me too to tell you the truth  because i've been run off the road and all sorts of things
 		well i'm still i'm still puzzled though what is the argument how does the argument work if uh if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway
 		what's the point of putting a restriction basically the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway they're not going to take those courses is it uh is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns
 	
 	
 		well there's
 	
 	
 		if it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices is that uh main advantage
 	
 	
 		uh not necessarily a price thing what is
 		happening at least in this state and i expect to see it in other states very soon legislation's been introduced as
 		that if a citizen of the state being myself
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course i can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unconcealed unconcealed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		okay you you're  you're from California right LA area
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh no Bay area San Francisco Bay area
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay you've been to the city
 		all these people coming around
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		someone attempts to mug me i would just i would
 		as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because i can meet him blade for blade
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now if this legislation comes through he pulls i'm out with my family we've gone shopping we're fixing to get in the car this guy comes out pulls a blade on me i'm going to pull a gun on him now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when you're looking and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick
 	
 	
 		what if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon
 	
 	
 		then it's still equally matched
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		having spent having spent time in combat i feel i feel it before they'll get the gun on me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'm i'm sure i'm sure given given all your training i'm sure that
 	
 	
 		if i'm  we'll draw at the same time
 	
 	
 		you know you'd  if i walk into a bad neighborhood i'm sure i'd want to walk through with you because i'm sure you have good
 		you know u h far far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything
 		um i'm quite concerned that if you let everyone who hasn't yet used a gun in a felony uh haven't hasn't yet committed a felony
 		if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature you're going to start getting a lot of gunfire
 		it's it's hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to it's logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire
 	
 	
 		i actually it's not it's more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody's packing a piece is a deterrent is a deterrence to someone saying well i'm going to mug this guy right here but hey he
 		carrying just as much firepower as i can and if there's if you got to go through a certification course to get to where to where you can carry it in public
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then this individual also knows this guy's pretty good with it
 		now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not that's another trip but
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		in defense of myself defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		even even more so when it comes to my my wife and son
 		anybody tries anybody tries to hurt them i won't even blink
 	
 	
 		yeah don't it
 		no i i understand that what if uh what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake
 	
 	
 		this this is where the question of gun control comes in what i consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh that was the topic
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		say a person uh starts uh uh get all of a sudden my combat antenna goes up and say i've got the vibes this guy's fixing to do something i go ahead and pull my piece
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i make sure this persons sees it so he's got no doubt that i will use it on him and i will use it right then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if he doesn't back up that point he deserves what he gets
 		because i have sent the clearest signal you mess with me you mess with my family i'm going to dust you
 		as it stands now i've got to do that with a blade
 		and the only reason i feel confident comfortable comfortable doing that is because of the training i've had
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		well as as someone who would would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander i feel more comfortable with people having blades because uh
 		you're not going to get  bullets flying around and killing people instantly and uh
 	
 	
 		well if i'm the one doing the shooting i don't miss that's the kind of training i've had i mean it's
