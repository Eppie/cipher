 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay where were where were you from
 	
 	
 		um just here in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh okay because i uh i talked to a professor in uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what was it North Carolina who got the the TI
 		system and he gave to all his students so my daughter's even talked to and i've talked to several people from North Carolina i was just curious
 	
 	
 		that's yes yes that's true i've talked uh-huh people from Virginia and and all over yeah
 	
 	
 		have you too
 		yeah i talked to the professor and i asked him about it and he said oh he says i think i'm the guy that actually uh gave it to all my students so that's why so many people are from this college uh go ahead you you first
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh okay um well the subject we're supposed to be talking about let's see is uh food
 	
 	
 		food
 	
 	
 		what type of foods do do you cook and what would you uh cook in uh uh let's see if you were giving a dinner party and the only reason why i may know a little bit about this is that i'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon and to me that's the type of thing that i like to
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		give in um uh cooking for people and uh if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and uh you don't have to do all that much work you know you just uh slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce  and away you go
 	
 	
 		yeah we have them too and i i'm trying to think which is the best uh that i prefer uh my wife uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it uh and we haven't catered out very much uh we would i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be the man always gets that chore and you have to make it perfect uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've made shish kabob which i like it's fairly easy and fast
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh where i guess i'm thinking of the easy thing to do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for for having uh
 		uh a dinner
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i do cook but not i'm mostly the easy cooker you know the breakfasts and and the steaks uh although i would like to experiment with uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the meals my mother made you know so to speak and i haven't gotten around to that yet uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		what kind of meals did she make that you liked
 	
 	
 		well she was Polish and uh
 		she would make very economical  meals we were very poor different rice and ham and things that uh she would throw things together
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and galunkies and all that and uh i would like to try that one day and she would make
 		spaghetti with pork chops and and special meat balls and everything and my wife of course thinks i'm crazy which i may be too but uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 		no
 		sounds interesting uh-huh yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but dinner parties are a lot of work uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but uh that's that's why i like the the outdoor stuff a a lot better people can entertain themselves i think a great deal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		more uh when you have a barbecue especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and uh you know nothing really fancy like your your shish kebabs where you have to do a whole bunch of work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well that that shish kabob is uh
 		just because it only takes a few minutes to cook you know you get it ready you have to do a lot of work beforehand i agree and buy special stuff but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so far as getting out there and and putting it on it only takes a little a few minutes uh but anyway i'm i'm thinking of the easy way rather than my guests i guess but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		yeah yeah well i i think you do do a lot of work even if people do bring over things you still do uh all the uh housework and get everything everything prepared and utensils and just just everything
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh but you know my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish i'm thinking about uh special dishes and uh yeah it was made out of rice and consume soup uh and bacon and onions
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you'd simmer it like all day long
 	
 	
 		right you'd get the odor of it yeah
 	
 	
 		oh it would because
 		yeah and it was just it was just wonderful that's that's something that i would really like to uh to try and find the recipe for but we used to have that at Thanksgiving time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes
 	
 	
 		because you can you can put it on top of the stove and do this and and there's so much broth and juice in there that it has to uh soak up into the rice all day long in order for it to uh uh to come out fluffy and and nice
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		and that was you know when you were talking about the the Polish dishes uh some goulashes and things like that that's uh that's what i thought about was that Armenian rice dish
 	
 	
 		oh yes we probably ought to try this but it probably will never taste as good as we remembered i guess it gets better and better as we remember it back as we get older you know but we probably should try it uh to do that
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		the recipes are really interesting you know we're probably going to lose them we'll probably forget all about them you know since we're trying to make everything so simple here i am talk about trying to make everything easy you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i uh you talked about Thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times uh something see my wife's from Texas so uh remember we were first married and we were living in New Jersey and uh we were going over to my mother's house for
 		Christmas you know to have a meal and we were on the way over we were just married that very year and she said oh i'm looking forward to a nice turkey i said turkey i said we don't have turkey at Christmas  i said we only have turkey on Thanksgiving i said we're going to have a ham she said what
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		oh
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		i said yeah i said no turkey is only for Thanksgiving and because she had turkey a lot you know and uh that was surprising in the in the east uh we always had ham you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and and and that's one thing also that's another recipe i guess we could talk about
 		now the hams just kind of you know go take it out of a can or or uh a package sliced uh the cans were cooked for hours and hours and and were just wonderful you know i i'd like to try that too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah you know what i found was at Sam's uh wholesale uh stores and uh what they have is this honey baked ham that have you seen have you had any of those
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah i saw them that's good
 		no i i uh i i've i know about  but i think goes
 	
 	
 		if if you ever get a chance to buy one of those i think it was uh twenty dollars for uh i don't remember how many pounds it was but you cook it in the bag that they send it in and all the juices and everything are all sealed in and i tell you what if
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		it's never failed to come out tender and juicy and just and just delicious because i normally don't like ham because it's so salty
 	
 	
 		oh i haven't heard of that yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but with this honey bake that they have that that's the only one i have been able to find there at Sam's warehouse it is absolutely delicious and it slices great um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i'll have to ask her about that
 		uh because we have a delivery guy that comes around that sells i can't think of his name of it uh
 		i don't know i see a can here or a box here Gourmet Choice uh he delivers uh what is the name of this thing
 		i got a box where is it distributed marsh  it doesn't say
 		Gourmet Choices  but he but it's a company that has uh you know a truck that comes around and and they recently had hams they have steaks and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh actually pierogies and all that stuff that uh
 		i i never i wish i could tell you the name of the company but i don't know what it is but uh they recently had a ham that was supposed to be it was boneless and we tried it it was real nice and it was fully cooked and everything we had it for breakfast a long time it was really great
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		wow you know that sounds like it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's that's the only ham i have found that i thoroughly thoroughly enjoy
 	
 	
 		i would like to try the old recipe though of cooking it and and i keep saying this uh
 		to to do the different things that we did but i would like to put one in the oven you know the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours and see if because i don't think in in my married life which is uh twenty six years now
 		we've never done that you know and i remember that when i was a kid uh to have the ham cooking uh rather than that we just ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know and that's it you know
 	
 	
 		wow
 		um-hum
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in the old days we had hams were the meal and i don't i don't think we really have it as a main meal
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's true i i don't think so anymore not with more becoming more conscious of uh fat and cholesterol and and all those good things
 	
 	
 		right yeah that's an interesting point how how have you changed your your meals now have you into that uh looking at those things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah well my parents actually started it and uh getting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		parents that's unusual
 	
 	
 		well it it's true i think my parents are very unusual because uh we grew up in the south where uh you have all the um
 		you know biscuits and gravy and oh fried foods galore and then gradually they started switching over to um plain rice um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		no gravy it's just it really is they uh they're actually they actually uh uh led us through it versus um
 	
 	
 		that's amazing
 	
 	
 		us teaching them you know the uh the finer points but my mother has really high cholesterol so it was one of the reasons which started them off and they started doing this like in the early or in about the middle seventies uh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's amazing they'd go that they have started usually it's the younger people doing it yeah
 	
 	
 		it's true it's true i agree with you so it's really neat
 	
 	
 		i uh my my wife's mother is the only grandparent left and uh she has high cholesterol of course i have i have too but not like hers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i always get after her about salt and everything else and she just will i mean she's going to eat the same way she ate you know her whole life and she just tells more or less tells me to shut up you know
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i like to i'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it's it's not the  i listen to uh Larry Newarth on the weekend he's a fitness expert and uh he talks about you know the chicken and the rice and everything else and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh throwing away peanut butter and all the things things not to eat you know ever i think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away forever and then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know try that sometime my wife says she can't stand it but uh when i make scrambled eggs now talking about a recipe
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i say if i have four eggs not not for me but if i'm making four eggs uh even for my daughter and i i'll take out all the yolks but one
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and it's fine you you don't miss it uh in fact when i when i make eggs for myself
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		if i if i fry them throw them in there i will
 		almost hard fry them
 		so i can take not eat the yolk at all
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you don't really miss it you get the flavor of the yolk
 		but uh you don't eat it at all you know you don't or hardly you get like uh a bite at at the the most
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so uh for cholesterol i mean i'm trying that and it has worked my cholesterol gone down twenty points uh although
 	
 	
 		wow that's good
 	
 	
 		i haven't gotten on the which whether was it butter or cholesterol not cholesterol margarine and all that i don't know know whether any of that is true you know whether the margarines are butter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
