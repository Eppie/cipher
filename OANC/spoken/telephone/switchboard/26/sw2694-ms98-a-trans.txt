 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well what have you had done recently to your automobile that you're just really excited about
 	
 	
 		
 
 		really depressed is a better word i actually it's being done as right now as we speak
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i had uh
 		i guess that's something i could kick myself about i uh and i guess this all started with a
 		leaky water uh pump and uh
 		let the engine get overheated and uh right now they're pulling the heads off my engine and uh having to do uh replace the head and the exhaust manifold and so forth it's uh
 	
 	
 		oh that's major major isn't it
 	
 	
 		oh about five hundred dollars worth so far i guess around
 	
 	
 		is that all
 		
 
 	
 	
 		in there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well now this certainly isn't something that you could do yourself is it or would want too
 	
 	
 		um well it some people could probably do it themselves uh i'm not one of those
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i'm not about the only thing i can do mechanically with a a car is put gas in it
 	
 	
 		are you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know how to take care of it but i wouldn't attempt to do anything although i did used to try and change the oil
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well actually i did start i did some things myself when i before i found out what the problem was or how serious it was i tried a few things like changing the spark plugs and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		pulling the PCV valve out
 		checking uh some of the things that might have been wrong
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i do you know some minor stuff but i don't really like to do uh car work all that much
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'd rather do woodworking
 	
 	
 		oh that's more interesting would i would think
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i had the uh brakes changed on my car and what went in what i went in for i thought was rather a routine um not real expensive but you know maybe expensive but it turned out to be a four hundred dollar brake job
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and they they work okay but the noise is so loud there's such a whirring noise and they tell me that that should have gone away in two hundred miles but i
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you should of you should of never been there to begin with i don't know i would suspect
 	
 	
 		really
 		well i've still got it after about seven hundred and i'm taking it back in next week
 	
 	
 		um
 		especially for four hundred bucks
 	
 	
 		but
 		well i didn't know see that's part of the problem you if you're not aware and um
 	
 	
 		and you just uh you know you just never know and you know you feel like you're getting taken of advantage of a lot of times
 	
 	
 		i agree um
 		i i guess you know the money has to be spent and that car has to be taken care of but you would hope that uh people would be a little bit more honest with you
 		i guess maybe the key there is to get more than one estimate but i i get so tired tired of having to run here and run there you know
 	
 	
 		yeah that's not easy to do too because uh you know a lot of them will pull it apart and start on it and then they want to then they add things on to it or whatever you can't always get an estimate i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's very true
 		well i guess we've kind of covered the topic huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		car repair we could go on for days huh
 	
 	
 		current yeah i'm afraid so more than they want to hear
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so well i hope you have good luck getting yours fixed
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll uh i uh i hope so too i've got uh
 		my fingers crossed i was expecting that i might hear something this afternoon but not so far and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but we shall see have a nice weekend
 	
 	
 		thank you very much and the same to you bye-bye um-hum
 	
 	
 		okay good talking with you bye
