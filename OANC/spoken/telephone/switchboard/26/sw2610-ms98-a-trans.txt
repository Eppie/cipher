 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so how do you feel about the metric system
 	
 	
 		oh i like it i i i have a foreign actually i have more than one foreign automobile and i i i find the uh i find the the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters i was trying to build a shed
 		and they give you these measurements like forty two and three eighths inches
 		and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths uh
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's i forget how many millimeters so you used the metric
 	
 	
 		well no what we did was wind up using and you just go you just go down and and you get out the the so many inches and and we just marked a little bit less than that
 		uh which is somewhat awkward but had it been millimeters you could have done i think what's interesting the way engineering people do is they they in essence have gotten around it by by listing uh decimal inches
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		do you are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah uh i work in metal fab
 		and tenths of inches are are normal and
 		you know metric you know it is broken up in you know the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for in tenths hundredths thousandths ten thousandths of an inch
 	
 	
 		well have have you do you are you involved in any other uh metric type things like
 	
 	
 		yes i am i i have a Suzuki motorcycle
 		and
 		and i've had motorcycles Japanese motorcycles for years and years and the metric system comes easy to me
 	
 	
 		i think it's interesting you went you know when you you go out there and you're looking for a wrench and you want the next size larger i've got i inherited some some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds
 	
 	
 		but my
 		right
 	
 	
 		well now that one's fairly easy because that's probably slightly under half an inch but some of them like like twenty seven and and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that that uh don't translate
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah transfer yeah to go from from eighths to sixteenths to uh thirty seconds and remember where it falls it
 	
 	
 		yeah and and you've got to go over there and try it and i suppose you know i need a larger one i need a smaller one i mean obviously you can look at it and say well
 		anyway i think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't i don't know do you do you drink adult beverages
 	
 	
 		yeah i drink beer
 	
 	
 		well that have you noticed that um that a lot of the um a lot of
 	
 	
 		yeah whiskey is in liters
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and and the next yeah point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters yeah
 	
 	
 		it's like a fifth like fifths of whiskey i thought was always kind of strange
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what's a fifth of whiskey
 	
 	
 		yeah i i always wondered about that myself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it was a marketing ploy
 	
 	
 		and and they had quarts at the same time though
 	
 	
 		yeah but the idea was is that by with five fifths um they could uh they could uh they could sell five and and
 		um it was  simply a ploy to to get people you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to buy to buy more for it's uh i find that interesting but it's like you know the the the the soda and this kind of things coming in
 	
 	
 		it's
 		liters
 	
 	
 		one one liter bottles and um i i think it's kind of generational although i must admit that that i am not
 		i can i'm not conversant in saying you know that's three centimeters away i mean or or or
 	
 	
 		yeah it it's
 		like i say i work in a machine shop and uh
 		everything's still inches
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 	
 	
 		everything's still fractions of inches or parts or tenths or thousandths or or
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's hard to think though
 	
 	
 		yes it is a mental thing it is a conversion thing
 	
 	
 		it's like a mill you know we we do uh um well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill conductive bond wire on on semiconductor devices
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and well what's a mill and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		but what really annoys me is the way we in the United States have been converting to metric
 		we have a eighty nine Chevy Blazer and before that we had a Horizon uh you know Plymouth Horizon
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		both of
 		them were a mismatch of both
 		American and metric
 	
 	
 		don't you find that interesting uh that they that  that they're doing that uh in any field for how why why why pieces could you could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't
 	
 	
 		uh okay the engine itself was mostly metric
 		because it came from Canada
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and the starter was
 		Bosch American so
 	
 	
 		the bolts were were English were were English then
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		it was it was annoying one one half of the starter was you know three bolts on the starter and two of them were
 		American and one of them was metric
 	
 	
 		now that's strange
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you go from the uh water pump up to the
 		radiator and on the
 		water pump
 		it was all metric and
 		and on
 		you know the factory fittings you know the factory uh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		screw lock uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh radiator hose clamps
 	
 	
 		essentially they do that though because if if you look at General Motors the size and and and of course Ford and Chrysler if they all went if they all went metric but in a sense um
 		you know it's like when you a measurement though when when you put uh you know one point four three two inches when when you're milling something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh you simply set your uh equipment or or you measure or you got your calipers there and and you measure you know you  it to see if it's accurate and
 	
 	
 		right it's it's not a problem either way like i said my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car
 	
 	
 		and
 		no
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you go to look at it and you don't know which set to reach in American or metric
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		and you're never quite sure well is that a metric bolt
 	
 	
 		you get you a pair of metric pliers right  and you beat on it and a metric hammer
 	
 	
 		right right
 		it it can be annoying and my other concern concern is
 		is the American government going to force us to go
 	
 	
 		oh i think i don't think so i i think that that uh i think they've now just taken the attitude that well if it happens if it because it there a lot of things that that uh um like sports you know it's a hundred meter
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		and uh uh but automobile races if it i don't think they'd ever it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred they're not going to
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they're not going to change that to meters it will always be
 	
 	
 		yeah and and it i i don't think it i don't you know i don't think i don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality uh you it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold how many ounces of gold
 		you know i was trying i was trying to figure up gold content on something it had has uh gold plated uh header
 	
 	
 		twelve
 	
 	
 		and and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce
 	
 	
 		yeah there's twelve troy ounces to the pound
 	
 	
 		yeah now that makes you know
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 		and is that going to change too
 	
 	
 		well i mean and and then there's a metric ton and then there's a ton but what's a metric ton
 	
 	
 		uh see i don't remember i i read it
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		and are we still going to maintain drams for perfume
 	
 	
 		yeah and and then but then the medicine and and some of these other things and and the chemistry in those kinds of areas milliliter
 	
 	
 		it's all metric all ready
 	
 	
 		yeah and and so um but but when you go to order a drink um you know well you say they they i don't know it's uh
 	
 	
 		and what will a shot be will a shot be an ounce
 	
 	
 		i don't know and and but you know when you go to the store and and you're trying to figure you know well this box is is uh is is twelve ounces and and this one's uh uh three pounds um and you
 	
 	
 		and the other one's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		two point one keys and and you're you're lost
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		and and
 		i don't know i i think that i i think i think the Federal government is going to more or less leave it alone i think they've got i think there are more pressing problems
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the economy uh what i was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling
 		personal tools to be able to do his job
 	
 	
 		yeah but but are are the tools that uh if you're cutting are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for that for set up
 	
 	
 		uh tools for set up and for measurement
 		uh you got to have
 		a one
 		tenth indicator it's a hundred dollars
 		uh five tenths indicator uh usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each uh five tenths indicator
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		at about a hundred dollars you got to have uh six inch
 		set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars you got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars uh
 		one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars a two to three for eighty dollars a three to four for eighty dollars
 	
 	
 		so you've got thousands of dollars or so i mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools
 	
 	
 		real fast
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		real real fast edge finders and
 	
 	
 		but i was thinking about though that that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning
 	
 	
 		well i know because okay
 		your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		but when you when you when you simply drilling a hole i mean a real simple thing like gee i need a hole there
 	
 	
 		what size hole
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as in metric size hole or a or an American sized hole
 	
 	
 		yeah and and what but the thing is then you've got to with screws and that's the other issue uh the pitch and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well and thread
