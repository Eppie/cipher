 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		here we go i guess we're on the air huh yeah well i tell you what this been pretty nice today hasn't it
 	
 	
 		yep
 		uh yeah we've been uh real lucky here it was one of those days where you wish you uh you didn't want to have to go back into work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i'm well i'm on i'm taking some vacation this week so it didn't bother me uh i'm a distance runner by hobby and uh i might say it was a little humid running out there tonight i was probably wetter than i have been in some time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh for for a guy that likes to be outside as much as i do and run like i do this Texas is almost ideal
 		because uh i would say probably i run three hundred days out of the three hundred and sixty five and there's probably not more than thirty of those days that i can't wear shorts and tee shirt
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i have to wear long sleeves and maybe some long pants and that's fine with me if i can wear shorts and tee shirt i'm perfectly happy
 	
 	
 		yeah i would
 		i remember how the weather was when i was down there i got a sunburn in February working on my uh my roof in a house in Plano
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i uh i remember how it was yeah it's it's really great um here on the east coast we've you know we usually have the traditional April showers but it has just been so unusually wet here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've had all the rain that they should've had out in California
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well what what what we like to do is get enough rain so not to have to water the lawn
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's been i've watered once in March and not any time in April because i figure we figure if we go five days without rain we need to water and just about every fifth day we're getting rain right now
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		so everything is pretty and green here and we're not really uh and not having to pay money to water
 		and uh of course of course summers summers uh i i guess uh once you get climatized and i am i mean i kind of look forward to the hundred degrees days except except for the air conditioning bills i i could i could do without the three hundred dollar electric bills
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember those
 		yeah well we've moved into a new house uh at the end of February
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and of course it's a new development and there's only one house in the whole thirty houses that are here that has grass
 	
 	
 		oh for goodness sake oh i know what that means
 	
 	
 		so everything everything else is mud
 	
 	
 		that means mud in the road yep
 	
 	
 		there's mud in the road there's mud on the sidewalk there's mud in the house i mean you just can't get away from it and of course it's been you know ideal weather for grass to grow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		and unfortunately they haven't gotten around to put they you know they were waiting until they got i think the other two houses on the cul-de-sac on one done before they're going to plant all the grass at one time
 	
 	
 		what what do you do you put in up there do you i mean here we know we know two grasses Saint Augustine and Bermuda uh what what do you normally put in up there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you can put in any number of grasses up here uh a lot people like the red fescue they like to mix red fescue in with uh Kentucky Blue um the uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my favorite is uh a zoysia grass uh when i lived in Laura which is about sixty miles south of where i'm living now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh that my neighbor had it and i was forever trying to get you know decent grass to grow in my yard and he talked me into trying to some plugs of the zoysia and i just loved it because the zoysia you can uh you can quite literally just plug it around the yard
 		and it just spreads and it chokes out the weeds and the weeds can't get in there and so you don't have to weed and feed and do all that other crazy stuff you just you know the only bad part about it is during the winter the grass is brown but i mean you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		oh that happens here too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but this year of course we got uh we had a very mild winter this year with very little freeze
 		uh so we didn't have any problem uh uh with the uh uh with the grass greening up quickly you know last year it was well into May before all the bare spots got covered
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh because of the of the severe winter that we had around Christmas of eighty nine but this year it uh
 		we did have some cold days but not down in the single digits or anything like that so when things started greening up in March they greened up and everybody's grass is is
 		is perfectly green do your homes you say you moved into a new home are homes normally built there with central air conditioning is that part of the uh the standard for a home
 	
 	
 		yes pretty much standard now
 	
 	
 		oh okay i i didn't know whether you were far enough south for that of course i'm i'm from New England my parents are there and it's it's unheard of there i guess anybody that wants air conditioning goes out and puts a window unit in
 	
 	
 		well the uh the thing about uh Maryland is um the last few years uh since i've been back and uh it was like that oh it started this way about mid seventies
 		um we started having a very abbreviated Spring
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you would go  from having fifty sixty degree days right into the eighty eighty five degree days which you know in Texas it's not bad because the humidity is real low but here when the temperature is eighty degrees the humidity is eighty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no
 		yeah the humidity is eighty degrees along with it
 	
 	
 		and eighty per cent and and and worse i mean i've seen days here when the humidity is like ninety three a hundred per cent and it's just absolutely the worst feeling in the whole world
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-hum
 		yeah i'm i'm aware of that did you have a very severe winter
 	
 	
 		uh not really we had uh a couple uh real good snow storms uh but they were the kind that came stayed for a couple of days and then melted off and that's the best kind to have around here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay
 		yeah yeah we we had zero snow here in fact we haven't had any measurable accumulation now in six or seven years uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember the uh ice storm back in uh nineteen eighty eight
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a nice one too that was an ice storm there and uh uh i remember one year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can't tell you the exact year it was probably about uh eighty seventy nine or eighty that we had such a severe ice storm that it uh knocked tree limbs down on the wires and there were some uh four hundred thousand homes out of electricity
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and i know it was after seventy eight because we built our home here in seventy eight and it was a new development that didn't have any trees yet so we had electricity and we had fifteen people camped out on our floor in sleeping bags
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and and unfortunately when it thawed then most everybody's houses got filled with water too  and uh but we we were fortunate that year and even at that this development was built in seventy eight and even now all all the utilities run under ground
 	
 	
 		oh God
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so there's still no big trees in the development but the uh uh all all the utilities so we we wouldn't have to look forward to that but we had a uh we had a mild winter as i say the previous year
 		we had three or four days uh it it wasn't much it was only about a week and i think it was the week just prior to Christmas when the temperature got down into the single digits
 		and as a result a lot of the the trees and uh the grass and shrubbery was killed uh was killed out and at this time last year nothing looked very good but it it does right now uh at this time last year
 		we were under water most of Texas was under water uh if you remember uh uh uh downtown Dallas you could go down and look up in the Reunion Tower and look over toward the Trinity River and it looked like lakes not a river
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah i remember that
 	
 	
 		and uh Lake Texoma was up uh twenty feet over flood level
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		uh at at this time last  year it was it was uh it was pretty bad but uh i'm i'm hoping you know you you don't want anything to flood but you want to get normal rain and uh we're probably some where near normal right now
 	
 	
 		yeah i noticed uh tonight when i was out driving around that the uh the one of the main reservoirs in the county i live in is uh fuller that i've ever seen it i mean it's it's up over its banks but it's not that far over its banks
 	
 	
 		how long have you been back in Maryland from Texas
 	
 	
 		uh moved back here in uh eighty nine
 		yes so i spent two uh just about two years exactly in Texas
 	
 	
 		eighty nine okay
 		yeah and where did you say you lived in Plano
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i lived in Plano
 		um worked at Spring Creek for a while and was on the moon job and then when my clearance came through for APD i worked for DSEG uh worked at North Billings for a while and then down at Love Field
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		oh okay okay that's a nice facility at Spring Creek isn't it that's the that's the Taj Mahal of TI facilities
 	
 	
 		oh God
 		i tell you it spoils you rotten to work there you
 		you work there and they send you any place else it's like you've been demoted
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well well we're in the i don't know if you're familiar with the center complex
 		uh in in Dallas it's across LBJ from the main TI site it's three glass buildings and that for someone that's been at TI thirty two years this is kind of unTI like too
 	
 	
 		right
 		i had a uh a uh an employee that i hired there Lita Mytek
 		Lita Mytek i mean she uh she worked over in the building at Center Three i think it was and uh you know she said she liked it over there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i'm in i'm in center one the big thing that i think other than the fact that we've all got double the size offices we've ever had anywhere else and it's so quiet that you can hear a pin drop to me the big advantage and i didn't realize it when we came over here is the covered parking
 		it is amazing in the middle of the summer when it's a hundred and ten out to go out and be able to get into your car and touch the steering wheel
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which we could never do parked outside of the SC Building or the South Building or various other places that i've i worked and and you notice the finish on your car lasts longer when you wash it it stays clean longer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh it is is uh uh to me to me that's that's probably one of the biggest advantages that we've got over there plus i'm in center one and the credit union is down on the first floor
 		and it seems that i'm always always there i've got a daughter away from college away at college that's always out of money so it's easy i can get down to the credit union quite often and uh are you looking forward to a hot summer there now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i'd i'd prefer it not to be that hot
 		uh the the days usually aren't aren't that bad um it's just when the humidity gets up i mean it's like last week we had a day it was i think it was eighty degrees but the humidity for some strange reason was only nineteen per cent and that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh that that's Texas like
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a rarity for here and God it was just beautiful
 	
 	
 		that's Texas like
 		did you ever get out to Midland while you were here
 	
 	
 		no i never did
