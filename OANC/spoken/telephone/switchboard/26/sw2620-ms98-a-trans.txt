 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right i i think our experience of camping is i i am the the passive member i get things ready and then i enjoy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh because my my husband is a good camper and so they he manages the troops and they do the work and i have fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well uh uh your you said your family was grown uh all grown up now how about when they were younger did you go camping take them camping
 	
 	
 		that's when we camped the most when i thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because uh i it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just uh was really overworked you know and and getting out into nature and relaxing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and having the family do a good share of the work you know and the part that i did was more fun than uh than labor because they did the the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and kind of organize you know
 	
 	
 		yeah but even
 		even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun isn't it
 	
 	
 		it is isn't it it isn't have what kinds of things have you tried
 		have you done uh uh uh the big pot cooking
 	
 	
 		oh oh uh well
 		it was really my ex who did the the uh uh the cooking back when we first started
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we found that the you know what was one one great handy things was this uh uh uh hamburger helper
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		because all you needed was a big frying pan you dumped everything in together
 	
 	
 		big frying pan
 	
 	
 		and it was enough for all five of us six of us
 	
 	
 		oh that's interesting you know interesting enough uh the food part was kind of uh important thing in our camping uh when my oldest son
 	
 	
 		six of us
 	
 	
 		uh always at the beginning i did all the shopping and everything but the the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his uh
 		uh cooking merit badge in and and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef Stroganoff and uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i mean you know he did it up really good  and so uh after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and preparing getting ready for it
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		it was it was a marvelous experience because after that then all i had to do was uh follow the instructions you know and do and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things like i would take corn bread and uh
 		cook a pan inside of a pan over a over a camp uh stove and it works real good it's like an oven
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well
 	
 	
 		just put uh put a thing on it
 	
 	
 		cooking was our secondary interest i mean
 	
 	
 		what did you like to do most
 	
 	
 		well really just commune with nature
 	
 	
 		that's neat isn't it
 	
 	
 		we started out uh well we were living in Florida at the time
 		and we early in life we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very very expensive
 	
 	
 		right i agree
 	
 	
 		so my ex decided we're going to try camping and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that's how we got started we did it for years and years uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 		well now in Florida is there is there times are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp
 		or is it always kind of hot
 	
 	
 		well yes uh yes and no i mean um yes in the winter time yes it's it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly but uh there's really no time of the year that you can't go
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh is that true now now we're we're in Texas now and you're in Texas right
 	
 	
 		uh because
 		yes i'm in Dallas
 	
 	
 		okay uh we have not camped a great deal here because uh a good share of the time in the Summer time it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping
 	
 	
 		well it just depends on where you go for instance if you went down to the sea shore it would be wonderful a nice breeze blowing in from the water
 	
 	
 		i guess
 		yeah yeah we have done that
 		but but we camped mostly when the kids were little we were in we were in New Jersey
 	
 	
 		oh where abouts
 	
 	
 		and we uh in uh Allendale and uh and uh Waldwick it's just about twelve miles south of the New York border
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp and it was so you know pick your own uh blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast  uh also go ahead
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes yes i come i come from up in that area i'm a New Yorker myself
 	
 	
 		oh are you where did you live
 	
 	
 		a little town called Tuckaho over by White Plains
 	
 	
 		oh oh yeah i know that i had a cousin who lived in White Plains that's a that's a neat area but it's a that is a particularly neat area for camping
 	
 	
 		well that i wouldn't know i left there when i was quite young
 	
 	
 		because
 		yeah it is neat though because there are lots of lakes fairly near by you don't have to go very far
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh and there's uh a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of uh hiking sort of things and and we had uh collapsible boat which we uh clipper little clipper sail boat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so we would sail and and uh did a lot of camping that way
 	
 	
 		well uh me i outgrew uh sleeping bags and uh tents
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i now have a motor home
 	
 	
 		oh do you we've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis and it's fun too i think
 	
 	
 		well i live in mine yes
 	
 	
 		do you that's neat so you kind of uh uh an everyday camper
 	
 	
 		uh well yes i consider myself what they call a full-timer
 	
 	
 		
 
 		a full time camper well now are you living alone now or
 	
 	
 		yeah the
 		yes well just me and my dog
 	
 	
 		you and your dog huh  hey that sounds great well we don't we don't camp quite as much as we used to but uh i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yes definitely
 	
 	
 		and enjoy nature and uh kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life i'd always
 	
 	
 		nothing like the fresh outdoors
 	
 	
 		right i'd always come home just relaxed and uh comfortable and ready to go at it again so it was a neat activity
