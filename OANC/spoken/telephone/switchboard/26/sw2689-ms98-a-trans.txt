 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 		what can we do about crime i don't know the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people and they keep letting out people that have you know these horrible records
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so maybe we need to have more
 		prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something that's one thing i guess i could think of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it's definitely a big concern i mean every day it's you know all are even we live in a little small town and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time and you just can't get away from it no matter where you live
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's pretty scary
 	
 	
 		well i i'm i'm from Butler and i can't say that there's too much of that there um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i know the bigger cities have problems with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i really don't know what we can do about it
 	
 	
 		yeah it's rough because
 	
 	
 		unless they start enforcing the um
 		
 
 		uh start giving more people death sentences that's the only thing i could think of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous i mean you hear about people you know six and seven times have committed burglaries and they're still you know only serving six months in prison
 		so that's definitely something they could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like you know from one month to ten years or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that would be one thing that you know i think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties you know for certain crimes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i don't i don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse
 	
 	
 		yeah and one things that they're saying now are you going are you a student or are you in the work force or
 	
 	
 		um i'm a senior at Clarion University
 	
 	
 		oh okay because one of the things that i've heard so much about lately um lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much and apparently many of the
 		especially like in date rape many of the um you know perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up and they don't really
 	
 	
 		well not only that a lot of them's not even turned in
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know what i mean a lot of times the girls don't even report it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um i've heard of a few cases up here but i can't say that i've heard of uh you know any significant amount uh but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they say like only one in ten are reported i believe it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's it's awful so one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it i know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing but
 		i'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing you know for people to report it so that's probably something else they could do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs you know and that's like as long as it it almost makes me feel in a way like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have you know because these kids are saying why should i go
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you want to sit down
 	
 	
 		to high school and so i can go out and work at Burger King you know for four dollars an hour or whatever when i can make uh four hundred dollars a day selling drugs
 		so that's certainly a big problem i don't know what the solution to that is having more drug treatment centers available jeez i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh
 		see see now i would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything i know a lot of people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that partake in that and i'm not saying they're bad people but i i i would say that's a bigger problem
 	
 	
 		yeah because it ends up even if it's just kind of like this social drug use you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin you know
 		huge amounts thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent you know on higher and higher up on drugs and it's definitely
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		got to do with crime you know you hear about people selling their babies you know to get some crack i mean just oh gosh horrible stuff like that one of the things they're doing is is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they said um some of the statistics statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack and their moms are crack users
 		so that's you know another way of looking at it as as the woman is being a criminal you know for doing that to her child
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i don't know who's the victim there i mean the kids are the victim it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted and
 		it's a very complicated problem i don't envy the government trying to cope with it gosh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no i don't either
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i guess that's about all i have to say is there anything else you would want to
 	
 	
 		uh no i can't say that i i just know that it's really bad in some areas and something's going to have to be done sooner but
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't know what they can do
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's frustrating
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well it was nice talking to you uh you too bye
 	
 	
 		okay well thanks for talking have a good day bye bye
