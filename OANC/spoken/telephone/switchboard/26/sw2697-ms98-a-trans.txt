 
     		
 	
 		okay you've do you have a uh monthly budget
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well um
 		we we do but not an official one i mean basically we know we have i i think i'm a little crazy in that we keep so many different savings accounts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we'll have our checking account that's just the the money that we use and spend
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then we have a savings account which is money where we work our credit cards in such a way that we charge everything and then we write it out like it was a check
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we're never we pay off our bills in full we're not paying any interest but it's not a big surprise if we get a large bill because we have it all written out already
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then we have another checking account another savings account which is like for heavy duty savings you know that's just taken out of our paychecks every week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then we have a a fourth sort of CD type arrangement um where you know it's in a CD and we can't get to it
 		so i guess our budget is just what's in our checkbook we don't say we have x amount for entertainment x amount for gas it's just we know some weeks we might be able to go out for dinner two times some weeks one time some weeks three times
 		um so there's nothing really that we have written down for a budget
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i'm a saver i would rather if i had twenty extra dollars i would rather save it than spend it and that's my philosophy and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sometimes i i you know i think that that's not necessarily the best way to live but i i always think that you're going to need it for a rainy day you know how about you
 	
 	
 		right
 		well we're very very similar we i have worked
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for a goal of saving three months' salary
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and and we put that uh in a account
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we just leave it there that's our emergency account if the car breaks down i mean we can take money out of that but you know then our goal after the next month is to rebuild it up to three months' salary
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		now we've only we've recently done that so now we have extra money
 		we don't have to slap in that account so we're looking into mutual funds or uh just uh common stock you know anything like that that we can get a higher return on our money
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh see we do have the checking account we have Carla works for TI so she has a CODA plan you know where she puts in if they put in a dollar she she puts in a dollar you know TI pays fifty cents
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		it's sort of like a matching fund then she gets like eight percent interest on top of that so that's been uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		pretty juicy for last couple of years
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		one nice thing that my company does um and i know this is going on all over the country but
 		they allow you to put into um a certain fund
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		whatever you think some of your major medical expenses are going to be for the year such as any prescriptions um if you wear glasses or contacts any expenses you might have for that
 		any dental expenses you anticipate if you have kids day care that sort of thing um outside of a major medical hospitalization problem anything that that might be medically related
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so you claim that amount at the beginning of the year let's say you determine that's five hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they'll withhold five hundred dollars from your paycheck um broken up into fifty two weeks so whatever that is divided by fifty two
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and what what in in a sense happens is you end up paying those bills in pretax dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you have something like that
 	
 	
 		no well they may have we just haven't taken advantage of it
 	
 	
 		it's really wonderful in our case we don't have that many medical expenses thank God and so i only claim two hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i my salary in a sense was lowered by two hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they break that up into three dollars and eighty five cents a week that's taken out automatically and then if i go and get my teeth cleaned for thirty dollars
 		i pay the thirty dollars and then i send it in to the it's Blue Choice i send it in to them and then they send me a check back for thirty dollars but the nice thing is that that thirty dollars i wasn't taxed on
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		initially because it it almost looked like i never made that thirty dollars and it's really wonderful if i this is the first year we did it and uh next year
 		i i'm just going to claim a lot more if you don't spend it all then you do lose it but i feel we could have benefitted from even two hundred dollars more from it
 	
 	
 		huh so
 	
 	
 		but uh it's a nice little savings account and then they they tell you if you'd like you can put the money that you save by not paying taxes into a savings account and they'll do like what you mentioned about matching it and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		so if you don't use it in one year you lose the hum
 	
 	
 		yes if you don't lose it so if you decided to claim or or put aside five hundred dollars and you only spent four fifty
 		they let you know each quarter and they'll let you know you have three hundred dollars left two hundred dollars left but if it gets to be the end of the year and you haven't spent that fifty then you do lose it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's time to go get your teeth cleaned again
 	
 	
 		yeah right  or just buy a new set of glasses or  or whatever
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's that's true too
 	
 	
 		but i i don't know how people can really live on a budget our i mean a budget that's really written out
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um you know this amount of dollars because you your life just fluctuates so much and i mean each week is so different some weeks you're just going to go over that and some weeks you're going to go under and so to me it's just easier to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well there again we both have the natural tendency to save and like so if we have the extra money we're going to slap it away as opposed to someone else who goes out and blows it
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		yeah that's true that's true
 		right
 		that's true yeah a very good point
 	
 	
 		so for those people that are in debt like you said you pay your credit card off at the end of the month and so do we because i hate interest
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right oh i hate it too
 	
 	
 		so i mean but some people don't care about interest
 	
 	
 		well you you know some people look at their their credit card limit as a loan in a sense and they um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if their limit is twenty five hundred dollars if they have a hundred left they'll spend that because they think they have it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then will just end up paying interest for the rest of their lives practically
 	
 	
 		right it's a vicious circle
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is
 	
 	
 		yeah credit cards are good if you use them correctly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but they can be very dangerous if you don't
 	
 	
 		oh they sure can that's for sure
 	
 	
 		especially yeah that interest is terrible
 	
 	
 		i know
 		and you know they send these applications out to college kids and college kid gets an application that says y ou've been approved for this amount of credit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		automatic approval
 		and they get them and then these kids start charging and
 		and they get themselves into some deep trouble before they even start making money they're already in debt you know let alone loans and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		
 
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah that sounds like you uh now what are you doing you've got your big master savings account that you're going to use to retire on or something or
 	
 	
 		well it'll be a long time before that's something we can retire on but um
 		it's yeah it's just uh something that's automatically taken out of our paychecks each week and uh it goes for an emergency we had a disastrous storm here about seven weeks ago and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Rochester was in a state of emergency for three weeks and everyone lost their power and we had to pay over five hundred dollars to have a tree removed
 	
 	
 		oh man
 	
 	
 		and it wasn't covered by insurance so that's something where you you don't plan on it's not something that you can you know you're not saving for a trip or whatever it's boom here it is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you just have to pay for it so it's an emergency fund but when we got married we you know obviously got some money and that that's what's put in the CD
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and to me i i try and forget that we even have that because i don't want to think about that um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it would be nice to just not always think about saving like have a have a twenty dollar bill and think oh maybe we'll just go out and buy something with this and it'll come
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah we i just did that my wife's birthday was yesterday and yeah so
 	
 	
 		ah really
 	
 	
 		i'm very tight you know with my cash and we haven't really we don't go to malls and shop because they're too expensive and you know we'll buy things here and there but she had we haven't really went shopping for her
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah it'll
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you know but she's been really good and she hasn't really said much and i go well look you know today we're going to go out and get something so we went out and blew about a hundred bucks but you know for us that's a that's huge for me you know but you know some people do it every weekend
 	
 	
 		oh isn't it great
 		oh i know you mean um-hum
 		oh it's incredible
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		we really do
 		i i i like discount stores i have no problem with buying an a no name brand of something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i'm not into labels and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		our fire our smoke detector's going off  making French fries
 	
 	
 		uh oh you're not cooking are you
 	
 	
 		um my husband's making French fries  or burning French fries one or the other but um
 	
 	
 		that's funny
 	
 	
 		i feel fortunate that my parents instilled in me you know a sense to save and and you know watch where your money goes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i that's very valuable yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's good
 		that's good
 		sounds like uh you know what you're doing
 	
 	
 		yeah i hope so we do you too was your wife always like this or was she did you have to
 	
 	
 		did i have to train her
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no she she's really good she uh she didn't uh
 		you know she doesn't go out and buy clothes without me knowing it and like Blondie in the cartoons you know she doesn't do anything like that she's not big on sales and all that she's just really she's really great she's really content and just uses what she has and then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i know kind
 		um-hum
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		you know she just you know some day
