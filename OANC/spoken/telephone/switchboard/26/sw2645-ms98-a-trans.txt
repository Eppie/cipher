 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		so the general topic is hobbies let's hear about your hobbies
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well let's see what kind of hobbies do i have i guess uh i it's more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing i enjoy playing basketball and and basically all kinds of sports and uh excuse me
 	
 	
 		any handicrafts any handicrafts
 	
 	
 		no not not really um no i i'm really not too creative well i uh you know around with my hands and things like that i leave that more up to my mom
 	
 	
 		so i i think i'm developing a new handicraft i think it'll become resume writing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh  well let's hope that you you you aren't employed employed by that craft for too long
 	
 	
 		uh yeah i i hate to think about it and and i'm getting rather good at reading want ads yeah it it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what what
 		what kind of time frame is it uh looking for the uh different shifts up there
 	
 	
 		i  who knows
 	
 	
 		is it uh basically i had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it Texas
 	
 	
 		no all means about fifteen to twenty percent of
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		of oh i'm sure the numbers somewhat classified but it's on the internal news and the news services so it's approximately six fifty so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		ten percent of six fifty sixty five and twenty percent would be one thirty
 	
 	
 		wow how about that yeah that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's possible
 	
 	
 		how about that well that's uh that's unfortunate is there many many other are you in the defense
 	
 	
 		oh yes that's  here
 	
 	
 		is it uh it many other corporations in the area
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i saw 7-Eleven that was hiring
 	
 	
 		well i'm sure with the new uh awarding contract awarding i i think it went to Lockheed didn't it
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that uh i hear they're hiring all over the place for that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh no Apple's coming to town and and that has some opportunities and uh and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		now is that actually just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs
 	
 	
 		Colorado Springs specifically yes
 	
 	
 		how about that
 	
 	
 		and uh and uh MCI's coming if if telemarketing is your bag personally i'd rather die a slow painful death but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		were you in the uh computer operations or in the actual uh manufacturing
 	
 	
 		uh i'm a defense worker a government tool control specialist
 	
 	
 		right yeah that's why i was in the DSEG down here in Plano also
 	
 	
 		are you still employed
 	
 	
 		am i still employed by TI no i took a leave of of TI back in November
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		actually December was my first month away from them
 	
 	
 		exempt or hourly oh yes
 	
 	
 		exempt
 		it uh uh fortunately i guess for myself it wasn't uh it was purely by my own choice
 		it wasn't uh there was no incentive for myself to leave but it was just an opportunity arose and decided to take it
 	
 	
 		oh so you didn't even get the severance package
 	
 	
 		
  
 		no i should have taken the the the you know uh option when that was there but it was just i missed it by a couple months
 		but you know what can one do i'm just happy to still to have a job
 	
 	
 		so are you happy with what you're doing now
 	
 	

 		yeah i am kind of happy with it it it's getting better all the time i knew it would be different from the very beginning but you know as as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system so i was in the computer operations
 		it's uh you know it all starts to become similar there's you know there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good but as an overall package i'd say i i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		good good well hasn't been a long time  TI or i i'm
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		significantly shaken by the situation
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but not devastated
 	
 	
 		um-hum well the the one thing i guess at least in your favor is the the fact that that that is more in the support of the manufacturing and there's lots and lots of companies that have
 		maybe maybe not in the defense the defense area but manufacturing in general
 	
 	
 		tell you the truth i'm i'm i'm not really worried
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that's great that's good
 	
 	
 		and and i seem rather happy about it most of the time just just to know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what's
 		possibilities are you know what might happen
 	
 	
 		sure yeah sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table
 	
 	
 		but
 		still in all
 	
 	
 		it may be a blessing in disguise
 	
 	
 		it feels funny
 	
 	
 		i know a number of people who are uh surplused and they're just actually what the positions that they've found outside of the company were much much better than the ones that they currently had inside
 	
 	
 		so
 		despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or or going for walks in the mountains i can't seem to get into it right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		exactly
 		uh-huh well i'm sure it's just with the the the the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide decide on a pass
 	
 	
 		uh situational i i doubt i'll be here in six months
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well would you like to be there
 	
 	
 		i
 		all things being equal yes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what
 	
 	
 		but or or even somewhere better but
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		God this is much better than west Texas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  well just take the day
 	
 	
 		but then they they tell me hell is much better than west Texas
 	
 	
 		well actually uh the the the Plano Dallas Houston you know Austin that whole area is is actually quite quite nice
 	
 	
 		i my little brother lives in Austin right now
 	
 	
 		oh that's a beautiful place
 	
 	
 		goes to UT
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's just fantastic down there take it more as a this is your opportunity to do whatever you want pick out where you want to live and then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do
 	
 	
 		i
 		see that's the problem for the last many years i've more or less let them direct what i want to do and where i want to go
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and just kind of go with the punches
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and now i feel lost
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah that's a it it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it
 	
 	
 		oh i've had job offers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but
 		i never found the one that was worth it for me to leave
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well the best thing about it is that you can uh try something if you don't like it shoot move on to something else that's the way i've uh looked at the whole thing here i'll take a chance if i don't like it i'll go someplace else do something different
 	
 	
 		and that
 		oh so had you been with TI long when you changed
 	
 	
 		five years
 	
 	
 		well there's a noticeable difference there i've been with them sixteen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i can imagine you know the longer and longer it goes
 	
 	
 		actually seventeen now and
 		oh yeah momentum is uh driving force in our lives
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		so yeah i'm looking as as a opportunity
 	
 	
 		well that's good you've got a good attitude about it
 	
 	
 		and and i'm looking at it as
 		a change
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm looking at it as
 		as
 		an adventure
 	
 	
 		right there you go
 		that's the way to do it
 	
 	
 		and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid off between now and then
 	
 	
 		there you go that's the thing to do
 		that's much funner than doing any kind of job
 	
 	
 		huh how about we end this
 	
 	
 		that'll work out just fine
 	
 	
 		nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		all right nice talking to you good-bye
 	
 	
 		bye
