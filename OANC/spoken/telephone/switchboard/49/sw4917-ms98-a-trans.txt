 
     		
 	
 		an interesting topic
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes the uh type of cars that i was uh uh i would probably be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a uh Mazda Miata
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the uh i'm very much uh a fan of sports cars
 	
 	
 		ah boy you and my husband would have a whole lot in common
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		yeah the um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 		though actually in some actually if i have i have avoided i've avoided buying a new car for quite some time
 		i'd rather put my money into restoring my old cars i have a old Triumph TR Six
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh so uh but if i was to buy one probably something like a Miata it's certainly it i wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		what's the how old is your car
 	
 	
 		uh well i have a i have a nineteen eighty five uh eighty five CRX
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh which is you know it's it still works fine  but it's  it's actually it's kind of annoying cause i've got no reason to  to replace it but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh
 		yeah so what do the Miatas run
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh those are they're about uh uh thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and you know a bit more if you add some some options and so on but
 	
 	
 		well that's not too bad
 	
 	
 		the uh yeah that's a pretty good price and they're they're they're they're so so nice to drive uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really i've never driven one
 	
 	
 		uh it's it's it's nice  they're uh i've been down to a dealer and driven them and i've also driven one at a something Mazda put on where
 		uh they went to uh auto cross events across the country uh which is where you race in uh
 		you you race on in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of uh cones to see who can get through them fastest
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh yeah about a minute or so and uh very twisty stuff and oh it handles so nicely
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and so you've done this oh okay oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it was just it it it's just so smooth and yeah nice car
 	
 	
 		really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what are you interested in
 	
 	
 		whatever my husband buys
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you don't you  you don't get involved in uh car decisions
 	
 	
 		oh not too much no we um
 		we just got rid of a full conversion van that that i i it that wasn't me that was my husband he wanted the van and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there T V you know the whole bit
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i never drove it so it just it wasn't me you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i can understand well would you want if you had to decide what would you want
 	
 	
 		and then
 		oh i'd want a minivan  because i'm with the kids all the time yeah yeah and
 	
 	
 		okay yeah they're nice
 		oh yeah that's perfect for that
 		it's not it it's small enough that it's easy to drive
 	
 	
 		yeah you pick up i pick up my little one from preschool and the whole parking lot's full of minivans but you know i i drive a little Subaru
 	
 	
 		holds a lot
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we i love that uh we were going to trade that in for the van but i just wanted to hold on to that because i just really enjoy that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um that's really all i needed was for something just to go here and there and back
 	
 	
 		yeah uh minivans are nice i have a friend who has a minivan and uh i've driven it a few times and uh it's nice it's nice of course
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know my family my family has always had cars like that uh in that yeah my father has had a had a always had a VW bus every since uh nineteen about nineteen sixty or so
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		uh i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they  he he uses  he often has to transport plants or uh things like that cause he's he goes to orchid shows and and you know fills fills the car with plants and so on or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's amazing what a minivan can do we went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan and pulled uh um the little trailer behind the pop up trailer and uh it's so it's really amazing how much a minivan can can you know what it can do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah and they're not that expensive
 	
 	
 		no they're not
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they probably we probably
 	
 	
 		mainly because everyone makes them you know you can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and we we do a lot of um driving we do a lot of traveling by car and so that's the only time that the that the uh conversion van came in handy but it really didn't cause our our kids are still little
 	
 	
 		hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um  that was the only time we really needed it other than that it got terrible mileage and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah Minivans do do pretty well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know twenty twenty twenty five miles per gallon or more
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some of them probably even do thirty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		yeah there there's some other cars i'd like but i uh uh i would never be willing to spend quite that much money for uh like uh uh i'll drool over them
