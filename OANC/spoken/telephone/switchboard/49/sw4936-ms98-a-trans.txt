 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		why don't you start
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know i um
 		i refinished a couple of
 		old uh dressers that were given handed down you know it's nice tongue and groove um
 		uh construction
 		uh
 		huh that's just i've been pretty successful with that
 	
 	
 		things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing
 	
 	
 		no i've done some other things too um you know
 	
 	
 		i've yeah i've done both  uh i have had my wife's picked up a couple things saying uh boy if we could refinish that that'd be a  beautiful piece of furniture and uh and we've done it a couple of times
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess that we've been fairly successful with those that's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it i guess
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah that's a good way to get started
 	
 	
 		um i have a a um really nice desk a nicer desk than i could afford which i got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we stripped it all the way down and refinished it it turned out to be really nice uh pretty nice desk maple top i think or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or something of that sort
 	
 	
 		yeah i i put together um a um rolltop desk from scratch you know a kit
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh i'm jealous
 	
 	
 		still had to cut it and everything but yeah it's fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah  i've i do do things uh that
 		might be too crude to be called woodworking i've built my own deck and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um  things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've done the same you know like the trim around the house you know the baseboards and things like that
 	
 	
 		and i
 		i definitely have begun to accumulate tools too my i uh
 		i picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive and so i do have a band saw and a router and um things like that out in the garage but i can't say i use them very often
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um i i'm looking at trying to get a router right now
 	
 	
 		they're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times putting doors in is the time when i'm uh i bought myself a um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		template for making mortices and doors and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i've also i've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh
 	
 	
 		i'll bet
 	
 	
 		because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months i had it and now i i use it twice a year maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah my brothers my brothers used it a lot for making drawers
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the big stuff
 	
 	
 		i don't know what what's your opinion of what a good router is like
 	
 	
 		uh i guess it
 	
 	
 		you know i had
 		because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great they've plastic parts and stuff
 	
 	
 		the ones that what
 	
 	
 		that you dial in on the side
 	
 	
 		uh i have never even seen i've never even looked at one closely and the the little use that i've gotten from my router i would say
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i would spend my money on the bits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i have a i'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router and the um
 	
 	
 		how strong is it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three eighths of an inch at a time
 		but the problem is that the uh as with any any time you buy um a a tool with as as as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end
 	
 	
 		don't they um-hum
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so  the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably um i mean a a good set of bits is probably gonna run you a hundred dollars and uh um
 		if you're gonna use it for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it because  um imagine if i go and sharpen them myself uh it won't last
 		and i've never had the bits sharpened
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's a thing to consider is to
 	
 	
 		they they really get hot don't they
 	
 	
 		yeah and they they dull after a while especially i did some cabinets in um ash and oak and uh that that wears a bit down
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth  and
 		uh routing hardwood will um take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast so
 	
 	
 		yeah i've cut some one by eight oak before
 		
 
 		boy was that fun big solid pieces of oak are just tough
 	
 	
 		right that's uh
 		and then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that was you know with a with a circular saw like oh my gosh this gonna be fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i've used mine on treated wood and now all my blades need sharpening
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh the treated wood will also chew them up
 	
 	
 		yeah treated wood can really make you sick too if you're not
