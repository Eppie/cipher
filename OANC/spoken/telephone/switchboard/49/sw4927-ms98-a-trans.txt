 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh mandatory service yeah i don't think it's a good idea
 		uh because we'd have to change the Constitution to  to uh allow uh involuntary servitude uh in service to the government
 		and i'm not sure that we could do that in such a way that we could avoid winding up a slave state
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's i like the idea
 	
 	
 		and in what way are you talking about
 	
 	
 		well  i like the idea of voluntary voluntary support i mean they might be able to ah say that anyone who does that uh gets certain benefits that  would not be available to someone who didn't do it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but to use force um really sets us a a it it essentially says that your body there's a title to your body and that title belongs to the government and you are not a free American citizen
 	
 	
 		right yeah right
 	
 	
 		the idea itself of service is good
 		and when someone is say out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt that's the best time to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well
 	
 	
 		see i i yeah and i also thought that um that would interfere with with college work and
 	
 	
 		yeah unless it were tied directly
 	
 	
 		they didn't
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if someone were studying something uh let's say take something obscure somebody was studying economics the State Department could offer to send them to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them how to run their country
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		as an extreme example right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but in reality i think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to for their own will and i just don't think it would work
 	
 	
 		when do they assume this is gonna be proposed or mandatory or when when i what what year are they looking at
 	
 	
 		well they're not it's been suggested and it's sort of a topic of debate every time it comes up it gets voted down the uh people who are pro-military oppose it because they don't want people to have the right to opt out of the military into something else
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the people who are pro-constitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the United States is actually under attack
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		so mostly it's just kind of one of those things that goes away  ah they've got a noisy line
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		i thought that was your line
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's somewhere between here and there
 	
 	
 		uh what age group is are are they looking at
 	
 	
 		uh oh eighteen the draft age yeah  wait a minute yeah  let me see if i can get on a cleaner line if it's my line um
 	
 	
 		eighteen yeah that seems normally that would interfere with college i would think
 		i moved maybe that is that's part of it
 	
 	
 		yeah it is my line i was on a radio phone
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		all right that's better yeah no there they they figure that they can draft you at eighteen age they usually do draft you at nineteen and that's the age they're looking at
 	
 	
 		oh hm
 	
 	
 		and of course they're this one the women would be equally grabbed and they're almost on the verge of saying that you if you're gonna draft men you're gonna have to draft women and you're gonna have to put them in front of the guns just the same
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so uh if you're near that age or you know somebody who is uh you know be aware of that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		well that's kind of scary  i'm not near that age  i'm way over it but i do have children to think about you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh okay
 		yep and you don't want them sent off to the Middle East to help defend Bush from Saddam after Bush gets done arming him
 	
 	
 		that's kind of scary
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know we only find out about that a year after the fact
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's another thing when in doubt don't trust the government at all it's really reached that point
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh hm
 	
 	
 		hey you're in Perot country i'm really thinking that this guy might be good for us
 	
 	
 		i do too
 	
 	
 		i've been it it seemed dangerous i thought is the guy a closet fascist and then i find out that he helped rid the United States of the Gablers
 	
 	
 		he's he's helped out in a lot of ways yeah he's he's from Dallas or he's in the Dallas area and uh he's very well known around here so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'm in the computer biz too so i know he's well known in the industry they uh i i have high hopes for him and i think that you know if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us then i'm for him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i i
 	
 	
 		i mean in the Democratic primary i'm gonna vote for Brown just because i kind of like Brown and his attitude but when uh when it really comes down in the fall i think i know where it's gonna go
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i i think he's got a very good chance so there's a lot of people here pulling for him
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 		i don't know  we'll just see how did you uh  you work in the um computer business that what you said
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you know this
 		yeah i'm an end user i teach people how to use Macintoshes and how to buy equipment and desktop publishing magazine production and things related to that
 	
 	
 		oh okay well my husband works for um Texas Instruments and so um that's how we found out about the Switchboard
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah oh that's their project too isn't it i found about it on the network
