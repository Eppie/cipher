 
     		
 	
 		well my exercise program consists of uh you know it's it's a it's an opportunity to stay alive really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hm
 	
 	
 		instead of wasting you know wasting my my  you know the the trying to exist on the latency of my youth and the good health of my youth and it what i like to do is i like to stretch out
 		and i like to run uh my i'm like to run get my heartbeat up
 		i like to run about oh about two two and a half miles and then i like to work out on uh on the uh uh the Bailey Life Cycle uh Cycle machines up here at the at at the Holiday Spa
 		and and and i i think that you know i've had a regimen now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that
 		and uh and you know i kind of think it's uh it's a lot of work but i think it's uh it's the uh you know the the amount of effort that's required
 		to uh to stay healthy you know i have a sedentary job and uh unless you do something like that you know you're going to get sick
 	
 	
 		right yeah i'm i need to get i'm i'm i'm pretty bad about that i'm lazy i should i know i want i always say that i need to get running start running and i going to try and do that this summer
 		because i never have time i i always put it off by the time i get back from classes it's late at night and i don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever because i i'm i'm getting a gut here i got to get get back into shape
 	
 	
 		well i uh two years ago i started having trouble with my knee
 		and uh you know i've got a you know i figured well it'll go away well i started you know i'm i've had to reduce my program reduce my program and i've gained fifteen pounds
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and so uh you know it's you you know i need to get back into swimming you know instead instead of running if i can't swim or i can't run i should be able to swim
 		well i'm such a terrible swimmer and i i i really feel i can i can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes for to this effort but if it gets longer than that i i it it i start not doing anything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so i i got a real problem in that regard
 		uh it do you you obviously are are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean it
 		i do it i guess i'm going to do it um because i want to get in shape
 		i'm not it's not something i really enjoy all that much although i'll i'll i'll probably i mean once i get into it and i if i if i get into better shape then it'll be it won't be as much of a a chore to me
 	
 	
 		well it's it's always a chore i i mean i started doing this when i was about thirty five and now i'm fifty five
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i i know that in  i just know that i'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense you you know some health related thing is going to blow me away that's same way i got too much weight on right now
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i need to lose fifty pounds you know i need to lose at least twenty you know but uh you know it's it's just uh i'm busy i'm doing a lot of traveling and uh it it creates a problem uh you know when you're on the road
 		what sort of uh uh what what what other programs other than say running have you have you ever done anything at all
 	
 	
 		yeah i have um
 		sit-ups or also also last summer i was doing Nautilus or last year
 		i um belong to a club around here got kind of expensive uh to renew to renew renew they wanted another fifty dollars that was a little bit too much money but um doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights

 		but generally you know i can i can get in and get a program in
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh you know i i need to i need to rededicate myself to uh to doing this and uh i got a problem uh you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it i mean i've been doing this for fifteen twenty years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know and i'm i know i'm going to get i know it's going to bite me in the ass so i i really don't want to want to uh you know back off on it
 	
 	
 		yeah it's something i it's like uh i'm young and i should get started getting into shape i don't want to at one i mean one point it's going to be too late to do it like
 	
 	
 		well no when you're young you you can abuse your your all your systems and you can recover
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye
