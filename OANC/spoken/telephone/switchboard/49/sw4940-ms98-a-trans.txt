 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay Carol
 		so air quality
 	
 	
 		yeah is it i know in here uh downtown Dallas it's you i mean you drive by and you can just
 		you can see it  but then again  i was originally was from California and uh there is a big difference between Texas and California
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		surely
 	
 	
 		and uh they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner and of course they don't have that here in Texas
 		so there's
 	
 	
 		you mean they don't have the uh the smog alerts
 	
 	
 		no not in not in Texas not well not in Dallas that is
 	
 	
 		right i i yeah i spent a summer in in in Tyler
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i know
 		just east of Dallas there
 	
 	
 		yeah we're going there tomorrow uh-huh  we're packing and getting ready to go to
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah
 		actually i'm a California born person
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i was born in LA so i know what you're talking about in LA it's pretty bad
 	
 	
 		yeah oh okay yeah you do then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um the worst city in the in the world is actually uh Mexico City
 	
 	
 		is it really i would not imagine that
 	
 	
 		yes
 		the worst one for smog is Mexico City
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		the most polluted city in the world
 		
 
 	
 	
 		huh you learn something every day
 	
 	
 		is that crazy
 		yeah i know that they've they're looking at uh um
 		you know uh you know better running automobiles
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i've seen that
 	
 	
 		um
 		some things they do one one one one of them is they're using corn in fuel
 	
 	
 		huh i huh-uh
 	
 	
 		you ever heard of that yeah Methanol
 	
 	
 		huh no
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's big up here because of the  they grow a lot of corn
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah that's one thing that they do and at at that it's pretty easy to do and the uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		unfortunately it still contributes to global warming cause you have to wipe you know wipe out forest to grow corn and things like that it doesn't make sense
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		uh  but it's you know one of the most uh productive crop in the world is corn
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
 		and of course i doubt if there's any you can buy regular anymore you buy unleaded right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		drive cars with catalytic converters and all that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's interesting they're they're looking at at
 		there's some work being done on uh automobiles that are electric powered
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically but it has a a engine in the back that charges it so the engine kicks on when the batteries need power and it turns off
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		interesting thing about gas is when i mean about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light you're not using energy any energy
 	
 	
 		huh that is good
 	
 	
 		unlike a car where it's running
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		electric car it's on demand i mean it's either on or off basically
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you don't have to shift
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so you cars become very simple all of a sudden too
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		very interesting
 	
 	
 		that would be nice
 		i think i saw that on TV one time they maybe it was CNN where they were demonstrating that or something similar to that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		there's a there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and Ford and General Motors and all those compete
 	
 	
 		but what what what i think that was a setback a a setback that they i don't know they went i don't know how many miles an hour i think like twenty
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		was was that something maybe it was i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah GM uh Chrysler announced that they're going to they're well they actually have an electric minivan
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah their their Caravan
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but it costs uh fifty thousand dollars right now
 	
 	
 		yeah and they're they're very expensive too
 		i was gonna
 	
 	
 		to operate yeah
 		but you know people are buying them you know whose buying them the power company
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		free you know free for them
 	
 	
 		well yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of interesting so see
 	
 	
 		well it doesn't make sense because if they want people to convert you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they should make it worthwhile
 	
 	
 		yeah it's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour so it's a good good vehicle
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah hum
 		well i'll tell you sometimes it's it's pretty bad here today like today i think it was pretty bad i don't know if it was if it's just uh allergies or what but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		some days it's really it's very nice here downtown and other days it's just really bad
 		so
 		i don't know
 		so what what kind of things did you experience in LA when you were there or can you remember were you there at a
 	
 	
 		oh i wasn't there too long ago um
 	
 	
 		cause i haven't been there probably
 	
 	
 		well you know you going over the hills you know coming into the valley you can see that horrible horrible brown haze
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we were there when they had a
