 
     		
 	
 		happen to know what the laws are in Texas
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh capital punishment is uh you know accepted an accepted punishment it it's legal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh there are uh there have been a number of executions
 		over the last few years
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		they drag you know the the appeals drag on interminably it seems sometimes
 		um personally i kept i keep thinking that if i could be guaranteed that
 		the people who perpetrate some of these vicious crimes were never allowed free then i would not be in favor of capital punishment
 		but when
 	
 	
 		oh i see what you're saying
 	
 	
 		but uh when i know that
 		uh they could be paroled and go right back to doing what they did before i i feel decidedly uneasy uneasy about it
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		what about New York
 	
 	
 		well in New York i'm not quite sure but what sounds familiar to me is that  it's it's not legal except in cases of murder of police officers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh okay
 	
 	
 		i might be mistaken but that's what sounds familiar to me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh so we don't hear about it
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i was visiting in California recently and apparently they over about two weeks ago they just executed one fellow
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it is legal there but they they always put it off and put it off and they finally for the first time in twenty five years executed someone
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um-hum
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so that was quite the news
 	
 	
 		i remember reading about that
 		um
 	
 	
 		is it only usually in cases of murder sort of an eye for an eye kind of thing
 	
 	
 		it's uh it's more than that i think it's a capital murder uh where
 		uh there there was an intent to do other harm as well you know where you you engaged in another felony like robbery at at the same time that you murdered someone
 	
 	
 		okay i know there's a a subtle subtle difference between manslaughter and murder
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i guess you can commit manslaughter by running somebody over by accident that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		by accident
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 		that's my understanding of it uh but that uh murder is something that you do intentionally
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i don't know it just seems to me that
 		everybody wants to know if they do something what's going to happen to them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i substitute teach and i have kids who talk fresh don't do homework and they say so what's going to happen to me and
 		and people getting less and less respect and they understand they know that the bottom line is not very much is going to happen to them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so if i could be sure that the people who are sentenced to execution absolutely did it because you know during the with the jury system you're not quite sure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no you're not
 	
 	
 		you know i i i'd feel comfortable with it if i knew absolutely certainly that this person actually murdered someone
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		or
 	
 	
 		but i i think the reason we don't go for it is because we're afraid that we might be making a mistake and you can't fix it
 	
 	
 		that's right and and it's a terrible thing to do uh
 		and the world our world seems to become more and more violent all the time by the way i'm a public school administrator  so
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well did you do you find that the kids are changing and they they don't they they don't respect authority anymore
 	
 	
 		oh
 		at all
 		they they do not respect authority uh they kill for fun
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		uh
 		they shoot guns for amusement after parties um
 	
 	
 		hum well the guns are legal where you are it's quite a to do to get a gun around here legally that is
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well it it's not it's not legal to carry a handgun in Texas but no it's not you can have it in your home
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that
 		okay
 	
 	
 		or in your car if you're traveling
 		from one city to another
 	
 	
 		oh okay that clears that
 	
 	
 		but uh rifles shotguns those sorts of guns are legal
 	
 	
 		um-hum well they can do just as much damage
 	
 	
 		oh yes it's just that they're harder to hide
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		but i do  i feel decidedly uneasy about the judicial system in our country now not only because we can't be sure that the jury
 		you know has made the right decision that the person who did it's really guilty or really isn't guilty
 		and yet i feel very uncomfortable about the numbers of people who are paroled put back on the streets and within a few months are raping and killing other people
