 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and you say you have some strong feelings about uh the issue
 	
 	
 		uh yes i do as far as uh
 		as far as uh
 		as far as immigration as a whole goes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think that uh we simply must start
 		accepting everybody in the world
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i there just is not gonna be room for all of us we don't have jobs now
 		i i think uh i think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time
 		um  hope you're one of the employed right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i am one of the unemployed right now
 		i was a systems analyst and programmer for an oil company
 		and uh
 		i applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings but they had two thousand applications
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here you you know doing my line of work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and of course i'm not perfectly happy about not having a job
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so how do you feel
 	
 	
 		well i'm a little bit ambivalent the problem with uh
 		and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in
 		in terms of what uh really is driving it they're not willing to tell the truth the same way with um uh issues of uh race and things like that
 		i mean right now
 		um i believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration three actually
 		one is at the high end uh they always wanna be able to um do some brain draining
 		they'd always like to be able to attract the uh Einsteins or the Professor Chou or you know they'd like to be able to get the top people in any field and so they can almost always find room for someone like that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		at the bottom end
 		they um
 		are always willing to um let in cheap labor  if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area
 		those are two  things that i think are going on although they i i i don't think the politicians would tell you that
 	
 	
 		okay and i think you're right in both cases
 	
 	
 		and then the third thing  is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico
 		
 
 		they cannot close off the Mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be uh
 		uh would spill over to this country so they keep allowing um the pressure cooker to um
 		let off steam
 	
 	
 		and i think probably it's pretty important right there how do you feel about Haitian immigration
 	
 	
 		uh  that's one of the few things i guess i found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan
 		
 
 		i think they're very difficult group to integrate into uh society they're very difficult um group to find jobs and uh and uh places for
 		and so um um i don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that uh in that they're pretty miserable where they are
 		but i'm not to sympathetic about um
 		letting large numbers of Haitians in
 	
 	
 		actually
 		actually i feel  that if we accepted these people
 		that we would eventually have almost the total population here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it would have nothing to do with political situations it would have to do with poverty
 	
 	
 		right
 		but if you let them yeah if you let them in a million at a time it wouldn't make that you know it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population but politically politically and economically
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh have you been to have you been to Southern Florida
 	
 	
 		yeah well i know about it uh i mean it's it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans uh twenty years ago
 	
 	
 		well i mean and the two of them together i mean we can it's just as well  you know it's hardly America anymore
 	
 	
 		on the other hand you know it the ironic thing about this is that there's
 		nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than a first generation immigrant
 		so there's uh uh there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in
 	
 	
 		but there's some differences in the immigrants
 		that that we're getting now well in i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration
 	
 	
 		right
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i think probably your your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into America
 		uh they they don't bother to learn our language
 		and uh  first of all they've they've i'm sorry this i really feel strongly about this we send a lot of money to Mexico
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
