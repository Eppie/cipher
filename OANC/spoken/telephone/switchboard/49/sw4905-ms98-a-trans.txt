 
     		
 	
 		okay  uh i just currently
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		quit my job and so
 		
 
 		i really don't receive any benefits right now
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but my husband does and um
 		i think one of the um my first of all always salary and second the second thing is um because we have children so it'd be um
 		health benefits and medical benefits and and um right now we have
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		probably some excellent benefits right now we have with Aetna and uh i don't know if you're familiar with them but we're real happy with them
 	
 	
 		yeah yes i've had a variety of different jobs with of various types um in the computer field and so seen a variety of different types of benefits um i've worked for for  for awhile and
 		they are you know really um an academic type of place and then i've worked with regular you know industry type places and then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff so i've seen a wide range of
 		both you know nonsalary type benefits and other stuff you know like health care that's either fully or partially paid and
 		you know some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much of other types of benefits and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so yeah i would i'd say health care is way up there especially for anybody with kids um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's one of the big things that we always look at you know when we when i think about taking changing jobs is you know
 		you know what kind of health care they have and does the company pay for it you know all or partially or how does that work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um also um vacation time too is a is a big one for me
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um and i guess support for whatever whatever other you know kinds of professional activities you have at you know work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um because i've been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any
 	
 	
 		hm
 		right
 	
 	
 		and some that sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though so that's not so bad um you know it's kind of a give and take kind of thing i think
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i say that uh health care is probably definitely number one though uh you can wind up just losing you know losing all your salary can't can't even begin to pay for what you can wind up losing you know with a major illness or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		right
 		um and and and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices
 		and who to go with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that really helped us out a great deal
 		so
 		but my husband does get vacation and it's worked out really good for us too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so  but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah flexible hours are are pretty important to me as well um because that makes a big difference my wife works part time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she works um as a assistant manager in a fabric store and so she works a lot of evenings and weekends
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so two days a week i um manage to get home early enough to meet the kids from the bus  because she works you know goes in early those days and works like you know noon till close
 		um so we have
 	
 	
 		well that's great that y'all can work that out that's really good
 	
 	
 		yeah and being on a you know rigid schedule wouldn't there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too because i mean usually you know you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time you know and even if it's summer sometimes you get home so late that there's you know you can't do anything with them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and especially in the winter i mean you get get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know it's like it's like a vampire sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah it's that same with my husband because he's got pretty flexible hours if
 		as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do with that's
 		worked out really well for us too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		well is there anything else that you look for or
 	
 	
 		um a lot of it to i guess is
 	
 	
 		you hit pretty you put a lot of the main points in
 	
 	
 		yeah i think some it is how the uh
 		you know i guess it's not really a direct benefit but how you um performance is rated and stuff like that at work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i've been uh especially in large corporations you can really you know wind up getting
 		having you know real problems i've found out i've worked for a few you know several thousand plus  you know type companies
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it especially if you're doing like professional work where there you know it's kind of
 		ethereal as to what you're doing you know if you're like i've i work with uh computer systems a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of hard to say you know if you're a you know brick layer somebody can
 		look and see you know well yeah you laid you know fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didn't fall down  you know yeah you did a great job
 		if you build computer systems like well you know what does that computer program really do you know or if especially if you write like papers you know or do design studies or something it's real hard to rate something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's like being a painter or you know or something an artist it's like well jeez how do you really rate you know Michelangelo  you know how would you tell if he was you know really good or  so-so or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and that does make want a person want to stay
