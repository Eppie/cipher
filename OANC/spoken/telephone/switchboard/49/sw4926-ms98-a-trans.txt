 
     		
 	
 		i kind of think the probably the biggest political topic that i can think of at this point
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is probably the Ross Perot uh candidacy uh i think that that has some interesting uh effects to it at this point with the uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		level of um
 		uh outrage outrage that the public seems to have the voting public seems to have with the existing candidates out there and i think that uh
 		that is certainly something that we haven't seen to this level before
 	
 	
 		right well they've been independent candidates before but uh never
 		as as as popular as he seems to be and i mean it seems to be um doesn't really matter who who it is it's just that fact that he's not in either party
 		that uh seems to be why he's so popular i guess
 	
 	
 		what's your view on
 		big political issues
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um
 		well if we i i i mean sticking with this topic um
 		i would just say that you know it's it's interesting that it doesn't really seem to matter what um what his views are you know i mean he seems to have some views which are pretty conservative and which are pretty liberal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		but it it seems like people are more interested in just the fact that he's an alternative you know than to um
 		to what what you know it i i guess he hasn't really outlined a platform yet you know and people keep asking him you know what what do you feel uh is the best a plan to deal with the budget or blah blah blah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um he really doesn't have any answers i guess but that doesn't stop his popularity from swelling you know people are just sick and tired of um everyone else i guess
 		it seems to be i don't know it's kind of like um people always
 		people always blame you know they always say how can  uh-oh  dogs outside um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		people always  say how how can these politicians be in power and stuff but i guess they forget that they're the ones who put them there in the first place you know
 		they're always they're always trying to find third third alternatives like um
 		you know uh limiting limiting number of years in office for instance
 		but you know all they have to do is vote him out of office you know it's almost like they want to be forced to vote the way that they
 		could in any case you know what i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it seems strange
 	
 	
 		it's it's going to be interesting to see if he uh actually you know we hear the complaints about uh voter apathy and and the whole the whole shebang about throw the bums out
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right
 	
 	
 		it and it it usually you know it's a big deal until election day comes around and then it you know it fizzles out and we end up with the same people
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and uh you have to wonder whether is this going to be something that uh is really going to result in
 	
 	
 		
  
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um a mass turnout of the current people that we have in there or whether this is just going to be another of the same old well throw the bums out but not my bum you know
 	
 	
 		right right as long as he brings pork back  my state then um what what do you think his
 		chances are what do you think uh how much of the vote do you think he's going to get and do you think he will take it more from the Republicans or the Democrats
 	
 	
 		well the media media keeps saying that he's supposed to drain it away from the Democrats but i know that there's a lot of Democrats that don't like Bill Clinton
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm one of them i'm not happy with Bill Clinton at all uh but
 		i you know i'm concerned more concerned about Democrats saying they're unhappy with Bill Clinton and then they go and vote for Ross Perot and then we basically split any protest vote
 		against against Bush more or less in half you know i mean you're dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more years and you know for me that's not a going to be a wonderful uh feeling
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		right
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		i think it'll be interesting to see um whether it turns out he gets more than twenty percent of the vote if that um i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		personally i have a i have a problem with
 		with electing someone who's that rich  um i mean they're all that rich anyway but but someone who's advertised as that rich i don't know i it i kind of
 		um have problems seeing what he and i would have in common you know
 	
 	
 		yeah but i you know it'll be interesting i i don't i agree that i don't think that
