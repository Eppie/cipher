 
     		
 	
 		ready so what do you think do we spend too much on the space program or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i think they ought to spend uh i don't think they ought to spend overly spend on it but uh i don't see anything wrong with you know having a pretty good budget for it because uh
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		heck i don't know i don't i think maybe one day they will uh find a good use for it you know maybe they haven't all that much yet uh other than the little things they've developed in this space shuttle
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the little experiments that they've done and so forth you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in uh i know they asked the question uh would you go if you had the chance and i'd go tomorrow
 	
 	
 		yeah we could
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		if i had a chance
 	
 	
 		oh you're an adventurer huh
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		what makes it what makes it so exciting for you
 	
 	
 		well i don't know i just it would be something i've never experienced before weightlessness i'd love to experience weightlessness that's something i've always uh thought would be fascinating you know
 	
 	
 		yeah that that'd be fun that'd be a lot of fun
 		uh-huh
 		that's true yeah i'd i'd have to i'd think once or twice but i think i'd probably do it just for the experience i  guess but it'd be pretty interesting that's for sure
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think so
 		when they had the uh accident you know back the space shuttle accident and i thought well maybe i won't go  you know but uh since then i thought well what the heck i'd go if it would be a one time once in lifetime experience i'd try it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		oh yeah you couldn't couldn't pass it up that's for sure
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so
 	
 	
 		you think it'll ever happen where they'll let it'll be common or
 	
 	
 		uh it might it it very well may uh i think it's sort a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		had a setback because of that accident and uh and sometimes i get really disappointed because they have so many delays when they have a launch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and everything i think gee you know they'll never get this worked out it just seems like they they delay it more and more every time they have a launch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't know you know they seems like they sort of bog down they're not really progressing right now to me
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm kind of anxious to see what they do with this uh uh this space station they're talking about  you know i think that'd be  a step to where you know in the right direction but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah well i believe that uh they'll eventually make it to Mars you know maybe not in our lifetime but uh you know if this world is still here  at that time i think they'll i think they'll eventually do that
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah i'd uh just the way we progress i i like i say i'd hate to see them cut out the the  budget there's a lot of places
 		you know that can use it but  just you know simple things like Teflon stuff like that all came from the Apollo mission  yeah things they developed
 	
 	
 		right
 		is that right i didn't realize that
 	
 	
 		you know
 		in that program you know i mean mean mean just common everyday things that we take for granted but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know that's as an offshoot it's kind of like the military budget you know there's a lot of things we use because they put so much money in the military
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		that we end up using just a you know everyday stuff but something like that Teflon something you take for granted you use it every day but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		if it hadn't of been for something like that you'd never you know really not have got it so
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's true that's true and i guess they've got a lot of uh they've done a lot of medical tests
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh in space too and uh i mean i don't know what they've they've actually come up with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i know that medicine is another
 		area that they used that they've used in space a lot you know
 	
 	
 		well they said yeah
 		uh-huh they say in you know in weightlessness they're they're able to do a lot of different things with the chemicals and minerals that they can't do with the gravity so
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		there could be some valuable i guess there's a shuttle going up tomorrow as far as i
 	
 	
 		is that no i don't even know about that
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's
 		they've been a little concerned because it's kind of chilly it's cold you know like you say so they're worried about the
 	
 	
 		oh  yeah the the the ice
 	
 	
 		same thing that happened to the Challenger but they are going up to do some tests with some organisms uh organisms and stuff and weightlessness to see how they uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how they react to that and everything but so i think i think you're right though they're getting little better and better sooner sooner you know sooner or later they're going to make some major breakthroughs
 	
 	
 		right to the weightlessness yeah
 		i think i think they'll work it out eventually yeah like you say it will be a major breakthrough right now they're sort of
 		sort of sitting still but i think eventually it will uh they'll it will come to them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah it's just a matter of time i guess nothing ever comes without nothing ever comes without some effort so
 	
 	
 		that's right well you know talking about the weightlessness i've uh i've uh noticed that they've talked about like these Russian astronauts stay up there for nearly a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know they have a lot of problems with the i'm not sure what it is with the the muscle muscle tone and so forth because they uh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		they have been weightless so long and then they course they exercise but it's not the same as exercising with gravity and the i i'm not sure exactly
 	
 	
 		oh really i hadn't heard that
 	
 	
 		what the deal was but there were some problems with long term weightlessness
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and they were trying to figure out how to solve that problem if they were planning on going to Mars because you know it would be a real long term talking about a couple of years i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 		so it was just that their muscles weren't as well toned as they started or
 	
 	
 		i i'm not sure if it was tone or exactly what it was but i i remember they had a lot of problems with their uh when when they got back to Earth uh walking you know they walk they couldn't walk very well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 		huh
 	
 	
 		when they finally made it back into gravity and uh i'm not sure exactly why that was you know i mean it was because of the weightlessness but i'm not sure physiologically what happened
 	
 	
 		yeah
