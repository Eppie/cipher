 
     		
 	
 		do you use credit cards
 	
 	
 		
 
 		convenience uh
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		i i use them for just uh everything mostly i confine my credit card to just one MasterCard
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		but um i i carry it with me and clutch it tightly to my bosom at all times fortunately um
 		uh i have a credit card well i have a two MasterCards one
 		uh has a twenty dollar it's a gold MasterCard and it uh have to pay a twenty dollar annual fee but as long as i i pay off every month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's no interest charge
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		but and we never carry over we pay off every month
 	
 	
 		what is the advantage then of a gold card because um you don't pay any interest if you have a regular MasterCard or Visa
 	
 	
 		well one thing is whenever we rent a car we don't have to pay um any extra insurance
 		so that we uh my husband's uh family lives in New Hampshire
 		and uh
 		it's about ninety miles from Hartford and ninety miles to Boston
 		so uh as a general rule when he goes up there he rents a car
 		so the times of the year that he rents a car more than pays the twenty dollar annual fee for having a gold card
 	
 	
 		i see
 		i see we used to get the American Express card and
 		stuff like that and then we just kind of got back to plain old MasterCard and Visa uh because we never really had any um
 		benefit that we thought was worth the the price of the special card so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it may change you know if we do a lot of car rental which we don't do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or other types of services i'm sure there're some things that come along with the gold cards that are appealing and and uh i've just wondered what they were they haven't been appealing to us so far
 	
 	
 		no uh unless there's some no i there's no uh unless there's some advantage there's not any point there's there's no prestige factor involved
 	
 	
 		yeah that you know i think that was my original appeal uh i was i was in my twenties and the American Express card really appeals to people on that basis of of you know you've arrived you've got this card
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you know it got to what fifty five dollars a year or something like that and my wife said well this is ridiculous why are we doing this and uh
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we stopped doing it and we refused to pay i don't know whether you know this but my wife discovered this we started to refuse to pay our banks uh an annual fee for the that for the Visa Visa and MasterCard  and they said fine we'll give it to you anyway
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we said you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we're uh we're not interested in your card anymore and they said well wait a minute is is it the price and we said yeah so well we won't charge anymore  you know and they used to charge what eighteen dollars a year or something like that twelve dollars something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		they're wonderful i mean i think credit cards are great we use it to get cash uh you know you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San Francisco and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		it's wonderful in that respect and we're glad to have them we we
 	
 	
 		can can you buy groceries with it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's great you know and it eventually what we're gonna go to is nothing but these kinds of cards and it'll be MasterCard Visa and and American Express i don't think the Discover card's gonna make it in the long term
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um you know we don't need too many cards and and the American Express will probably survive but it'll have to become more like these other ones and become cheaper i think because the price will come down
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so too
 	
 	
 		i don't think it's worth fifty five bucks a year
 	
 	
 		no it's not
 	
 	
 		when you can use the the Visa or the MasterCard everywhere in the world and they're pitching that in all their commercials i notice
 	
 	
 		yeah you really can and uh also um
 		we travel abroad
 		some
 		and um it um you get MasterCard's accepted everywhere and and you get the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a a good rate you get a better rate than you do uh cashing in traveler's checks of course there are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well now now that's interesting i can see why because then they get some sort of advantage in terms of the  conversion fee probably
 	
 	
 		yeah and and even uh converting your traveler's checks at a bank they still charge you a fee
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		well it it's gonna come that way and the reason it's nice is because basically what it does is put you electronically in touch with your financial resources
 		anywhere in the world and that's where we're headed  the technology supports that nicely
 		and uh it makes more sense than than that because you have a card and if you have insurance which we have had on the card you uh can have you can lose it stolen
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you don't get uh anything charged to you and that's great it's just insurance we're very responsible with our cards but nonetheless if we lost them
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it'd be great to know we didn't have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um on the cards we look for the low rate we have USAA cards uh you know USAA
 	
 	
 		yeah we do too
 	
 	
 		yeah but but USAA is Dallas based and uh  that's a great thing for
