 
     		
 	
 		okay have you had to return anything lately that you've bought
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		um  no not really i uh i may have had to have a
 		a few minor repairs but i haven't bought anything of any consequences other than clothes and things and i will be in the very near future i'm gonna be buying a big computer and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um  one of these eight millimeter camcorders
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that'll be nice
 	
 	
 		so i been i been studying these things but uh i haven't had to return too many things i
 	
 	
 		i haven't either really
 	
 	
 		i i i try to be very careful when i pick up something and and look it over to make sure that it looks like it's going to to work
 	
 	
 		right right well i think it's gotten easier nowadays if you have something and you have to return it most most places are willing to you know go with the customer
 	
 	
 		and
 		i think it really turns down to
 		picking who you want to buy from and i hate to say it but the field electronics devices that i buy the the ones in Japan in generally
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		are much higher quality from working
 	
 	
 		on uh yeah i know that i know
 	
 	
 		i mean i hate to admit it but it's true they they they have a higher percentage of uh completely working models that get out to the public
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true i haven't had to return anything that i can think of but uh you know with like radios and things they've become so cheap that even if they do break it's better just to go get another one than have it fixed
 	
 	
 		you that's right you you were speaking of that about a week ago i bought myself a new digital watch
 	
 	
 		you know
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that was made in China
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		works just fine and it cost me four dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah uh the stuff like that you know
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yes it's amazing isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah and i you know like television and stereos and things they're a lot cheaper if they're Japanese made
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know i've i've gotten to the point where i think so but um i've had to return um i think a television one time and um
 		uh the color went out but and it was like a month later and i didn't have any problem whatsoever which i think is good but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know years ago you didn't never have to return anything everything worked for so long
 	
 	
 		that's right and and and that's been really um way it's been for me for the last five or six years that i returned a TV set to be repaired but the problem was that uh we had a a lightning storm and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		the lightning flashed in through the power and uh hurt something in it so it wasn't the set's fault at all it was just uh one of those circumstances
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's not bad at all well this is the first time i've ever gotten anybody outside of Texas
 	
 	
 		no
 		well i tell you most of my talks are in Texas that's true i but i've been i've been uh talked into um  California twice in the last uh week or two
 	
 	
 		really
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so it's uh it's nice but but i know how it is if you're gonna take care of Texas you have to live in Texas i suppose
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
 
 		
  
 		oh my heavens but let's see um i can't think of any other products i've taken back
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um clothes is about mainly what i've you know gotten lately and i think they've gone downhill
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as as far as unless you it's you get what you pay for
 	
 	
 		well we're being filled up with a lot of
 		of stores that have huge quantities of of uh clothes and articles and you know we've got Wal-Marts and Gee Gee Bees and a whole bunch of things and
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know how we can support all of those things and the and and the only way they can stay alive is to buy cheaper products so they can put them on the market cheaper for the public
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		right
 	
 	
 		and when that happens more of those products are likely to have uh inferior working ability and that's when you have to start returning them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i agree with you it's kind of hard for the small man
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to make it you know with the the homemade thing
 	
 	
 		that's right and i i i have a friend who does make uh beautiful furniture but he has to charge twice as much when you go to a store
 	
 	
 		you know
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		if it looks beautiful and it's well made but people can't afford it
 	
 	
 		
  
 		wow that's pretty interesting
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		hum
 		let me think of something else here
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		um i can't that's the only thing i can think of is clothes you know and and they're going up so high if you want a well made you know piece of clothing
 		or in matter of fact furniture also you know you have to go you have to pay a lot more it's the old adage you get get what you pay for
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but um you know and you can get oh i know i bought a real cheap couch one time and it looked good but it was cheap and it didn't last very long you know
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		i think the frame of it wasn't really good because it was probably mass produced
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		actually i had some uh i bought a water softener for my home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i didn't have to return it but it didn't work well and i finally i finally had to have the company come out and to check it out so i did have that problem
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and it was a matter i think it was more of the installation was part of the problem than the machine itself
 	
 	
 		do you have a problem with your water heater
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		if you
