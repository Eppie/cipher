 
		
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				
 				so the question is how do we keep up with current events
 			
 			
 				current events you take a newspaper
 			
 			
 				as a matter of fact as you called i was uh taking a look at uh the San Francisco Examiner
 			
 			
 				is that right is that how you usually keep up on the news
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				uh i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour fairly regularly and uh the network news less often
 			
 			
 				uh-huh
 			
 			
 				and will watch some of the talking heads programs on PBS
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				uh and that's pretty much about it we don't get Time or Newsweek um
 				and uh as a matter of fact i don't get any of those sort of of magazines anymore
 			
 			
 				yeah i don't either it's mostly by the news but mine is mostly mostly mostly just like the six o'clock news or eleven o'clock is usually about the time i'm ready to look at TV
 			
 			
 				yeah do you watch the network news
 			
 			
 				uh yeah some
 			
 			
 				yeah out here they're moving it to a seven o'clock uh well they're moving the prime time schedule up from
 				uh eight to eleven which used to be eight o'clock at night till eleven o'clock at night now to seven to ten
 			
 			
 				oh
 			
 			
 				and i guess the network news which has moved up in time out here
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				um will move up on all three of the local network affiliates
 			
 			
 				huh
 			
 			
 				i was just reading as a matter of fact about the news coverage of the movie JFK have you have you seen
 			
 			
 				yeah that's had a lot of publicity hasn't it
 			
 			
 				yeah it's really interesting to listen to how different people  uh approach different topics um
 				it the i didn't realize this but uh Dan Rather at CBS was the first person to view this Zapruder film that was actually made of the assassination
 			
 			
 				uh-huh
 			
 			
 				and he had viewed it the day after and uh got it completely backwards in terms of what had happened that was significant because of the obvious contention that there were two gunmen at least and not one
 				and uh it's really interesting and he Rather wrote later admitted that he'd gotten the key piece of uh uh evidence backwards that he'd argued like a lot of other people that Kennedy had lurched forward
 				after the shot and he'd in fact been uh forced backward which lends credence to the two
 			
 			
 				right
 			
 			
 				uh to the two gunmen conspiracy theory have you seen the movie
 			
 			
 				i haven't seen it
 			
 			
 				i haven't either
 			
 			
 				but it sure will be interesting to see how see it once i do figure out what all the controversy's about
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				it is uh you know i uh are you one of those people who believes that it was uh not a lone gunman that that we just never really got the full story
 			
 			
 				yeah i don't think we got the full story but i don't you know i haven't seen the movie so i don't really have an opinion about what he had to say yet
 			
 			
 				yeah i i haven't seen the movie either but i i think most of us in this country believe that it just doesn't make sense that it was one guy
 			
 			
 				right
 			
 			
 				and uh
 			
 			
 				but who was involved that's i guess that's the story to tell huh
 			
 			
 				well that's what Oliver Stone's seeking to do and i i think it's really interesting to look at this because i think it kind of gets at the question of how people get their news sometimes
 				uh really important news comes to people through movies
 			
 			
 				yeah just like this years later maybe
 			
 			
 				through television
 				yeah and and i think that's really interesting i know that um uh my wife and i were talking about
 				how uh much uh attitudes toward women uh and and the relationships between men and women husband's and wives uh are changing and i think people get more of that information
 				through television sitcoms than they do through reading the newspaper
 			
 			
 				that's probably exactly right
 			
 			
 				uh that was the topic of yesterday's T I conversation and and uh i think it's really interesting because i think all of those things wind up carrying the message and i think uh um
 				it's gonna be real interesting to see where we go with all of the selective channels that people are going to be able to get via cable television and computer services
 			
 			
 				right
 			
 			
 				so much uh so much more than we can possibly consume in the way of news
 			
 			
 				that's right
 				that's right so what brought you to San Francisco have you
 			
 			
 				um i came up here i was uh working for uh a unit of AT&T and was promoted i came out to California to go to graduate school and and was hired out of the PhD program um in southern California
 				and went to work for a unit of AT&T and they promoted me and moved me up here and we liked it my my wife is from San Diego
 			
 			
 				did
 				did are you living right in San Francisco then
 			
 			
 				live uh right out by the park right uh right off uh Lindley Meadow in Golden Gate Park
 			
 			
 				oh well you're right in the middle of things then aren't you
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				yeah what took you to Texas
 			
 			
 				a job
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				my brother lived out here and he and my dad owned a little trucking company and they asked my husband to come and run it
 			
 			
 				oh yeah
 			
 			
 				but we lived in Concord for several years before that
 				and he grew up over there in San Mateo so we know that
 			
 			
 				uh-huh and you grew up in Walnut Creek yeah how long have you been in Texas
 			
 			
 				right
 				so we
 				um about nine years now
 			
 			
 				that's do you like it
 			
 			
 				i do i really like it
 			
 			
 				that's a i i hear a lot of good things about Texas
 			
 			
 				yeah i really like it
 			
 			
 				it's big it's probably more affordable housing it's
 			
 			
 				boy that's for sure  you can't even uh i mean it's not even fathomable that
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				i well i the the we live yeah living here it's just it's
