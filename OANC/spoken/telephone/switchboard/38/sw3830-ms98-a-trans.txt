 		oh sure
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		where are you calling from or where are you at
 	
 	
 		Arlington Arlington Texas yes
 	
 	
 		Arlington well there's a
 		lot of
 		stuff going on in Arlington these days
 	
 	
 		yes not all good stuff
 	
 	
 		are you involved in any of that no
 	
 	
 		no no i'm not not personally
 	
 	
 		well uh what benefits uh do now do you work
 	
 	
 		i'm going to school right now i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what i think i've got a lot of
 	
 	
 		oh you are
 		okay
 		yeah because i i work for myself and so uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh there's a lot that i that i guess i do miss uh a lot  of benefits from working for a big corporation i miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come but uh
 	
 	
 		yes right
 		yes
 		yes i've been in my own business Mary Kay in fact i'm selling it out now to go to school for a turn and i enjoyed the freedom of having
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		that you know go to work when i wanted to and not but you know the benefits weren't there so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i uh  i own part of a roofing company
 	
 	
 		oh do you yeah
 	
 	
 		in the in the Dallas Fort Worth area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger company and they uh you know we  we had all the benefits there and and i do miss that you know but uh on the other hand i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		i enjoy having the the time that i have with my family and
 	
 	
 		right
 		yep um-hum
 	
 	
 		being able to you know work when i want and
 	
 	
 		i think today the thing that i uh
 		would appreciate the most uh because my husband gets his medical through his company but we have to pay for mine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we're the only one that i'm the only one that's being insured
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children have i mean so it's kind of and i would i really and the way medical expenses are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's a
 	
 	
 		i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to have you need to have
 	
 	
 		yeah it really probably it yeah i'll tell you what that is the single most uh benefit that i that i
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		enjoyed and i do miss because i looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just
 		and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it
 	
 	
 		it's out of sight right it's out of sight
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah
 	
 	
 		even at a group rate i couldn't believe how much is our
 	
 	
 		oh yeah even at a group rate uh it's it's unbelievable and uh the amount that you have to pay for you know for kids and and if you want to add dental to it i mean that's
 	
 	
 		right it goes up right
 	
 	
 		that eats even more so  yeah i guess what the other benefits that uh
 		that i uh that i miss i guess is uh you know some of the
 		bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company you know and course these days you can't count on that because
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know i feel bad for the people that are involved in that uh
 		GM deal there in in Arlington and i'm i'm sure it'll be you know quite a few people are affected by that so
 	
 	
 		right
 		right it's going to hurt the city although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank and i would see the GM people come in when they were they would shut down to retool
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they were paid that whole time and i don't know if you're aware of this right yes
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		they come in there just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and
 		every Friday and go to the safety deposit box and i'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know and they had all these great i i really believe they have done this to themselves
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		in a way because of the unions being so strong
 	
 	
 		the Union yeah
 	
 	
 		and right now anybody that's laid off from GM will have a full year's paycheck
 		i just read this in the paper the other day plus probably an additional six months through the the worker's stuff that they have at
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		at uh through the company so i'm sorry you know i'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt but i don't feel as sorry for them if my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check and that would be it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well really the
 		yeah really the ones it's gonna hurt is is actually the the businesses around in that area you know that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that uh
 	
 	
 		yes oh yeah that's already hurting yeah
 		but i think there's a case where benefits have gotten they voted them in and they got so good i mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it made the prices of cars go up and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know the i we i believe in unions but they went too far
 	
 	
 		well i tell you i  i've had my fill of unions  i use
 	
 	
 		i mean i can't make eighteen dollars an hour
 		i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
