 
     		
 	
 		how many children do you have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i have one child a little girl who's eighteen months old
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um okay
 		we've got one he's uh thirteen weeks yesterday
 	
 	
 		oh wow congratulations
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		actually even though our daughter is a year and a half we just got her last July we adopted a little girl from Beijing
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		from Beijing
 	
 	
 		uh yeah my wife is also Chinese
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		my my wife is Chinese
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so we um traveled to Beijing and we adopted her and so we're
 		she's just at a playful age right now we just do a lot of things play with her and take her to a park of course can't right now it's too cold to go out too much here it's been really cold
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		it's not not real toasty here either but i imagine it's a good deal colder in Iowa
 	
 	
 		yeah uh although we were gone for most of our Christmas and we had a nice time in in California for our vacation visiting family
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		is that where you're from originally
 	
 	
 		no that's where my wife's from and we also visited Seattle where i'm from
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and
 		so
 		we just love mainly we we like to spend time playing games and
 		um
 		just she's sort of at a playful age teaching her new words things like that
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		right now uh our son's just uh dealing with grunts and squeaks and grinning and crying and
 	
 	
 		yeah so yeah your your activities probably consist of staying up at night um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		actually no he sleeps real well at night
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		he'll he he generally sleeps through the night uh he'll go down about till well he don't doesn't go down till about ten ten thirty which is a little tough when you got a lot of studying to do but uh
 		he'll uh he won't get up till like six o'clock uh somewhere between six and eight in the morning
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		he'll be ravenously hungry by then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he's truly a jolly little fellow and sleeps through the night too which is a real blessing
 		uh it it took about the first four weeks before he started that
 		which i don't think it was quite coincidental but he started sleeping through the night about the time we took him out of our bed and put him in a crib in in the next room
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		suddenly he started sleeping through the night almost consistently
 	
 	
 		well we found that was important too for sleeping through the night um having um their their own room
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in fact it was almost trained out of our daughter during vacation where at our parents' house where it's just um one room for all of us our daughter and us um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the first few nights back she was terrified to be in the room by herself but now she's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sleeping through the night again so
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		um we
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		my wife um
 		is we also other things we're trying trying to do um um
 		is potty train our our girl a year and a half that's a little some people think that's a little bit early but um
 		she was the foster parents our friends in China who had taken care of her before we could get her um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		have a Chinese generally potty train their children a little bit earlier earlier and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um we're having spend some time with that also
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		and
 	
 	
 		that's got to be a a lot of fun
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'd
 		she doesn't enjoy it that much but um she's learning slowly but surely
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah uh uh it's you know
 	
 	
 		we have a little book it talks about giving rewards and so it's a pleasant experience and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well they they the children are gonna to eventually training wind up training themselves but
 		um they can be trained into it pretty early too
 		so  i remember some of the strange potty training experiences when i we were growing up amongst brothers and sisters
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we're almost kind of not looking forward to that
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah but there's a lot of we we're just having lots of fun with with our little girl right now um she has lots of toys got little
 	
 	
 		anyway
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she especially likes the little telephone and the little tyke bike that she has
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um and then reading she likes us to to go through the books you know and she could say a few word you know she could learning to say the names of you know a lot of simple animals and um
 		and the you know the sounds that they make
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		like duck says quack
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and doggy says ruff things like that
 		so that's about her
 		her stage right now and she's running around she she started
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good
 	
 	
 		when we first adopted her we she she wasn't walking yet but she was soon walking within a couple weeks after that and now she's running all
 	
 	
 		yeah
