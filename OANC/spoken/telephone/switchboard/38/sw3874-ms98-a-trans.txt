 
     		
 	
 		how do you get most of your news
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's a a good question um
 		i read the newspaper obviously and and watch TV
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		what are your favorites on TV for for news programs
 	
 	
 		uh we have one here at at at six o'clock in the evening to seven where we have local news  followed by uh
 		and i i i can't name the  CBS i guess it is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		who is who is the gentleman that uh
 		MC's that program
 	
 	
 		uh  that's terrible i know i should know these but is Dan Rather
 		C B S
 	
 	
 		yeah i think in fact i think it's Dan Rather yeah i i i have uh been just retired recently so i have had very little time really to watch
 		TV and uh to get the news so all of my time that was available was between about six and seven uh obviously i scan the newspaper
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i think
 	
 	
 		are you one of those people that tends to like to go through the paper first thing in the morning over coffee or breakfast or something or do you tend to like to read at the end of the day
 	
 	
 		no
 		i get mine at the end of the day
 	
 	
 		yes that's the way i am
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i at least i used to and now i'm beginning to read it about noon  since i just retired i i retired from Penn State and i just uh now i have some morning time available
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		and it used to be that we got our newspapers in the evening which i liked because that's when i could read it and i felt like it was fresh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and for the last two or three years our newspapers have been coming early in the morning and it's been six or seven o'clock at night before i got to read it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i had already heard all kinds of conflicting things during the day before i read a newspaper
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		
 
 		sometimes it feels as though what i'm reading in the newspaper is the old news it's as if i heard it just the day before on the television and i wonder where they get a lot of their stories but i think that
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		the one that i'm i feel like i get the most information from is is uh McNeil Lehrer and sometimes it's on in the afternoon if i'm if i'm home but i work most the time so um
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the program in San Francisco is on from six to seven which is ideal because
 	
 	
 		well that's my normal time six to seven for here
 	
 	
 		yes you're preparing dinner but you still have an opportunity to to look at it occasionally we have a little two year old so there's not a lot of time to for me i feel to spend as much time with the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		updates as i'd like to i think i probably get more of it from Lee because he works out of our home and um
 		can give me information about what might've happened that day if he watched the afternoon McNeill Lehrer
 	
 	
 		how do you feel about the authenticity of these various uh methods of presenting of representing the news
 	
 	
 		it it seems to me that McNeil Lehrer spends more time with each issue therefore i can count on it being more accurate uh because they've really spent more
 		development of the story as well as research and
 		and i get a better picture of what it is that i'm hearing about i i wonder about the authenticity of the others um i i have a feeling they get a lot from UPI and AP and maybe they count on what they get from those reporters and
 		just give little spots to it and
 	
 	
 		yes  i always wonder about the accuracy of their source of information that's what bothers me particularly you know when we're had this business of the of the war over there in Europe i mean i always wondered about
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it that they based what they said on whoever told them well whoever told them might not necessarily have the accurate news and know of the overall know the overall
 	
 	
 		right and certainly in that situation there was an effort to exclude the press from some activities because they didn't want to have a lot of political fall out i think but there was probably
 	
 	
 		story
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some repetition of of stories that didn't have complete um confirmation i wondered that about the whole Clinton thing recently um you know something coming out in the tabloids and being picked up by a major media
 		uh one of the accusations obviously is that they didn't go down there and research it and and get enough information i don't have a preference or an opinion really on that story one way or the other but it's uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's clear that there's a lot of controversy about it
 	
 	
 		well then the the only thing that you can be sure of the uh has gotten it straight from the horse so to speak is did you hear uh President Bush's speech the other night
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well at least we know what he said
 	
 	
 		
 
 		this is true
 	
 	
 		and we we don't have to to uh read in the newspaper what they think he said or what the Democrats think he said we know what we heard him say
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh  but it is always interesting to hear the follow ups you know on any kind of major presentation you always get the analysis
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's when you find out of all the disturbances that are in the background that know one else knows about that's the problem when you're in a politics
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's always somebody working behind your back and who just doesn't want you to get your way simply because you're on the other team well that's ridiculous really
 	
 	
 		well they all have their perceptions too you know they may have heard the exact same thing and that's just their
 	
 	
 		yeah yep
