 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well how polluted do you think we are down here
 	
 	
 		uh well i guess we're not as bad as a lot of places but uh we're out here on the Great Plains so there's some place for it to go
 	
 	
 		i think so
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i guess so and it's still a little bit flat around here and there's no specific mountains to hem it in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh we used to live in California and although we were not in the smoggy area of Los Angeles we used to visit down there and honestly you could
 		you could you could see the smog hanging over the city it's just about uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard that
 	
 	
 		yes we can and a friend of mine lives out in San Bernardino
 		and uh uh just beyond San Bernardino
 		is the desert and separating San Bernardino from the desert are some mountain ranges and when the smog gets very very bad in Los Angeles it moves out there and then is bounded
 		by that mountain range and literally hangs over San Bernardino
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's a very very strange thing
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's probably the problem with any of the coastal cities i think that's what New York has such a problem with
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah although you know
 	
 	
 		you know the the the way that the air masses move around the the sea coast uh and it really just like making and stuff just hang over whatever cities happen to be on the coast
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		
 
 		i i do think that's what's one of the real problems although i grew up in New York and i never noticed this kind of pollution as i i saw in uh you know southern California
 	
 	
 		i don't think it's as bad yeah
 	
 	
 		and then um-hum
 	
 	
 		i know there's some because in my visits to New York i noticed that my i wear i'm a contact lens wearer and i noticed that i have to uh take out my contacts
 	
 	
 		yes um-hum
 		oh
 		clean them
 	
 	
 		yeah i can't wear them as many hours during the day as i can other places but you know i mean that's not just New York i mean that's also Europe you know Rome is the worst city i've ever been at
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 		um-hum
 		uh
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		course now i hear that uh you now like Mexico City is real bad for that
 	
 	
 		oh i see well i've never been down there
 	
 	
 		and also places in Brazil like Sao Paulo you know
 	
 	
 		is that right well what are they doing down there that causes such a thing what kind of industries do they have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well they have no they have no pollution controls whatsoever
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		so whatever industry they do have even though they don't have as much as we have they just like fire away you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i see um
 	
 	
 		they control nothing i mean it's like it's like you know the situation it you know Brazil even though there's there's in Brazil uh it it's my understanding because i have some friends there that are Brazilian
 		uh there's an upper-class and a lower-class and no middle-class
 	
 	
 		oh i see um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so you know the lower class is working uh in the factories which pollute the air and the upper classes make the money off of the factories
 	
 	
 		um-hum um
 		oh i see uh-huh um
 	
 	
 		and so pollution is a big problem for all of the you know underdeveloped countries because they're not going to they're not going to start instituting regulations that are going to impede their whatever industry they happen to have
 	
 	
 		um
 		profits i guess
 		um-hum yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which you know  that's  kind of going to be the end result you know Bush i was reading in the Wall Street Journal today you know Bush's moratorium on regulatory
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh things right now that are going to impede business the first effect that it has had is the EPA had some new regs up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for um congressional approval that had to do with making industries uh itemize uh different types of things that they were you know
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		putting into the air you know part of the clean air act you know which is to help enforce the clean air act and so that of course you know the moratorium on new regulations has you know hamstrung that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		um-hum
 		that's right uh-huh i i know that
 		a lot of the European countries and Mexico and the South American countries simply do not have the governmental regulations and i think that unless the government is uh
 		on top of this or at least instrumental in trying to do something that nothing is really going to be done by private industry until they you know get that push it really wasn't done in our country
 	
 	
 		absolutely not
 		not any profit driven industry because you know they're just absolutely not going to you know sit still for anything that's going to take away from profits i mean we're we're living in the greed generation here i mean there is no there is
 	
 	
 		you know um um-hum yeah uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh  the greed generation oh what a terrible thing to say  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		sure i mean you know
 		i mean i've heard i've heard that before and i'm now beginning to believe it because
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know what i mean i have some limited involvement in some in some what you would call i guess environmental type entities i'm an attorney and i write letters for a number of environmental um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh i see
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh purposes and you know it it is amazing to me that people can sit here and look at the situation that we have globally and say you know what the hell
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh i know um um-hum
 	
 	
 		because uh you know it's it's really apparent to me especially living in a city the size of Dallas that the wide open spaces that where always the justification for why worry you know are going away
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um
 		oh
