 
     		
 	
 		um Ashley um do you exercise regularly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i do i uh go on long walks whenever i can and uh
 		well when i when i can fit it into my schedule and the weather's right i like to walk uh oh three four miles a day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well that's pretty good i unfortunately uh am not um exercising regularly at the time um
 		i
 		we've recently made a move i used to be at the university where there's facilities there and my wife and i regularly played um racquetball
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um since we've moved to Iowa now um we don't have as many facilities like that um
 	
 	
 		well that sort of same sort of thing happened to me i used to be a regular swimmer i i taught at a university and i you know could use the pool  every day if i wanted and since moving away from the university environment i've uh
 		now it's kind of difficult to find a pool that's convenient and affordable to swim in
 		but uh what university were you at
 	
 	
 		i was at Brigham Young University
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um actually i am working at a university right now i just graduated with my PhD at Brigham Young and i'm working at the University of Iowa however
 		we had all free benefits for faculty and staff and students at Brigham Young but um
 		oh it's we the benefits here as far as um using the physical facilities are not free here so and plus they're not as convenient we're we're further away so it's not as convenient for like my wife to come in you know for doing things together
 	
 	
 		did you say you're at the University of Iowa Iowa City huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i went i visited visited there once quite a few years ago had a friend who was in the linguistics department there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i'm in uh
 		at the National Center for Voice and Speech which is part of the um Department of Speech Pathology
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		well you would do you have contact with any of the uh people in linguistics
 	
 	
 		well uh
 		i just i haven't been here uh uh only for several months and uh i i'm sure that there must be some cooperation between the departments but uh i'm not aware of anything as yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		i
 	
 	
 		well if you ever run into uh to Cathy Reagan say hi to her for me  i think she's still there
 	
 	
 		okay
 		
 
 		okay usually when the temperatures are warmer um i live about twenty minutes from school so um
 		from the university so i often will walk in which i guess it's i'm not sure how far it is um actually it's twenty five minutes and it's probably about a mile i don't know long it's got to be maybe a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well how briskly do you walk do you think how how fast do you walk do you think
 	
 	
 		what
 		oh i walk rather briskly but i don't i don't do it during these winter months it's just far too cold um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well a brisk walker can go maybe what four or five miles an hour so if it takes you a third of an hour to get in you're probably going oh i would say at least a mile and a half probably
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah so anyway i could get a little bit of exercise that way um
 	
 	
 		yeah the winter of course even here in uh in northern Texas we do get a little cold weather but most of the winter i can go walking just about anytime i want to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		this winter though it's rained so much that uh there've been times where see my uh favorite
 		uh area to walk is a a greenbelt they have right through Plano here and uh
 		you know it's it surrounds a little stream over much much of its extent you can walk for miles there and never cross a street you you go under the streets
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh when the uh when the water is too high uh you'd get washed away i mean they have signs up there warning people to stay away so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		we've had that uh a number of times recently not to mention the mud of course
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		well you can get you can do the other thing i do is uh i have a little exercise bike that uh wasn't too expensive i got a cheap one but you can really work up a sweat on it
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah if i were to begin to begin exercise now i think it'd be something that i could do um
 		indoors something that's convenient
 		um
 		you know
 		it's like an exercise bike or something like that although i haven't purchased one purchased one yet sometimes i do i have this little trampoline
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		small type trampoline that i do indoor jogging on sometimes for exercise but i haven't really started been doing anything regular for the last several months since we've since we've moved to to Iowa
 	
 	
 		yeah i i really prefer outdoor exercise i'm afraid that my favorite indoor exercise is eating apple pie a la mode and that doesn't help very much
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well outdoor exercise is uh more convenient however
