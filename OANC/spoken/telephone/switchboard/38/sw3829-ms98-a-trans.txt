 
     		
 	
 		you been doing in your house
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well since Christmas we painted a bedroom and did some wallpapering in there i had to do most of it since uh my wife was working
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		great where do you live
 	
 	
 		uh Austin yeah and getting getting ready around here to do some uh major yard work as soon as the weather turns a little bit nicer
 	
 	
 		Austin okay great
 		well we
 		yeah as soon as soon as it stops raining a little bit huh
 	
 	
 		yeah well actually the past couple days has made me want to get out there and get started but  i figure i'd just be wasting my time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah great have you done much uh much in the way of home repairs
 	
 	
 		uh i've always maintained our homes as far as repairs and things like that except maybe i don't do heaters and air conditioners but
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i usually do everything else right up to replacing dishwashers and things
 	
 	
 		great how old a house do you have
 	
 	
 		uh this house is was built in probably the mid seventies uh it's kind of a brick ranch not a whole lot needs to be done to it we've only we only moved here about a year ago
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah yeah great
 	
 	
 		what about you what kind of house you live in
 	
 	
 		oh well right now we're not we're living in a travel trailer but uh we've we we've just moved here to Dallas uh recently and we're living in that until we can find a place but
 		uh we lived in a brick homes in uh in Louisiana before this and did some uh various kinds of things uh made some storm windows to put up and
 		uh
 		uh really did a major rejob on the inside of the house uh put up some walls and uh put in a bathroom and stuff like that
 		uh
 	
 	
 		about two years ago we bought a house out at Smithville which is like forty miles east of Austin over toward Houston uh little old stucco house built in nineteen twenty one and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		we bought it to for to get for a weekend getaway
 		and it needed a lot of work but we saw it when we first looked at it we can do this and uh sure enough uh it's oh nineteen months later we sold it for twenty six and we bought it for sixteen five
 	
 	
 		wow that's pretty good yeah
 	
 	
 		and we did things like paint uh inside and outside and basically repaired the garages we put in expensive ceiling fans which was kind of dumb on my part but
 		it was something i thought the place needed because it had real high ceilings and uh just and just in general did everything we uh put in a hot water heater a new toilet and things like that kind of remodeled the kitchen cabinets
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum do you think it was worth uh the ceiling fans on your resale
 	
 	
 		well  we weren't think talking about reselling it when we started doing it we were looking for something to do on weekends
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it because my wife loves to pick out paint and experiment and if it doesn't work try another color things like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so but when the offer came to us it was from a neighbor and they wanted their mother close to them and we thought well you know we're not we hadn't been out here but what once in three months and
 		and we had just bought this house in Austin so we thought well what the heck let's make a little money on it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		sure well sounds good you think you'll do it again some time
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd like to uh
 		we have bought new homes in the past and and we'll never do that again because it was just boring for after about a week
 	
 	
 		hum
 		is that right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 		uh out in New Mexico one time we bought a really run down oh terribly run down home and uh it took us a year and a half to turn it around and make almost forty five thousand in profit on it
 		and that was just
 	
 	
 		oh it sounds like you've got a good bit of experience in that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh it's just we you know we map out what we want to do and we go for it uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		whoever's got time to do it and course you get the major things done like your you know have the floors redone or have carpet put in whatever but the rest of it we usually do ourselves
 	
 	
 		sure we're thinking about possibly building a house now we aren't real sure whether we're gonna be able to do that or not but we just talked to a builder today as a matter of fact
 		you know just uh beginning to think about sketching out some plans and talked about some of the different uh
 		ways to go on you know different things
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh i think about that from time to time because we've never actually you know built one that we wanted you know the way we wanted it and things like that but
 		i'm not sure that our interest is that piqued in it to do something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah it sounds like you're uh really into uh remodeling what you get
 	
 	
 		yeah renovation renovation is kind of where we're at like our our favorite TV program is This Old House has been for many years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and we would like to get ahold of something really old and redo it uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there again we might go back out to Smithville and buy another home  and because they're so it's a town that time has passed by so there are a lot of old big homes and they're fairly inexpensive
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum how far away from Austin is it
 	
 	
 		so
 		it's forty miles uh it's on the it's on the river and it's a quite nice little town they've been able to keep out a lot of businesses and things i mean there's no KMarts or anything like that around so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		makes it kind of nice
 	
 	
 		ever are you um
 		looking to get
