 
     		
 	
 		okay here we go so what's your favorite team
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		uh  Cowboy fan die hard
 	
 	
 		naturally huh
 	
 	
 		yeah ever since i was last sixteen seventeen years well as long as i can remember yeah ever since seventy six but um  yeah big time they are uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		everyone's jumping on the bandwagon now after the season they had what part of Patterson
 		and that uh that California is that
 	
 	
 		it's um like seventy five miles from Oakland and San Francisco
 	
 	
 		oh okay so you're up
 	
 	
 		it's in the valley
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
  
 		so i guess you're uh
 	
 	
 		well i used to be a Raider fan when they were there but now i'm a 49er fan
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		there you go there you go
 	
 	
 		you know and the 49ers just went down down down this year
 	
 	
 		yeah but  if they would've made to the play-offs i mean they were they were the hottest team i thought at the end of the season it's just it's kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's kind of bad that they miss out on the play-offs with a tie breaker or whatever but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah right right
 	
 	
 		that
 	
 	
 		so what what do you think's gonna happen Sunday
 	
 	
 		uh i think it's um Buffalo
 	
 	
 		i hope it's Buffalo
 	
 	
 		i i really do i think it's their time to
 	
 	
 		you know i'm really i'm
 	
 	
 		everyone's picking Washington but
 		i don't know i mean i think the AFC's been getting beat up every year you know lost a few Super Bowls that
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because they went last year they should have won it and you know missed that kick but
 	
 	
 		yeah lost by what one point
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty bad for the kicker but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think they'll do it i mean naturally Redskins
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and the Cowboys don't have a
 		much like for each other but um
 	
 	
 		well at least Dallas was in the play-offs you know
 	
 	
 		yeah it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the the way they went out that didn't go over and it killed by Detroit but they're young team i mean they got all those draft picks next year i mean their future's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean they're one of the young i mean they got so many stars and with Jimmy Johnson i mean you never know what he's gonna do it's just that guy's a wizard drafting people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum do you get to go to very many games
 	
 	
 		i went to  four games this year actually um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		friends of mine have season tickets we've always it's always um each year we've taken turns in getting them and kind of
 		switched around on them everything and i just graduated and i moved back so i got to see more games finally
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i went to school at Texas Tech out in Lubbock Texas for last four years i so saw the games on TV but i hadn't been to any since yeah Thanksgiving once i guess
 	
 	
 		hm um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so you make any many 49er games
 	
 	
 		no i've never been to a 49er game i used to go to all the Raider games when they were in Oakland and
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess it still want them back in Oakland huh
 	
 	
 		uh it would be nice yeah but uh i don't think that's ever gonna happen
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess there's not many Al Davis fans out there
 	
 	
 		you know um now i'm just waiting for something to come out out this way out in the valley
 	
 	
 		uh you got just so many
 	
 	
 		Sacramento still has a chance i guess of getting a team someday
 	
 	
 		yeah there's so many teams out in California though i mean that's what the Rams the Raiders the
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh uh that's just
 	
 	
 		so you plan on uh watching the game Sunday
 	
 	
 		yeah um going Super Bowl party actually so um
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'll be out there for do it every year how about y'all
 	
 	
 		well that'll be nice yeah that'll be nice yeah we're gonna have a little few people over to watch the game you know just serve hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that so we won't have to miss out on anything
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and there you go
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah i i just wish it would start a little bit earlier because i guess well out there it starts at four but starts at six here you know that's
 		i don't i mean people you know that they're wondering why their ratings go down every year it's because people get don't like to
 	
 	
 		i know it's too late huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean but a time because lot of people you know they got to work the next day they don't wanna be sitting around at nine or ten at night and
 		you know they start taking off but
 	
 	
 		yeah i was wondering for sure what time it started i thought it was three or something but you say it's four out here huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's six it's six o'clock here like six eighteen so it'll be
 	
 	
 		six o'clock your time huh that's terrible
 	
 	
 		but it's one good thing about living out there daylight everything
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		well
