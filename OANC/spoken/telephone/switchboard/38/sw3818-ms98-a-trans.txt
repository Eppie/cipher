 
     		
 	
 		hello
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hello
 	
 	
 		yes do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		i do i have a big dog
 	
 	
 		oh what kind
 	
 	
 		huh oh he's just a big bloodhound
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i had some rabbits and they were much easier to take care of than this big dog is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i bet what happened to the rabbit
 	
 	
 		well we got the bloodhound and the rabbits and the bloodhound didn't mix well so  they were easier to get rid of than the big dog and my kids were anxious to have a have a puppy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		okay well we have two dogs  uh Chasta's the small one that we
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		kind of inherited  and then we have Lady that Gene has been wanting for a long time it's a collie
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and she is a sweetheart
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we have two cats
 		and one of them now Lady can go up the steps she goes up the steps really really slow
 		and she kisses Nikki
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they kind of you know look at each other and everything and then then Chasta uh Lady'll turn around and come back down stairs but she knows that if she moves fast
 		that uh she's going to move you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and um  by the way my other big pet here said he's gonna call you tonight  and
 	
 	
 		okay  well i've had some really interesting things happening with my dog let me tell you about this
 	
 	
 		you have
 	
 	
 		i have a dog that at nighttime when it wants to go in the garage because he's kind of spoiled he will bark
 		and i have a neighbor next door who gets real mad at this so
 		for the last three weeks he's turned us into the police and in to the uh the animal control and every time they come over of course he's very well behaved and he doesn't bark or anything and so
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's just really gotten out of hand i mean he has called and threatened my kids and to come over and kill the dog it's going it's just berserk
 	
 	
 		oh
 		he doesn't have any pets
 	
 	
 		he does  he has a dog himself out in the backyard that barks but for some reason this dog's bark just drives him up a wall and he's just
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's been really upsetting he keeps calling and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know it bothers me when the dog barks so as soon as he barks we put him in the garage but
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know what the problem is
 	
 	
 		oh for crying out loud well
 	
 	
 		he is an alcoholic so i think he's just found something to vent his anger on and it's he's decided that it's us but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum well we don't have that problem Lady hardly ever barks at all unless she's outside playing and uh Chasta only barks like when the paper boy delivers the mail she might bark for a little bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		see that's like this dog it only barks i mean the longest it ever barks is five or ten minutes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but you know he's called over and said he's going to get the police to take Lee away and that we're idiots for having a dog like that and
 	
 	
 		i'll be
 		oh that's too bad
 	
 	
 		it's just really been upsetting because they were real good neighbors up until this
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		this time
 	
 	
 		yeah that would that would really be upsetting with me too if my neighbors didn't like my dogs you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh well of course two of two other neighbors have dogs you know and they get to come over and play
 	
 	
 		well see everybody everybody all the way up has a dog that's what's so strange  every house all you know all the way up from on five you know five houses up from me and five houses down have dogs
 	
 	
 		um-hum hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum  well some people have dogs but they really don't like them i don't know why they even keep them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know really some a lot of people have pets and
 	
 	
 		yeah i figure why have them if you're not gonna take real good care of them
 	
 	
 		oh yeah God mine are like my family
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		at night they sit out here by the door by the patio door and look in you know sit side by side
 	
 	
 		yep that's how this one is
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so every night i think for two hours every night and then we let them in
 		and they come in they just lay down but just i guess just the idea that they're in the house with us for a while you know
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah feel loved huh  huh  well i haven't i don't know what i you know i can't figure out how to solve the problem unless i get rid of Kahuna and uh you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  so
 	
 	
 		i've got to live in this neighborhood so it's almost boiled down to do i
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		do i keep a pet that i love or do i live unhappily in a neighborhood paranoid of whether he's ever gonna bark or not
 	
 	
 		well that's a shame you know and you can i know you can have their barker taken out but who'd want to do that that would be awful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 		well that's too bad
 		but anyhow we don't have that problem like i say
 	
 	
 		well i'm thinking about going back to rabbits they were quiet  mess free
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well at least you can still get some right
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a ample supply of rabbits
 	
 	
 		well that's good  well let's see
 	
 	
 		boy
 		well this is really a treat
 	
 	
 		isn't it funny though  i just wondered if someday this was going to happen
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah let's hope it happens again
