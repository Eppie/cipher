 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what hobbies do you have
 	
 	
 		uh i crochet uh in in fact uh that's what i was doing when the phone rang
 	
 	
 		oh you do
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you making an Afghan
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm making a baby Afghan uh for my daughter-in-law's sister-in-law who's expecting baby number one at age forty
 	
 	
 		oh how wonderful
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		so  i feel uh i feel like she needs a goody
 	
 	
 		well i have a sister-in-law who had a baby at age
 		forty and i think again at forty three so she's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i'm expecting too so on my first
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um i don't uh the only thing i really have done in the past is um
 		uh cross stitch and needlepoint
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i had learned to crochet some things you know those little kitchen towels
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where you cut a towel in half and you sew the top part on so you can i mean crochet the top part of it so that you can attach it to an oven
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've done that kind of stuff but i haven't done anything as big as an Afghan
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you do that often
 	
 	
 		no i i really don't uh in fact this is the first thing i've crocheted in in uh some time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh my grandmother taught me to crochet when i was five years old which is a long long long time ago
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so but i i don't knit my something goes wrong with my knitting the the gauge doesn't work
 	
 	
 		um-hum  yeah that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh
 	
 	
 		um i just haven't been
 		oh i think i learned how to do that when i was real young too um one thing i'd kind of like to learn how to do is um quilt
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i see so many beautiful quilts and i have friends that that make them but you know there's just seems like there's not that amount of time nowadays
 	
 	
 		hum i know i know
 	
 	
 		you know because i work full-time outside the home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		right now anyway i hope that'll change after the baby gets here but
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then you don't have the time because you're tending to the child
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um it would be fun to learn how to do a few of those things
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'll tell you how i sort of feel about it
 		i i feel like uh of course in the olden days it was a matter of necessity
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it it i feel like now that you ought to do what you really like to do not just because your neighbor or your friends or your sister or somebody else is doing it
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh the the if it's not real recreation
 		it's it's it's not doing you any good
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's true um like some people make uh um decorating their house a hobby
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i have a friend who she and i both got into our houses around the same time and she's real she has a knack for that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know she made her own curtains and and i would love to be able to do all of that but i don't feel that i have quite the knack that she does
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so uh you know we're thinking of hiring a decorator and stuff and i sometimes feel like you know that's a cop out but yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if if i i don't want to spend all the time and money and not and then feel like it looks real cheaply done or or you know not be satisfied with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um my mother had that same knack you know for decorating and and it probably just comes with with age and with years of experience you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		no no it doesn't it you either do it or or you either like it or you don't you either have a knack for it or you don't uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and and and uh again i i feel like that
 		if there's something else that you'd rather do uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		some people have a natural green thumb
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and uh if that's what you like to do fine but if you don't
 		then uh get a second job and hire somebody
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do something that you like to do uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		life is too short uh
 		i enjoy crocheting it it's real recreational recreation for me but
 		uh and and i used to sew a lot but uh and i just don't have the time anymore i just now barely keep up with my mending
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh you know uh if you don't like to sew buy it readymade everything is available anymore and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah isn't that true
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we uh in fact mending it you even kind of has gone by the wayside for some most for many people if they get a hole in their sark sock
 		they don't darn it they they uh
 	
 	
 		hum-um dump it
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh throw it away and buy a new pair
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um
 		yeah there's a lot of things that i think that i'd like to do
 		but i don't make the time to do them you know and i keep thinking oh well when this happens then i'll have more time to do it and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because i like committing a a great amount of time to something if i'm working on it
