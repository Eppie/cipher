 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh how how's the crime rate up there
 	
 	
 		uh well we're right between uh Milwaukee and Chicago
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so there's there's just been a big Coke bust uh here because i think people pass through
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know on their way back and forth through the bigger cities
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um it's it's okay i mean there's crime everywhere it it's
 		probably not
 		it's not you know the
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		best place
 		to be but
 	
 	
 		is it anywhere near Racine
 	
 	
 		yeah it's right next to Racine
 	
 	
 		really my uh old old girlfriend uh was from there
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah uh actually i went i went and saw her about four years ago her parents had moved to Chicago and uh
 		at this point they had moved out of Dallas and everything then they had moved back and she was going to school down here and i went and saw her one summer and uh we went up there
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i never been up there i just remember
 		it's a different area from down here obviously but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah it's like ten minutes away from me
 	
 	
 		uh so you're a cheese head huh  yeah well we're i mean down here i mean Dallas i mean this crime rate's ridiculous i mean it's just
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		i'm getting ready to move actually in the probably the next year or so so i mean but
 	
 	
 		really it's that bad
 		the crime because of the crime
 	
 	
 		it's it yeah i mean it isn't Washington DC but it's there's just so many uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean we've had like four or five uh since school started like uh in high school people uh
 		incidents where kids shooting you know a teacher or you know since you know the school year and everything like New Year's Eve there were three people shot right away i mean like in the first ten minutes of the new year you know so
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		it's just been it's ridiculous there's a lot of problems right now i mean the uh
 	
 	
 		with the
 	
 	
 		the police chief out here is the former assistant police chief uh Darryl Gates in LA
 		so i mean he's not like you know beating up anybody but
 		there's just it's a big city and it's what you know you get and there's there's just getting a lot it's getting overcrowded and there's a lot of uh
 		immigrants from uh Mexico and stuff so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's it's getting pretty ridiculous
 		but uh i'm sure you know since you're near Chicago i'm sure you could
 		it's not exactly a peaceful city either you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no it's not
 	
 	
 		so it's the same situation really
 	
 	
 		it
 	
 	
 		so i'm actually in Richardson which is just north of Dallas it's a little suburb
 		but
 		yeah i mean
 	
 	
 		it yeah it's gotten worse too nothing's getting better
 		seems like it's always getting worse
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't see how it can get better i mean it's got to totally
 	
 	
 		i think it has to get worse first before it can get better
 	
 	
 		yeah stricter laws or something that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		they need something  and it
 	
 	
 		if i could solve problems i'd be a rich person but guess i can't
 		i'm just it's one of those deals where i mean you know try to look at you know look at at other countries what they do but i mean we're not like barbarics uh i don't
 		you know it's just too many problems with uh people getting paroled before uh you know early and coming out committing another crime while they're still on probation we've had a lot of problems out here with that course
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i heard uh Dallas cops are really strict like
 	
 	
 		well it's it's kind of yeah they shoot first then ask questions later you know that's that's their motto
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		whoa
 	
 	
 		they're they're not uh
 		you got to be careful if i mean i never had a problem i mean i'm not like
 		hang just you just don't hang out in Dallas or you got to be you know where not to be at night and the you know
 		just are certain places you don't even
 		certain parts of town you just stay away from you know
 	
 	
 		yeah same here certain parts of our city uh you just don't go by you just don't
 	
 	
 		right and you just
 		yeah you just leave it alone i mean
 	
 	
 		because then you're asking for trouble
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how old are you
 	
 	
 		twenty one
 	
 	
 		twenty one yeah
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		oh i'm twenty three
 	
 	
 		twenty three
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		that's pretty wild right next to Racine huh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		actually uh my sister lives in Racine
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		God i never thought i would ever run into somebody
 		look i'll read the paper every now and then and something Racine Wisconsin will pop out you know but yeah it's just kind of a little town um
 	
 	
 		it's bigger than Kenosha by a little bit and their crime rate's crime rate's a lot worse than ours
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah they just some guy uh couple months ago he got out a machete did you read about that and started just hacking people in the street with it
 	
 	
 		with with the machete no i didn't hear about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh that was in Racine
 		it's sad i mean you can't even drive or walk down the street at night or anything
 	
 	
 		God
 		well uh in Wheaton Illinois where her parents live and that's where that uh
 	
 	
 		i've heard of that
 	
 	
 		yeah it's just like forty five miles outside of Chicago and few years ago i guess there was some uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think it was some
 		um some lady was like shot uh
 		killed attacked some school children
