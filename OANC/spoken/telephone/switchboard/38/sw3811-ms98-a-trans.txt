 
     		
 	
 		so you have a child
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah we have a
 	
 	
 		two years old in child care right now
 	
 	
 		two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		pretty reasonable price we think
 		how about you do you have any children
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yes our first and he just turned three months
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		so we're  just starting into hunting for child care right now both of us are students
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		are you where are you student
 	
 	
 		uh uh University of Southern Mississippi
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i was a professor in a university here in California for a while
 	
 	
 		she's
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah uh are you gonna uh put your son in child care in a a year or two
 	
 	
 		uh probably um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		actually spring semester a year from now he's gonna have to be in child care for uh five days a week
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		more than likely uh depending on how my class schedule runs because my wife will be doing her internship that semester it'll be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four six anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care by that point right now we're trying to avoid it but we just
 		a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him uh i get out of class at
 		certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class
 		you know once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home so for about twenty minutes twenty thirty minutes a day we got a babysitter comes in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well that's a good experience i think and uh  there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good and they kind of boil down to
 		uh any other important decision you really have to explore the alternatives and what we found
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were gonna be loving and uh  that's more important than anything else we could have sent uh her to a fancier
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um facility um she goes to a home this is a um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a couple uh emigrated from China early in in their lives they've been here probably thirty forty years they've got three daughters
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um and they have a loving home and uh they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends so it's a good experience i think if it's good i think it's very good for the child
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh that makes a big difference
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and if it's a loving environment i think it's very good and and that's really what we've learned about it she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of a preschool in a year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um we feel real fortunate and we were able to uh
 		just uh
 		choose in the marketplace i don't know what it's like around uh Hattiesburg
 	
 	
 		there's a lot of child care available but invariably there's waiting lists
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the uh okay the university uh university's uh uh department of um uh well their Home Economics Department
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i'll bet they're involved
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um they uh they have a subbranch uh American Family Counseling and their people staff this this uh the child care center just off campus
 		but uh they have a pretty good size  waiting list  so uh
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's uh i know it's it's a real uh hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities out here at Stanford they have a
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know a a a real good facility and there uh is is quite a waiting list to get into that so it's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it's a it's a it's an important decision it's an industry that's still a cottage industry and i think that it it really is buyer beware
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well it's best
 		yeah a cottage industry's the best way to do it really because if you over
 	
 	
 		well it is the best way to do it interestingly i think that um my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn because i think what we're gonna go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market as a matter of fact my future is banked on that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh
 		pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life
 	
 	
 		yes
 		it's amazing how much good things like uh Sesame Street will do
 	
 	
 		it's it's phenomenal it's phenomenal the the programming
 	
 	
 		is uh
 	
 	
 		the human operating system is my area
