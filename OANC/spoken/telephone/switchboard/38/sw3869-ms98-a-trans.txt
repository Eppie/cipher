 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		obviously there have been a lot of changes in the roles of women over the past couple generations do you do you wanna speak first about your opinions about what those changes have been
 	
 	
 		okay um i think although there have been some i'm still of the opinion that we're second rate citizens in most areas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i believe probably World War II is when you know the thing started that caused
 		women to be more liberated because the men were at war and they needed women in the factories and things have never been the same
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		as far as the
 		as far as the job market women started working outside the home then but it's taken a long time and i think we've got a long way to go
 	
 	
 		uh  well i agree with you there i feel that there's
 		there's is a turning point ahead still ahead of us we haven't gotten there yet
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree with that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		excuse me but i do think that
 		there is a greater awareness of the the benefits that the the feminine side of people offers you know as well as men you know when you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		when you see some of what's gone on in the self development areas um you know men trying to find their feminine side is is probably something that men uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		half a generation ago wouldn't have even considered as feasible
 	
 	
 		no
 		no and then i think it's a good turn i do see uh one of the reasons i also believe there's a lot to be ahead as i return to college and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i see girls of twenty or so they think there is no problem they don't realize the struggle's just at the last few years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for them especially to go into professions that they could've just been laughed at and it can't be done anymore at least legally it can't be done
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's true that is fairly recent
 	
 	
 		i think
 		yes and i think just like today i mean it may be
 		people that don't want you in a certain profession they can't state it where i don't think the change has come like from the men's side is they can still feel it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know  i think
 	
 	
 		i feel i definitely feel that that's true in the political arena it's gonna be a lot longer before women are in positions of authority authority on a on a majority basis you know there's always gonna be a a few but
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know whereas in education and in health care women dominate because those are seen as supportive roles
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		i think it's interesting to just look at the history of women in history in in several cultures to to determine why in Western culture
 		they take the role that they do because it's it's a matriarchial society in a lot of different parts of the world that that puts women in a much stronger position and yet  in the west it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just coming around to the point that we can recognize that the power that that a woman offers to the society you know in terms of nurturing as well as
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah i wasn't aware of that either until uh just a year ago when i took a sociology course that even existed that's how indoctrinated i was
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but then i'm forty six i grew up with the generation of the guys my brothers went to college and i'm now struggling to no and it
 	
 	
 		that's exciting
 	
 	
 		wasn't important you know you go be a secretary or be a beautician
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that was my choice and uh
 		but yeah i didn't even realize there were societies like you say where women were were important
 	
 	
 		uh still a lot of that influence
 		yes yes and there's so much that's
 		um inculturated we don't realize in the home how we're
 		how we're influenced i think that even though my parents might've said you know i'm i'm in an area uh health care where there are a lot of women obviously but
 		my orientation was never toward being a physician it was toward being a health care provider in another area and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		even though i heard from my my father it certainly go you know pursue as far as you can you can be a physician there was this under lying tone in our home because my mom did not work outside the home that it was also okay to not do that and so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's been a challenge to to cope with both of my orientations i i have a very nurturing side that would in some ways like not to work outside the home
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i find myself looking towards what i'm doing and i'm leaning towards education and that's still another area of women but
 		that's what i wanna do you know have made i have made that decision that that's what i want to do even if it is the traditional thing it's still what i wanna do and i know it's like
 	
 	
 		um-hum hum
 		yes i think that over time we will recognize what
 		our given rights our our given uh gifts are rather that that are different from men and and it's okay that
 		that there are some differences but that there are also a lot more areas that can overlap that that at this point don't i think girls are told that they're probably not gonna be as good at math as as boys are and and they they
 	
 	
 		right
 		yes i'm suffering suffering through that too yeah
 	
 	
 		they may be influenced by that in their school work
 	
 	
 		i was very seriously
 	
 	
 		i don't know if i was by my by the influence or whether i just am not very oriented in math as i am to other like verbal
 	
 	
 		well i'm not because i have been tested by the office
