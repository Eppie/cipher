 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what do you think have been the most significant changes
 	
 	
 		uh mainly the fact that they let women in law now
 		i think that had a lot to do with the way people thought about women
 	
 	
 		so lawyers
 	
 	
 		not just lawyers but police officers and judges and
 		the whole legal profession in general
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because it used to be strictly male and the views on it used to be strictly male
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and now there's women in it and i think that affected a lot of things
 	
 	
 		well i think that's a big contributor i think women have uh really
 		um begun to penetrate a lot of fields that were dominated by men for centuries
 	
 	
 		oh i can i can definitely agree with that i'm i'm in a field that most people say is strictly male
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah mechanics
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i think um
 		one of the best things that has happened in the twentieth century has been the uh penetration of a lot of these fields by women and  i think
 		it's gonna continue uh and even though it's pretty difficult now for
 		some men and and a lot of women i think uh
 		it's gonna bring very good things and uh we're going to be a lot better off as a society as it continues but it's a painful transition
 	
 	
 		oh yeah very painful especially when you have certain women that take very dim views on mothers that actually work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm a mother of two and i still hold down a job and a lot of people say well you're not home with your kids all the time your kids are gonna turn out bad i don't think so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think there are a lot of attitudes that have to change and i guess that's the big thing
 		you know as people change their attitudes that's gonna make the biggest difference women uh participating as equal partners
 		in our society is one of the best things that will ever happen and history will record that but a lot of people really don't like that idea and uh
 	
 	
 		some men but you'd believe you wouldn't believe how many women are against it
 	
 	
 		no i i'm not look at what happened with the Anita Hill testimony before the Senate subcommittee and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh now i'm not surprised by that at all we have uh we have a two year old my wife uh works out of the home um and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i think just looking at how uh her uh views differ from those of her mother a generation before
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it's it it's really changing attitudes and um the economic necessity and the political changes as you pointed out are going to make a big difference i think
 		um it's a painful transition but a really important one and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and i think it's one of the biggest steps
 		we or any other country in general could take
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's a big step for humankind and i think uh it's it's real progress but there are a lot of people with attitudes that have to change and i i guess in answering the question that's what i would say i'd say
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that overall it's just the attitude of men and women toward equal participation and equal pay and equal political influence and all sorts of other things for women because
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		that's really gonna be better for everybody but a lot of people are threatened by that as is reflected in what goes on
 	
 	
 		yeah that's for sure and you know a lot of people think that the men are the ones that are fighting this
 		but you'd be surprised the majority of the people that are against women going into the work force doing you know even jobs you know on an even keel with men
 		a good percentage of them are the women that are fighting it and most people say well men try and keep women locked up that's not necessarily true
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		i mean the women have these ideas that they got to be the little home makers and they have to stay at home or they're not doing good you know a good job
 		and that's not necessarily so but everybody's blaming it on the guys saying well the guys don't let the women out
 		that's not necessarily so it's just the women have to realize they can do both
 	
 	
 		well i think i think both
 		yeah both attitudes have to change and i think uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um it's it's evident evident to me as i look at all the television shows that now focus on the relationship between men and women uh watching Roseanne last night watching
 		uh the show that preceded it Home Improvements all these television shows which reach the American people are beginning to reflect new attitudes and those
 	
 	
 		yep and the fact that women are actually getting out and working and also keeping the home together
 	
 	
 		well and not only i mean  the the fact of the matter is that women have have carried more than their weight and are still doing that and
 		um i see i think this is part of the problem for men as well as a guy i recognize that it's uh it's men who've suffered from this too because men need to learn to learn
