 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so okay so what is the subject now
 	
 	
 		
  
 		it's on the the time that we spend with our children
 	
 	
 		okay well let me tell you about our our situation um  we have two girls uh one is twelve one is uh
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		is eleven and i've got uh two sons that are um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		six and three
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh between the four
 		uh my two girls play a lot of soccer and we travel a lot with them
 		and they're either practicing or playing and and it is really tough to fit everything in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i'm not real sure what your situation is if you you have any kids that are still at home but
 	
 	
 		uh we just uh well we have the one that uh has left
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he was here a year ago and uh he was involved in wrestling wrestling and along with my three older sons we had six children and our oldest son our second son is uh
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he's a doctor and he was uh All State in wrestling
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then uh my last son that just left home is All State in wrestling so we had two in our family but we had a lot of participation with them and i know what you're talking about where you it's difficult to find time but i
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i i feel it's very important that you support the kids as much as you can you and uh uh the spouse because uh when uh well both sons uh when they were wrestling uh they would kind of look up
 	
 	
 		you bet
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to see if we were in the audience and the that's the last they pay any attention to us until after the game is over right and the wrestling match
 	
 	
 		it sure makes a big difference doesn't it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh we really enjoyed it uh to be involved with our our uh children and i think it's very important that's something that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the parents today and and and there is so much involvement that it gets pretty difficult but i think with with church and everything else that you're doing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh that's where a family relationship is really built and uh it's uh then they have
 	
 	
 		it sure is
 		we have uh in fact we this this past um Christmas
 		we went out to California we uh both my girls were involved in in tournaments out there so went out there we spent Christmas with uh my wife's family out there in in California and then um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we drove out to or down to Southern California and had the tournament we went to Disneyland as a family and and just kind of you know spent time together that way
 	
 	
 		well super
 		well those are things that they'll they'll never forget and uh they know they're loved when when that takes place
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that you're supporting them there are so many families that i know about today that they just don't take uh time to do anything with their children
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you bet my wife just said to tell you that your grandson is beautiful
 	
 	
 		oh good good well we're gonna try to get down to uh hopefully for his uh uh the oldest one's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		baptism and then the grandson's uh our youngest to get his uh to the blessing but i don't know whether we can make it or not we're gonna give it a shot but that's coming up
 	
 	
 		
 
 		to be blessed
 		yeah i know that means a you'd mean a lot to uh to Brian he's a he's a heck of a nice guy boy i really enjoy uh being friends with him he's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i appreciate that he was a super son and when he was wrestling uh we had two sons wrestling and we one week we went to twelve wrestling matches in one week
 	
 	
 		
 
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		we had one the oldest his older brother was in college and he was in high school and we could uh get to all of those but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		when did he find time to learn how to do brakes he just helped me do my brakes
 	
 	
 		oh he he's very talented in all kinds of things uh he's not like his dad he can do about anything and uh we really miss him being in in Texas
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah he is
 		
 
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so anyway
 	
 	
 		well that's great yeah um  my work uh uh fortunately my work doesn't take me away from  from this area so
 		i have uh i have some time i own my own business out here so i have some time just just spent with them you know whenever the time uh whenever they need me but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum well that's super
 	
 	
 		i i know that there's quite a few  people in our family that uh or in our  you know in our area that um
 		that work  outside and and they have a even tougher  time trying to  uh schedule time with  their families
 	
 	
 		um-hum  yep well be sure and tell Brian hello and it's been a pleasure talking to you sounds like our time's up and uh give him the the best from him his dad
 	
 	
 		okay i'm i'm not sure if our time's up or  my phone just  went out of out of whack  i think that was just my phone
 	
 	
 		oh oh i see okay
 		i've i've this the first call so i don't know what happens when the time's up
 	
 	
 		well they'll come back on and tell us when the time is up yeah it they should be another couple of minutes so
 	
 	
 		oh i see okay fine
 		and course church involvement i think is very important too uh that with parents uh supporting their children in in taking them to Church and going with them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's that's another activity that uh time is spent and
 	
 	
 		well i think that's it that's probably more important than anything else and
