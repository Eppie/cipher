 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay so what now what are your opinions on recycling
 	
 	
 		well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility
 		until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand
 	
 	
 		yeah i've heard that too
 	
 	
 		and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it is very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my paper i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them
 		and there's some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile
 	
 	
 		well see i had started saving newspapers and i have save a ton of them and uh that's i can't remember where i went to take them but they wouldn't they wouldn't take them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that cannot glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 		there's no really recycling facilities
 	
 	
 		no we have a pilot program in Arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out
 	
 	
 		i think that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		and i think that's what it is gonna have to come to where we're just forced to
 	
 	
 		besides well like a law or whatever and that's how it is in New York or isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think so it's just because they have to you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum you get ticketed if you don't do it right
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh and i think it's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's it's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		plus you have to have a place to store all of it and see i live in an apartment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and
 		so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in Iowa the state i'm from
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i believe it's gone up to a dollar now everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay
 		ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store and you get it back
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh so that way that kind of forces you to recycle
 	
 	
 		you're forced to and uh you also don't see the litter there people just
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian i don't know if you've tried it
 	
 	
 		yeah i've seen them
 	
 	
 		and they have on the back it's five cents okay it's still five cents and it even shows the states that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that take them back
 	
 	
 		yeah well what some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now
 	
 	
 		is Texas one of them
 	
 	
 		Texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		no i don't think that there's enough being done now i work at JC Penney at their corporate headquarters and we have a paper recycling
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		program that's um company wide and i do the recycling for that
 	
 	
 		okay do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper good because there is a lot of waste there isn't there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i know there's a lot of computer paper though that you can't use
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um we use to have uh i mean i i don't even remember how much money that they've um mean i mean the money that they've made from the recycling program they've donated it to charities but i mean they've made a substantial amount of money from it
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like i've decided Downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am gonna stick with Downy because they were first you know i want them to have my business
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that
 	
 	
 		well now you see some of this stuff and you're and then when they come out with the new things you are like uh well why didn't you think of that before
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and i think that it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't wanna think about it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and uh i just look at it as i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something you know i want to feel like i at least tried
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't know it just may overwhelm us
 		here when we run out of places to put it then we'll be forced to it may be too late
 	
 	
 		do they not ever i mean i don't know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like
 	
 	
 		very little that's another thing and if you ever know like i know Amway i only use a couple things form Amway that it says this is burnable material well
 	
 	
 		then that's pollution
 	
 	
 		that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i guess you run into the pollution factor
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and then just like the glass bottles that that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in Texas and there's no place i can take glass to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i still throw away a lot of glass
 	
 	
 		
  
 		truly sad
 	
 	
 		yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic
