 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what experience have you had with family reunions
 	
 	
 		well actually uh oh the last eight or ten years i have
 		an aunt and i i should say have like done our family reunion
 		and uh oh you know we send out letters to everybody and we rent a place in this uh savings and loan in a in a little town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh then everybody brings a covered dish and that sort of thing and uh
 		it's real nice because my mother uh
 		had seven brothers and sisters and if we didn't do this like the cousins would never see each other the aunts and uncles that's the type family reunion we've had there you know
 		so uh
 		you know if we found you know the years we don't do that  nobody nobody sees each other because everybody lives in different places you know
 	
 	
 		huh that's really good
 		yeah my mom my mom's family is all
 		
 
 		my family is really scattered out so if we didn't have family reunions we simply would never see each other for example um
 		my
 		my parents live in Seattle Washington
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		however all of my mom's and relatives and family are from Utah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and all of my dad's uh relatives and family are from Oregon so we we usually have family reunions once a year and we'll go to Utah and uh
 		go to  Oregon um
 		
 
 		my mom puts a big deal into the family reunion when they go to Utah um and um
 		she sometimes plans them and and sometimes helps in planning them usually um Southern Utah is so hot that um we pick there's the
 		they rent out this cabin that's up on a mountain i mean you have to go up into the hills to get some cooler temperatures and have a enjoyable time
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's what we usually do and then have of course the food is one of the highlights also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  yeah everybody fixes their specialty or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well it really in your case and mine too uh i guess in most everybody's as far as especially more distant relatives you know uh cousins aunts and uncles and so on
 		you just wouldn't see them if you didn't do something like that
 		well my immediate family like on my side uh has gotten large because there's four of us and now we've all had children and now we all have grandchildren
 		so that makes just my immediate family like thirty people so we do a separate reunion and we have a lake house uh about seventy miles from here
 		so we we've done it once we all get together down there
 		and um that works out real well because there's a lot
 		well lot of things everybody can do they can fish or they can you know swim or things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i know at the the family reunions on my dad's side that we go to in Oregon um we usually um
 		have it at a park and so you know swimming is always part of one of the activities so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		well it really doesn't much matter where where or how you do it as long as you manage to do it every how often did like your families up there have them
 	
 	
 		oh there's a there's a family reunion reunion um once a year um
 		for for each for my father's side and for my mother's side i know and my wife also um
 		so they try when they have family reunions they don't have them as regularly but when they do they try and make  big deal out of it and usually have you know something like a talent show or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um each family um does something
 		um
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah we have taken like old home movies from you know twenty five thirty years ago and and shown them at the family reunion
 	
 	
 		yeah my mom my grandma also has some
 		we haven't particularly shown those at the reunions but my grandma has some home movies and we ever whenever we go to her house we like to
 		see those those are
 		you know nice for memories
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we finally put ours on tape a few years ago there's places now that do that
 		and uh it really is nice when you when because you can get on one tape you can get about thirty or forty old reels you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		on there and it and then you can skip around and find what you want and all that it really has uh worked out good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		so how did you get on the TI thing
