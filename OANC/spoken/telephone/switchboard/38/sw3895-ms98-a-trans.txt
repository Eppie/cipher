 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well do you go camping Glen
 	
 	
 		yes uh we live uh right to the base of the Wasatch Front so uh uh as our children were growing up we spent a lot of time camping up in the mountains different taking our children with us or deer hunting or whatever
 	
 	
 		by camping
 		you you mean really roughing it
 	
 	
 		well well uh sometimes we did most of the time we'd  we'd put up tents and we'd go up and stay for a week or
 		uh weekend or go up into uh Yellowstone Park and and camp in the campgrounds up there
 	
 	
 		oh but that was
 	
 	
 		but we really had some enjoyable times as a family and uh some real good memories how about your experiences on camping uh what have you
 	
 	
 		uh well i've our children were growing up also uh we had a boat and we'd
 		go camping on the long weekends uh Memorial Day Fourth of July Labor Day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we went with some good friends and we'd get as many you know involved as we could and
 		so our kids really grew up all through uh you might say junior high and high school camping and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that sounds uh
 	
 	
 		we've really had a good time doing it um we went to a lake called Lake Tawakoni uh it's just kind of east and south of here in Texas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		we camped outside one time we had a tornado come through our campgrounds it was kind of interesting we had snakes and armadillos and
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		all those fun things huh
 	
 	
 		all the fun things that that make memories
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i'll say well we uh when we were up in uh  by Yellowstone Park we had uh moose that went through our campground and we had a a bear once that went through uh-huh black bear and then we
 	
 	
 		a bear oh oh
 	
 	
 		uh we've seen a lot of rattle snakes uh in our camping trips
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and all of those creatures of the wild and like you say those really make memories of things the kids never forget but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think the one that really excited the kids our kids were quite young and that's when this moose great big antlers come walking right through our campground we had a fire going and and uh it just kind of sauntered through and went over to a stream and was eating and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		didn't didn't mind you being there a bit huh
 	
 	
 		no no no he we uh didn't bother it and uh everything was fine but uh
 		it's uh camping has really uh been a a great part of our life and now we're we're older all of our kids are gone and we don't uh
 		uh fact last year was the first year i didn't go out camping on the deer hunt now we have quite a deer hunting season here in Utah and i didn't first time in uh fifty four years that i hadn't gone out in the mountains for the deer hunting so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		first time huh well
 	
 	
 		but anyway it uh
 	
 	
 		maybe you'll get a chance to go again
 	
 	
 		yeah when the grandkids uh get a little bit older then we'll we'll we'll do that again
 	
 	
 		take them well we kind of gave up camping about three four years ago to and we built a lake house
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so now all our outdoor activities are centered around the lake house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i would uh it's not like camping in a way but yet it is you're still uh on the
 	
 	
 		well
 		we're we're still outside but we we we figured we're getting a little too old to rough it as much as we used to
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		
 
 		yes uh we got uh where we had a a camper then we got us a fifteen foot trailer house that we we took up and
 		uh when we were going camping so we when we our kids were young we did uh pretty well rough it we were in some good snowstorms and uh
 		speaking about tornados up in Yellowstone uh one went through there usually they don't have such things here but
 	
 	
 		i didn't know they did yeah
 	
 	
 		it took down pine trees quite a swath and uh we were there right after that happened but uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh those tornados i guess are uh pretty scary things
 	
 	
 		i guess most you know there's probably not any part of the country that doesn't experience them every once in a while
 	
 	
 		um-hum that was amazing because that was like i say right up in Yellowstone and it's uh maybe once every hundred years or something we have something like that but uh and it happened and uh that was
 	
 	
 		i bet Yellowstone was a neat place to camp in we we went up we pulled a trailer out there from Illinois um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when uh probably about nineteen seventy four i'm trying no no no no it was before that it was must have been nineteen seventy two before we moved to Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh we had like a sixteen foot trailer that uh we pulled behind the car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and all the kids and the dog and everything and actually i i think i liked the camping with the tent better than pulling the trailer
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but we made it out to Yellowstone and it was gorgeous never forget that
 	
 	
 		oh it is it's it's beautiful we've spent a lot of time up there and that but that's a long ways to pull a trailer
 	
 	
 		yeah it was and uh we needless to say we haven't we haven't done it again  pulling the trailer is not the our favorite thing to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah
 		no
