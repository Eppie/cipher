 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone there
 	
 	
 		no i don't think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i'm afraid you're right
 	
 	
 		uh one evening i decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought oh well something's happens on Mockingbird
 		and then heard yells and screams and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		and they had stopped a uh  a stolen car
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and caught one of the men in the hedge and then the other one was on the roof in the back
 	
 	
 		by your house
 	
 	
 		by on my house
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness ah aye aye
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so i'm very much aware of uh crime in the cities and the and the concern about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my that's that's got to be a frightening way to spend spend an evening
 	
 	
 		it was
 		i uh i kept hearing noises and so i i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage so i got a gun my gun
 		and walked to the you know through the house into the garage there was no one there but i wanted to be sure
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		is Plano beginning to experience the the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan you know in the urban area
 	
 	
 		unfortunately yes yes
 	
 	
 		that's too bad
 	
 	
 		i think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get
 		the hoods and the ruf riffraff and everybody else in there and i think u
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek but uh we've been we've lived here sixteen years and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now you you know you can tell the change for sure
 	
 	
 		well i was thinking if you've been there that long you've seen Plano grow from what was really a a small town to a city
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well with all the uh
 		Central Expressway uh with all the stores and the uh restaurants and the
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it's just prime pickings for people driving by you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i was appalled to read the other day about the uh uh shooting on the tollway
 	
 	
 		that's that couldn't be too far from you neither uh
 	
 	
 		uh well it's further west of me
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i live over near White Rock Lake
 	
 	
 		oh yes okay
 	
 	
 		but uh uh it was really frightening to think that uh it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth uh i never thought about someone robbing those
 		but apparently they do
 	
 	
 		i don't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but
 	
 	
 		yeah it just doesn't seem possible does it
 	
 	
 		it's kind of
 		kind of stupid isn't it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time it's looks like easy pickings and away you go right
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah
 		and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in um the theft and the the violence that we see
 	
 	
 		i think you're right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too
 	
 	
 		it it is convenient isn't it i didn't know what i was doing
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right just like the old alcohol idea and
 	
 	
 		that kind of
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think people uh
 		i think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are
 		too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well yes and i work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System and uh uh uh do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are
 	
 	
 		oh boy where do you work
 		uh yes i think i do that uh
 		is that Amelia Earhout Earhart School there
 	
 	
 		uh no this is over near Lincoln High School
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh just not far off South Central Expressway
 	
 	
 		that's a pretty rough area there isn't it
 	
 	
 		it is a pretty rough area we're over by Fair Park
 	
 	
 		um my goodness
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		you know you watch the people there are marvelous BMW's and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and the kids see that and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where uh you know running for uh drug dealers if
 	
 	
 		definitely that area that that's big time big time there sure is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it surely is
 	
 	
 		i don't think i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself in that area
 	
 	
 		well i'm careful
 	
 	
 		gee that's the worst neighborhood in the whole city area
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh a little scary sometimes and uh i manage the
