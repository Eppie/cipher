 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay Cindy you there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay what kind of dinner parties have you had
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've had them uh where i've served up to twelve to sixteen people um and i had help with them um  and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		part of them i did were like a buffet and uh it i had uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just different uh side dishes and appetizers and one of them that that i'd remembered was uh
 		some uh sausage hors d'oeuvres and uh
 		anyhow uh you take uh a couple of uh
 		cups of Bisquick and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		sausage oh like a a Owens mild you can i guess you could use the hot if you wanted to yeah and uh  you
 	
 	
 		whatever you like huh yeah
 	
 	
 		put that in and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		make make it all doughy and then like i just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes and they are so good
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh that sounds delicious yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it's making me hungry for them  right now
 	
 	
 		yeah you know i've made like little Swedish meatballs but they're just made out of the beef you know
 	
 	
 		have you yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh with spices and things in them but never anything mixed with Bisquick
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i i've used that quite a bit and it and it seems to work real well um and uh um
 	
 	
 		um-hum hm
 	
 	
 		when i've had so many people uh to to feed like i'd try to do a ham
 		an a turkey and and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's my that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i've uh i had an open house party here once when after we moved in here
 		uh which i had uh things like that but i always cooked them ahead of time and then i just sliced them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and had macaroni salad with uh shrimp in it have you ever had that
 	
 	
 		no what
 	
 	
 		get some fresh little fresh shrimp and it's in your macaroni salad that you make
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the shrimp just gives it a really good flavor
 	
 	
 		oh i'll bet
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't like the can but the fresh you know
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll have to try that
 	
 	
 		yeah that was really good
 	
 	
 		i like things that are easy and and uh
 		nutritious
 	
 	
 		yeah right right  but uh at uh Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is kind of hard because you got so many people and then by time you pass everything around it seems like everything on your plate's cold
 	
 	
 		i know i know  well thank God for microwaves you know
 	
 	
 		so but anyhow i
 		yeah you can always take your plate and just heat it up you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh other than that i i don't have too too many parties uh you know i have like maybe just a couple another couple over for dinner
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh other than than than that i don't have you know a whole bunch of people like except except at Christmas and i have my family
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right well i don't anymore yeah it's been a few years and and uh
 		i don't have you know over a couple either and and uh  i try to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh have everything all ready and and it it just makes it a lot nicer where i don't spend spend all my time in the kitchen
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		and uh spaghetti and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's easy i always like to have that too you know everybody seems to like that too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know i don't think i've ever met anyone that didn't
 	
 	
 		no everybody likes that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then uh if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there you know especially if a pork roast that's what i love
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		i like it too
 	
 	
 		with my
 		and um  other than that in fact i'm just thinking of what goes next weekend when the Super Bowl's on
 	
 	
 		i do too
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i've asked a couple people to come over and i just uh had been thinking what to have for that
 	
 	
 		yeah well have you had any good ideas yet oh okay
 	
 	
 		no not yet  no and i you know i don't want to have to come away from the TV i want something that i can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the TV
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so i'll think of something just that that we can munch on over there you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they can just fill fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down
 	
 	
 		and that's the way to do it too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i think it's you know what's i think is so nice is that
 		in this day and time that we can have good food
 		that's good for you and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen and and it makes an awful lot of difference doesn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah preparing it right
 		oh it sure does
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		well when i was brought up you know we didn't
