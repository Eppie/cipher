 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		as Texas El Paso uh they were undefeated until uh Thursday night when they played the University of Utah here in Salt Lake City and uh
 	
 	
 		oh really hum
 	
 	
 		they were beaten by uh a last minute three point shot
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and uh so it kind of opened things up a little bit they play uh Brigham Young University tonight
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i i'm pretty sure uh they really got a good team this year and i think
 	
 	
 		do do they do they traditionally have a good team or is this sort of an unusually thing
 	
 	
 		uh yes they do uh they usually uh they're usually the one or two in the in the WAC conference and they're the only team from Texas
 	
 	
 		huh
 		huh
 		huh yeah see we're it's they're actually in the University of Texas system and i don't i don't even know anything about them i'm here in Austin we have uh University UT Austin
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right which is  which i mean i just generally go to the University of Texas right
 		the the Longhorns um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah who's doing the who's leading the conference
 	
 	
 		actually actually i don't know right now Longhorns aren't having quite the year that they had hoped um they they had a a star forward that that was disqualified because of
 	
 	
 		uh i see
 		oh
 	
 	
 		of something i guess as he was leaving his junior college they uh some supporter gave him a car or something and uh
 	
 	
 		oh  oh i see
 		that kind of fouled things up plus maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah it sure did because they were they had a real good start and then and then and then ended up you know they they're they're holding on but it's not it's not gonna be a  a season like they had last year when they went to the NCAA
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right well last year the University of Utah went and uh they had two of their stars uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		got hurt the beginning of the season this year and that's why uh uh Texas El Paso is uh is in the University of Utah went to the NC Double A's last year and they got into the final sixteen i guess but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh UTEP like i say is doing real well and it's it's too bad that they have something like that did they restrict the
 		uh the Longhorns as far as uh being able to play in any of the
 	
 	
 		no it it it something had happened outside of that you know and and it happened as as part of his junior college career
 	
 	
 		junior college so it didn't affect their program other than loosing him yeah right that's too bad
 	
 	
 		but no but they pulled him out of the out of the lineup
 		you know and it was something he he reported himself or i mean they  it wasn't a and and the NCAA uh immediately suspended him and then
 		and then actually UT on his behalf filed a an injunction in the court system to allow him to continue to play which worked for a few games and then they then they pulled him in so
 	
 	
 		yeah but
 		oh that's too bad
 	
 	
 		yeah but
 		they've been having uh i mean last last last year they had a real good team they had every they had a new coach Tom Penders come in um about i guess about three years ago
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and the the program had been in a long a long decline you know for for years they i guess back when Abe Lemons was here they built quite a quite a tradition
 	
 	
 		i see
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then it it kind of went downhill for about for a couple of coaches and Penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some you know playing some good basketball but
 	
 	
 		good i know uh i was in Montana this last week and i saw the uh
 		huh the women's team from uh Texas was playing uh Penn State
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh Penn State was ranked number eight i believe in the women's basketball and i i got to watch the half and then i had to leave on a flight uh back to Utah and i uh Texas was leading
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know how they came out i don't know if you heard or not but uh
 	
 	
 		i don't know yeah uh the women's program is quite interesting down here the the women's program here in in Austin um
 		actually for a while it was was drawing bigger crowds than the men's program if you could imagine that they but they you know they just have have traditionally been a dominant a dominant basketball team i mean they've they've always been in the top
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		top eight in the country um and actually had a couple of years that they haven't been quite as strong but but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the the Southwestern Conference uh they've been undefeated in the Southwestern they were no they aren't now but they had been undefeated in the Southwestern Conference for something like a five year streak or something
 	
 	
 		i wish them well
 	
 	
 		and had won the conference title for ten years in a row or something
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		and so that is they've they've that's that's quite a tradition here in in Texas but
 	
 	
 		i'll say
 		yeah uh that's uh
 		last year the University of Utah that was the best season they'd had and uh the well the the coach had come in this Rick Majerus he'd come in uh he'd only been there a couple years and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		really built the program and they were supposed to well they were rated up in the the first uh uh top ten this year until they lost their two of their their star players and uh through injuries
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and now they are uh they they did beat uh Texas El Paso and uh  that was kind of strange i guess Texas El Paso was just weren't weren't uh
 	
 	
 		up to speed yeah
 	
 	
 		hitting and uh
