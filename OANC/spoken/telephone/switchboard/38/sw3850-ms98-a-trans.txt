 		oh really
 	
 	
 		Quantum Leap yeah
 	
 	
 		Quantum Leap
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		did you see it the other night
 	
 	
 		um uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that was a that was pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah that one was what is that
 	
 	
 		when he with the psychic and everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah i like uh
 		i like
 		Northern Exposure and uh Home Improvement
 	
 	
 		oh i well i haven't seen either of those
 	
 	
 		you've never seen Northern Exposure
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		oh it's a great show
 	
 	
 		um
 		i also like to watch Star Trek but it's on so late here that i don't always get to see it
 	
 	
 		really yeah we like it too
 		have you seen the movie
 	
 	
 		uh i haven't seen any of the movies  because i just barely just like in the last year or so got interested in it and they're you know already out with number six by now but
 		so i haven't seen any of the movies yet but i
 	
 	
 		oh you haven't seen any of them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		oh well they're good
 		they're real good
 		they're uh
 		they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which ones are you watching the new ones
 	
 	
 		yeah i've seen uh quite a few of the older ones i haven't seen really the new generation that much
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is there one you prefer better the older one or the younger the newer one
 	
 	
 		well they're
 		they're a lot different but i like i like the older ones because at that time you know they were really
 		futuristic you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		the newer ones are
 		i guess the newer ones are real futuristic too but i like i like both of them
 	
 	
 		yeah i do too i have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones
 		a lot i mean he almost hates the new ones  yeah because he he thinks the newer one is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something but
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		whatever
 	
 	
 		no it's
 		not really
 		it's not really like a soap opera but
 	
 	
 		oh i think yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's
 		but that's true i mean you you learn more about the the characters and stuff but that's the way all shows are now
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 		well let's see
 		um
 		i like to watch Colombo because it's like a mystery thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's sort of how Matlock is but Colombo is
 		way tricky i mean he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh did you see the one
 	
 	
 		well the it seems they always show Colombo the same ones over and over though
 		you know what i'm saying like that one where he goes to college
 	
 	
 		um did
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or those is there a series on
 	
 	
 		um yeah there's like one on well we see it Thursdays at seven
 		and
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it was this last time it was about this um movie director
 		did you happen did you see that one
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw that one see that was a rerun
 	
 	
 		really oh i guess i've never
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm wondering if that's
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		see i don't know if that's the the
 		movie of the week or
 		or what but it seems like there's only about
 		four or five different ones and then and they keep showing them over and over
 	
 	
 		oh i guess i've i haven't seen it before
 	
 	
 		he was a movie director and he had that gal killed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		yeah on the set or something
 	
 	
 		that was pretty good though
 	
 	
 		yeah it was
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i yeah i like Colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um there's no never anything good on Saturdays though
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		i don't think so well Star Trek's on at five but i'm never home
 		so
 	
 	
 		what is it that there's something i watch
 		something i watch on Saturdays and i can't remember what it is
 		now i used to watch Twin Peaks
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you never saw that
 	
 	
 		i've heard of it a lot i've heard of a lot of
 		people somehow or something they'll say so and so from Twin Peaks or something you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that was a definite soap opera
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but it was it was a different type of show
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i didn't like the way it ended though
 	
 	
 		oh did they end the whole series
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah they didn't they only did it for i think two years
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but it's all over now
 	
 	
 		oh another show i like to watch is MASH
