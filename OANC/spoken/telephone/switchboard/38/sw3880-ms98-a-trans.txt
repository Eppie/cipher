 
     		
 	
 		tell me what's the last movie you saw
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the last movie i saw in a theater was Hook
 	
 	
 		Hook
 	
 	
 		and uh it was very enjoyable um
 		i'm trying to think there's a lot of movies i want to see
 	
 	
 		oh yeah there seems to be a lot out especially around Christmas but we were
 		kind of busy and didn't really get out to see any of them
 	
 	
 		but it but what the last one you saw
 	
 	
 		uh the last one i went to the theater to see was uh The Doctors
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and i thought that was real good
 		but i rent movies all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah we do too
 	
 	
 		yeah the last that seems to be the way we do it any more i saw Dying Young over the weekend
 	
 	
 		is that good that's with um i'm trying to think who's in that
 	
 	
 		and last week
 		uh what's her name Julia Roberts
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay
 	
 	
 		and uh it was just really good
 		i knew it was going to be sad and i knew somebody was going to be dying
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it was is still has an interesting plot twist to it
 	
 	
 		um we want to go see JFK
 	
 	
 		yeah trying to
 	
 	
 		i mean i have heard lots of reviews and stuff but i still want to see it just to
 	
 	
 		i have been putting off to go see that one but my wife wants to see it too
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		it just seems so much trouble any more to go to a theater
 	
 	
 		yeah it is and Plano has grown so much that
 		um you know the restaurants and stuff are all so crowded now you use to be able to get out to get a quick bit to eat and go see a movie and it's just not that way any more
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we usually stay in on Friday nights and rent movies and i think probably the last rented movie i saw
 		well no i take that back it wasn't rented i think it was just on HBO at my in-laws house or something but it was Hunt for Red October
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i
 	
 	
 		and i love that movie
 	
 	
 		yeah i went uh i went to the theater to see that one and then i rented it i think when it came out too
 	
 	
 		yeah oh that would've been a good one
 		that would've been a good one to see
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but renting them just doesn't do them justice sometimes
 	
 	
 		sometimes you're right it doesn't uh
 		but it beats watching what ever is on television
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true i mean i think like uh Dances with Wolves just
 		you know would be a good movie on television but it you know the scenery and everything was so beautiful on the screen
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we had a pretty quiet Christmas at our house this year and one of the things that we've been putting off for a long time was to was to rent all of the Godfather movies
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so we did that
 		and
 	
 	
 		all of them did you
 	
 	
 		it was uh you know like fourteen hours of Godfather stuff
 	
 	
 		oh wow in one night
 	
 	
 		no it took us about three days but
 	
 	
 		okay i was going to say that's a long movie
 	
 	
 		yeah well it was still lots i'm telling you when that that the last hour you know uh number three
 		we felt like we were Italians we were eating Italian snacks and drinking wine and we were thinking this has got to stop
 	
 	
 		how many are there
 	
 	
 		there's three
 	
 	
 		three okay
 	
 	
 		yeah it's almost something around fourteen hours
 	
 	
 		well that's not as bad as as uh Friday the 13th or Planet of the Apes  or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh but my i think my favorite though are old movies black and white
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i like the old prison movies in the thirties and things like that
 		it's just i don't know there's just something about them i think it reminds me of my childhood
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		not  i just remember when i was little in the summer we got to stay up all night and that's what was on
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so somehow that reminds me again with all my brothers and sisters and you know making popcorn and making homemade pizzas in the middle of the night and stuff so
 	
 	
 		we went through a stage where we rented a lot of the um Alfred Hitchcock
 		the you know like North by Northwest and Rear Window and all those and those are really good i mean you know the old black and whites and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i watched uh Doris Day Retrospective on uh CBS the other night just
 		i thing about her and different movies she'd been in and i realized how much i missed the old Doris Day Rock Hudson movies
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		they were just always i can remember never missing one at the theater
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and because they were like fantasy and and they were an escape from the real world i think and even if i see one on now or somewhere i'll want to watch it so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		oh they're those are some movies
 		and they come on uh every now and then
 		are you still there
 	
 	
 		yeah i am still here yes
 	
 	
 		okay it got real quiet i didn't know
 	
 	
 		yeah i was just kind of
 	
 	
 		there was no static or anything i thought no
 	
 	
 		i am in a rest area and i was just kind of looking someone went by there i
 	
 	
 		i thought i'd lost you
 		so you are headed up to Tennessee
 	
 	
 		yeah uh to Tennessee it's my mother's eighty fifth birthday
 	
 	
 		where about
 	
 	
 		uh Kingsport
 	
 	
 		oh okay that's right yeah um i work for TI and i have traveled to Johnson City before and i
 	
 	
 		you know where that is
 		oh yeah are they still there
 	
 	
 		um most of it was sold off to Simon's but there is still about five hundred employees that work that are TI
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i remember back when they first open in the early seventies there i worked at Univac and uh just down the road and boy all the everybody just
 	
 	
 		oh
