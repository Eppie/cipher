 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well what kind of exercise do you do
 	
 	
 		uh well on a daily basis uh at lunch time i take a brisk walk for twenty minutes along with a friend at work
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i am uh paying for a lifetime membership with President's Health Spa
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you're paying for it but not utilizing it too much
 	
 	
 		well i don't i don't get there very often
 		but um  i figure one of these days i will
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah i'm not i'm not currently uh enrolled in a athletic club or anything uh
 		i try to get out and do a little bit of running during the week uh when the weather is good or it's a little tough in the winter when it gets dark so early but
 		um uh i try to get out as much as i can
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum well i have an exercise bike um also that's that's in my my house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it just sits there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sits there and collects dust huh
 	
 	
 		um-hum not doing me  very much good
 	
 	
 		uh i i lived in Colorado quite a few years and i was more inspired to workout there just because the weather was
 		uh clear more of the time and and i like to stay in better shape to go out and do a lot of skiing and things like that and since i moved to Dallas i guess i haven't been as inspired  to get out and do as much
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well i i'm from New York and i'm a lot more inspired here in Dallas than i was there  because there's a lot more uh open space
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you just you just see a lot more people doing it you know outside outside all of the time
 	
 	
 		yeah i i find it kind of uh kind of a chore i guess to go uh uh on a regular
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		schedule to work working out inside i'd much rather be outside either bicycling or or running or doing that type of thing
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 		speaking of bicycling i saw a uh a video in uh Blockbusters
 		and it was something for you to sit on your bike and look at while you're you're um you're doing your workout have you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh is it like a scenery or something
 	
 	
 		yeah it's like you're going through hills or something and it's
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess you can put it in a higher gear if  you wanted wanted to pretend you're going up the hill
 	
 	
 		yeah have you  have you watched one of those yeah
 	
 	
 		no i haven't but i i have seen some things uh
 		uh advertised in videos like that and i've heard some athletic clubs have
 		uh have machines with a screen like that and that actually the computer
 		uh when when it shows you're going up a hill it actually makes the bike peddle harder and things like that
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and so it it uh trying to be a little bit realistic i guess they have the nice scenery like you know uh biking up some mountain road or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah um i keep saying i'm going to um rent one and maybe i i'll get to to get on my bike and and use it
 	
 	
 		yeah we bought a uh stepper and uh in the winter time i've tired to use that uh a couple of times a week just because it's so hard to get outside and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and do much in the way of either you like say fast walking or uh running i work downtown and it
 		not as convenient to get out at lunchtime downtown Dallas although there there is a Y very close i guess i could do that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well they have those steppers in President's although i haven't i haven't used one of them but i do see people on them and they they're supposed to be really really really a great uh workout
 	
 	
 		there they they do work you pretty good and
 		um other things i've used that give you pretty good workout uh the rowing machines aren't to bad and
 		one of the best ones although good for people who aren't used to cross country skiing those Nordic uh skiing machines give you a real good workout but if you are not used to that some people don't like it because they don't feel like they they have good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		balance i guess it's it it's better if you know how to cross country ski before you use those
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i've been on the rowing machine at uh President's and uh i i like that
 	
 	
 		what's the i've i've heard some other people uh not too happy with President's uh they join and then it seems like that they don't have a lot of good things to say about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well well one thing i find that you know once the first time i joined and went in there they they measured me and weighed and weighed me and all this stuff and wrote my name down on a little card
 		and they show take you around they show you all the equipment and then you never see hear from them again you know you you're really basically on your own
 	
 	
 		oh the
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know they tell you how many of these to do and many of those to do and then you you know they never like call you back and say well it's time for us to see how
 	
 	
 		yeah
