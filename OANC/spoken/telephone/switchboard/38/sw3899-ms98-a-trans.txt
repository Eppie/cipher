 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay i pushed it
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what do you think um we can do to uh prevent air pollution
 	
 	
 		well um i worry about incineration you know i worry that we're we're doing way too much of that although i'm not sure
 		the one thing that i have trouble with is wood smoke whether how whether that's a very serious one or not um
 		you know uh with
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know what i was talking to my brother in Denver
 		and he told me that they have restrictions on when they can burn their fireplace
 	
 	
 		well that's what i've heard it kills me  because i love fires and i and i really really care about pollution and i don't use anything that's got the the the stuff stuff the
 	
 	
 		yeah i couldn't believe
 	
 	
 		stuff in it you know the spray bottles and i uh try to do everything i can but that's the one thing that i think is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		very difficult is is uh wood fires because it seems to me that they were natural
 	
 	
 		yeah i can't understand
 	
 	
 		that's a that's a natural process and unlike unlike you know all of the rest of it but
 	
 	
 		yeah i just couldn't figure out how could they could restrict uh you know like a fireplace because a lot of places that's all that all the heat they have in their home
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that that that's what they have yeah  but um i you know i i am really concerned about it because you can you're beginning to well you're beginning to see the air
 	
 	
 		you know
 		well i know yeah isn't that terrible
 	
 	
 		and  and that's frightening and i know in California uh a whole lot is being done i don't know how well that's working and if all those things all those laws went through
 		about about the for the car manufacturers and everything and has that do you know
 	
 	
 		well i don't know all i know is that we have to have our car our car smogged every two years you know and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		but i think what they're gonna do is try to get the try to get the car manufacturers to make cars that you know use gasoline more more uh better and and more cleanly or use cleaner fuel
 	
 	
 		um-hum  well you think that they would be able to do that you know i think they could too you know they just  they don't wanna they wanna use uh
 	
 	
 		i think they can do that i i think
 	
 	
 		you know something that's gonna burn all this gas where we can buy more gas  you know
 	
 	
 		yes i think that's right i think that's right but it's scary what it's doing to to stone buildings
 	
 	
 		um um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know the the acid rain i mean destroying things trees are dying lot of forests are are dying of these uh in Canada and in in uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know about i don't know about in California
 	
 	
 		well i don't know about that either but uh i know i took a ride down Southern California just recently and it was just amazing to look you know like being up higher and looking down and seeing all this
 		crud you know it oh it's terrible
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah well and and i had not experienced it as much my son went to Pomona and he went
 		the school starts in the fall and that is the notorious smog season so when he first went out there about five you know five
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh a long time ago four or five years ago but anyway he he called and just said mother  now i know what they're talking about i mean this stuff you really feel you can't breathe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah it it it does it burns your eyes and everything but a lot of these trucks that's on the road now to i think they could do something to those because some of those trucks just smoke like heck you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but it doesn't seem like no one ever does anything about that
 	
 	
 		no i know and and as far as what i you know i do things about almost everything else but as far as the air is concerned i am trying to buy a new car but there are no cars available with clean fuel
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i can't do that um i just
 	
 	
 		no the electric cars i think that was a good idea i would really go for that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh yeah i would too but that and it it's not affordable and it's not out there
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 	
 	
 		and then i have stopped using anything  but pump sprays so that i'm trying to get i'm trying not to use that whatever that's called chlorofluorocarbons
 		some kind of  anyway that's that's hurting the ozone uh level i'm trying not to do that
 	
 	
 		i
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		the bad thing i do is wood fires
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh we have a fireplace here to i don't burn it every night usually i just have mine on the weekends or when i have company that we're gonna be in the house all day
 	
 	
 		oh no no no i didn't either yes
 	
 	
 		you know and it's just nice to sit in the living room with a fireplace going but um other than that i don't use mine
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but
 		no and i i'm not sure  i'm not sure that this is something that air pollution is something individuals can work on as much as they can on some of the other ones
 		uh like recycling or even water you know water use or saving water and that's what's scary to me
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		right right
 		yeah i know i think it's gonna have to be these large companies and uh-huh
 	
 	
 		large companies that's right industry and the car manufacturers
 	
 	
 		right right right right so
 	
 	
 		and uh that  we have less control i guess it depends on who we vote for and how we write
 		you know write letters to them
