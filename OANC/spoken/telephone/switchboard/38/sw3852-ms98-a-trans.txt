 
     		
 	
 		okay Ron welcome to the net and uh what did you do about your last auto repair oh and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		well Larry my last one unfortunately was a an expensive one because i had a brand new Lincoln Town Car and and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		a couple of ladies ran a stop light the lights weren't working properly it wasn't their fault but we they didn't run it we both had green and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car so
 	
 	
 		my goodness gracious that's
 	
 	
 		that was a huge repair bill
 	
 	
 		well that's still not enough for a total is it
 	
 	
 		i know i hated that
 	
 	
 		to get it's a very expensive automobile
 	
 	
 		so it wasn't enough to total it but that's my that's been my most uh
 		expensive repair probably in the last year with the except of just service work because i buy a new car every two years and
 	
 	
 		oh and do you buy one every two years
 	
 	
 		well i travel a lot so you know uh this last one i leased so i don't know and i leased it on a twenty four month program it's the first time i've ever done that but i'll probably go back to buying them because i don't care to lease them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		did this car have one of these expanding balloons or just are there normal safety belts in it that you had
 	
 	
 		no it has the expanding balloons
 	
 	
 		did that help you
 	
 	
 		uh it they didn't go off
 	
 	
 		they didn't go off
 	
 	
 		no i guess we weren't going that sort of upset me we weren't going fast enough according when i called the dealership about it and called Ford Motor about it but no sir didn't go off uh we were it was a bad rainy dark dreary day and
 	
 	
 		well what
 	
 	
 		and the street lights
 	
 	
 		but you were hit in the side weren't you
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that may be the problem you you might you may need to be hit from something the leaning towards the forward to uh activate it
 	
 	
 		yes
 		took off my whole front fender and hood and everything i tell you just
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		took it all off it was uh uh my my doors were okay front and back and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it did uh right eleven thousand dollars in damage it was a expensive then i get it back and two weeks after that i'm driving it in front of the local high school
 		and some young man just wasn't paying any attention and runs in the back of me that's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage  so
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		so i'm gonna get rid my twenty four months is up on this car i'm getting rid of this car
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i would think so that doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my golly how about you Larry
 	
 	
 		well i'm relatively fortunate about that uh here we somehow don't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season uh students move into town who are from big cities
 		and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks then they finally settle down and realize that they don't have to drive that way here and uh that takes the strain out off of everyone that uh is driving a vehicle
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i understand
 	
 	
 		and i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to uh take care of us in the winter time
 	
 	
 		i understand
 	
 	
 		uh i have a sixty nine Cougar and a seventy seven Pontiac so forth and i have to uh and i drive a Honda most of the time
 		and i have to make sure that uh salt and so forth are kept off of it and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well i understand that because i'm from West Virginia and we had the same thing up there continuously continuously salting the roads for snow
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i just i did i had this Cougar totally uh the body of it totally rebuilt uh to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh done and then it all repainted and then  winter got here and so i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off so i haven't had a chance to drive it very much
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but anyhow uh uh now are you gonna buy this next car or you going rent it a lease again
 	
 	
 		no i'm gonna i'm gonna buy it Larry i don't like the rental i think i'm getting ready to retire myself and i'm going to i'm going to be you know driving a car for longer so i usually drive a car
 	
 	
 		are you
 	
 	
 		for three years and  and anyway and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so but last couple cars i've only driven for two years so i'd leased this one for two years so i'll probably go back and buy one and uh this next car will probably be my retirement car
 	
 	
 		well that's an awfully big one that uh that one that you had the Lincoln uh isn't it too large for normal town driving
 		finding parking places and getting in and out the doors
 	
 	
 		well no sir not really not really uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		no problem at all my wife and daughter we have uh two Toyotas in the family one Nissan and we have the Lincoln and uh the not really no problem there at all as finding as far as finding parking places it's it's convenient in that in that regard
 	
 	
 		ah
 		yeah
 		well well that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips
 	
 	
 		yes it is and i'm and i travel i'm like a traveling salesman don't travel a lot any more but uh when i do take it it is very comfortable to drive
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm very much aware of that
 		um-hum
 		yes i'm sure it is because that's the way that i enjoy this Pontiac that i have it only has thirty eight thousand miles on it but it's very quiet and very smooth riding machine
 	
 	
 		yes
 		is that right
 		well my wife's Toyota is soon to be four years old it only has doesn't even have thirty miles thirty thousand miles on it so gosh been much in such good shape that'll probably be an eight or ten year car
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you do you feel that uh
