 
     		
 	
 		okay i pushed it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so what do you do in your lawn do you do it yourself or do you hire someone to do it
 	
 	
 		uh no we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time uh find that it's
 		really a little more economical and we have or i found that i have the time and i kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas i used to live in Arizona and it was very confusing very frustrating because i didn't have the
 		watering system and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment but over here we get enough water automatically you know naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers and so it's a lot more rewarding
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		yeah right
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well we do our own out here of there you know mow it ourselves and everything but um our water supply right now is bad we need rain badly
 	
 	
 		oh  that's right
 	
 	
 		uh we can water here and Patterson i can water on Tuesdays Thursdays
 		Saturday and Sunday four days a week
 	
 	
 		um-hum is is that enough during the hotter times of the year
 	
 	
 		so
 		it was this last summer yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh now if it we don't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but um yeah we do our lawn our you know mowing ourselves and everything and i
 		do our planting of bulbs and things for i can have some spring flowers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before and
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's been real enjoyable although i didn't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold um they'd freeze down and by the time they the flowers would
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of uh more of a problem than it was rewarding so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i'm gonna try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we have quite a few roses i just uh we in fact we just pruned them uh way down and i uh just uh uh had to replace on of them so i just bought that yesterday and uh probably go outside today and plant that
 	
 	
 		you know feels
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long
 	
 	
 		yeah those are enjoyable
 	
 	
 		i even had uh roses on my table for Christmas dinner
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 	
 	
 		which was really pretty you know  but um other than the roses i don't have too many flowers i plant gladiolas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		um those are nice
 	
 	
 		and those are always pretty but they get so tall and they they bend over so fast
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i haven't done much in in bulbs in fact i received as a Christmas present a a
 		a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water at any time and
 		and after it started to sprout put in sunny window and it's it just grew like crazy but i don't have any flowers on it i don't know how long that takes or if there's anything i need to differently but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 	
 	
 		it's just nice and green right now
 	
 	
 		um-hum well is it that one of those Amaryllis
 	
 	
 		uh no i'm thinking white narcissus or something like a paper white paper flower or something
 	
 	
 		no huh
 		oh okay
 		uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh so i don't know
 	
 	
 		do you have a big yard
 	
 	
 		no not really and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas uh they have just the the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard we have a pool in our backyard and we did plan it to where we have
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		some some play yard last over but it's
 		it's um you know very small but most of the houses here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard that's that's about the size of most of them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah right right
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um i guess we're kind of fortunate everyone looks at that with our yard at our yard with kind of a sense of awe like wow you really got you know some grass back there
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum well that makes it nice
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool but we don't have one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know but we just we just have
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		dogs and um  and grass and uh you know the cement work  and a little place that we made for a garden
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh yeah
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we do have a garden you know
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		it's just a small one you know but we  had a lots of tomatoes and uh zucchini
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh it's amazing it's amazing what you can get out of a little
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know it's probably about twenty by
 		i don't know
 		twenty by six something like that and it's amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but it was nice a few cucumbers
 	
 	
 		that's one part of gardening i haven't tried yet and i don't think this yard is a very
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
