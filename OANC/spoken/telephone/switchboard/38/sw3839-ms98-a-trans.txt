 		yes sir
 		well uh you mean that i did or had done
 	
 	
 		had the either one
 	
 	
 		either one  well actually um this whole past summer i've had my old outside of my house repainted
 		and a lot of the little minor wood things corrected
 	
 	
 		um-hum you
 	
 	
 		and just prior to that i had a a bathroom totally remodeled and rebuilt and uh so i've i'm bringing my house up-to-date really
 	
 	
 		how old is your house
 	
 	
 		we built the house in nineteen sixty
 	
 	
 		well that's not that old of a house but things do change from time to time don't they
 	
 	
 		no
 		that's right they they they do change and and the bathrooms you know if you have any water leakage anywhere can uh slowly deteriorate things and so you got to plug those leaks up
 	
 	
 		y'all have basements in Pennsylvania don't you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we don't have basements in Texas unless it's an unusual a very unusual situation
 	
 	
 		is that right well is the water level high there
 	
 	
 		uh no we build them on pier and beams as they up for few years back and then what's popular now is just called a slab
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we don't have snow to speak of
 	
 	
 		oh well we just got about a an inch inch and a half last night
 	
 	
 		if it snows in Dallas we won't we don't go to work and wait for it to melt and at lunch we have the day off you know it i'm serious we just we don't have any snow plows
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i see
 		i declare
 	
 	
 		uh the last home project i guess well a year and a half ago we bought a house that had laid vacant for about two years and had been
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well sad situation estate thing and we've kind of put the whole thing back together uh the biggest thing i did was uh refenced and redecked in the back
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh i see are you doing this yourself
 	
 	
 		are you kidding
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i'd rather sell an extra insurance policy than use a hammer and a nail it wouldn't be straight anyway
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i declare oh well
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		let's see and we we found a part time fireman and policeman and in their so so called spare time they moonlight
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we get a lot better price than trying to use a professional yellow page advertised uh
 	
 	
 		that's true these lot of fellows uh uh really really want to work pretty hard so they willing to come at little bit more reasonable prices i'm sure of that i just had some guttering also replaced on my home
 	
 	
 		personnel
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i actually replaced all the other guttering last year and and the piece that i did this year seemed all right at the time so i left it alone
 	
 	
 		have you heard of that continuous guttering they have now
 	
 	
 		that's what i put up this last time it's one solid piece about thirty feet long
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 		were you were you happy did they make it right there on your property
 	
 	
 		no it was uh brought out on a truck
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so i i it was it i have seen these things done they uh they come on great big large wheels i think of material and they roll it off
 	
 	
 		i haven't seen it done when we moved into the uh the house we
 		we got guttering bids we finally repaired briefly what we've got for less than a hundred bucks those guys were gonna sell me a three thousand
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		go ahead and uh they talked about bringing a machine out and just making it right there in the front yard and putting it up as they make it so i've never seen one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well this as i say this was already uh they had come out and measured it and brought out the two pieces at the correct length and all they had to do is mount them and then uh seal one joint where the two ends came together
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i just thought of a project i did my wife wanted an island in the kitchen
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well we the house isn't that new so i built a uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		a uh
 		a table
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		from the local hardware store we have a outfit called Home Depot which is probably local down here but i ordered a Formica top with rounded corners
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then they have premade and bevelled uh legs and braces and so i simply took my counter top and put legs on it and braces and and uh put it together and uh
 	
 	
 		worked all right huh
 	
 	
 		for and it worked just fine it was premeasured the legs were premeasured exactly the same length so it's level hold it i have to put two business cards underneath it  that's pretty damn close for an amateur
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's very very close i
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		as they say down south you done good
 	
 	
 		yeah had somebody come through and he said my gosh if you had bought that at a store it'd been seven hundred and fifty dollars and i got out for about a hundred and forty five i think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well that sounds great
 	
 	
 		so i was happy
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've got this uh the we were talking earlier about my house i've got one more bathroom to rebuild and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we also have a a a porch that extends out from our master bedroom that we want to rebuild it's uh taken a beating over the years and um now we're a little afraid to walk out on it because some of the wood is deteriorating
 	
 	
 		how nice
 		are y'all in the mountains
 	
 	
 		uh we're in between the mountains we're we're in uh what we're called Nitny Valley at Penn State i
