 		oh okay great i'm in Addison here
 	
 	
 		okay well good
 		you know our subject is on boating and sailing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and quite honestly with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat i have never really got into sailing or boating
 	
 	
 		i do uh quite a bit of sailing i own a sailboat that i keep parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop  and we take it out and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts but
 	
 	
 		oh do you well great
 		
 
 		well that's neat
 	
 	
 		i haven't really been taking it out recreationally too much lately  since it's i don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore so it's hard for me to get it somewhere but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		i've seen some nice nice sailboats the guy that used to live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years ago or whatever he had a sailboat used to park it
 		right in the uh driveway and it seemed i think it held probably uh it must have slept four people anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah this one is not that big it's a day sailer it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		stuck your body out the whole  it back into the main part of the sailboat but
 	
 	
 		i i understand
 	
 	
 		but it's there they can be black holes to throw money into
 		boats are kind of expensive to maintain
 	
 	
 		i'll tell you it's
 		oh they are and you know we have a swimming pool at our house and i think of all the time now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever that i put in there i just could not imagine a boat because i know it's a lot of maintenance
 	
 	
 		especially a bigger one the bigger they are if you get a big cabin cruiser or a big ski boat
 	
 	
 		oh gosh yeah
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		power boat then there's always uh stuff to go wrong with it the sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up but you still have to
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging uh everything that's in it it takes a  a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up but
 	
 	
 		you bet i know my wife and i were first married her aunt and ancle uncle aunt and uncle up in New York they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older
 		Chris Craft and we were involved every weekend in just uh as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping him redo this and refinish that we just worked all the time but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen
 		it was sort of neat we but i think that was the last time we were really involved in that was twenty years ago or twenty five years ago it is a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		well it's a lot of fun i think um just from the standpoint of  getting away from the dodge here and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation
 		uh to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it and but it's uh
 	
 	
 		you bet
 		i visited my cousin a couple of years ago my wife and i and our daughter
 		and he had a place on the Lake of the Ozarks and he had a boat and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i never seen so many boats in all my life people actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying and townhouse or condominium whatever they own and they they go boats i mean they go if they wanna go to a lounge to have a cocktail they use the boat
 	
 	
 		use the boat for transportation
 		they just go across the boat and get a and tie it up and go in huh
 	
 	
 		and that was sort of neat yeah that's that's that's true that's exactly how they do it they go to dinner that way go to all the restaurants that was sort of a neat setup i enjoyed that we spent a week with them i enjoyed that
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be fun
 	
 	
 		but i'm envious i'm envious of people that have the big boats and uh
 	
 	
 		i've just never  i've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat um once i get my son into and through with college he's gonna be starting uh Rice next year so he's going off but
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um once i get to that stage where i'm not paying for something else and uh i i don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where i've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it uh
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		i might do something differently i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them keep it and maybe consider getting a a better one for me uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		think you think you'd really enjoy it
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i would uh i the sailing part of it i like uh because it's so quiet
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and if you get a big enough one then you've got a little motor on it also
 		where if it's light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 	
 	
 		or if or if the wind dies you're not stuck in the middle of the lake i've with my little one i've been out there many times on a calm summer day
 	
 	
 		yeah that's great
 		
 
 	
 	
 		where all of a sudden the wind stops and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in and
 	
 	
 		oh i know
 	
 	
 		and that gets hot and and wearisome doing that and if you have if you're have big enough boat to have the little
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in
 	
 	
 		and putt putt  sure well that's neat  where do you work who are you with
 	
 	
 		but it's fun  i own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance uh out in Addison and uh
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		i'm a scout leader though so i'm i'm out with
