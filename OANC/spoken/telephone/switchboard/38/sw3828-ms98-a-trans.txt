 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today
 	
 	
 		well i'm
 		think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people
 		getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the time than they're
 	
 	
 		yeah that's
 	
 	
 		given by the court system but  i don't know with the economy the way it is i think crime can't do much but go up
 	
 	
 		no i have to i have to agree with you i had an occasion a couple years ago to hear the Richardson Chief of Police of Richardson Texas speak and you know it's a shame
 		a a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it and then when he gets caught he'll be sentenced
 		something like five to seven years but he gets five days credit for every day he serves i mean it's like a bonus to go to jail so subsequently a five year sentence means he's going be out in uh a year
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		on probation i mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to a stash stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate and uh when he uses spends
 		uses up all that and spends all that money then he uh starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing
 	
 	
 		well there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina the average serves six weeks
 	
 	
 		now see that's a you talk about that's a crime right there
 	
 	
 		well we see we don't have any room in our prisons so
 	
 	
 		well we don't either in Texas
 	
 	
 		they shuttle they shuttle them in and shuttle them out and they get them get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks and then they're they're paroled uh to make room for the newest criminals
 		and it just it it's just really absurd
 	
 	
 		well it it certainly is and uh that would be a huge concern you know i don't think the general public really realizes this
 		as far what goes on with our
 		criminal system our judiciary
 		judiciary system and everything else it's just uh it's terrible the way it is right now
 	
 	
 		i think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now so many different things coming in so many different directions
 		that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's absolutely or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it
 	
 	
 		yeah as far as steps to reduce crime if it's uh crimes like we're just been discussing
 		obviously we we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to uh take them off the streets but i don't think that's gonna happen because just like you said and
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		our state's a good example your state's a good example and it's just not gonna happen as far as the murderers
 		and people that commit rape and things like that i'm not sure what's right but i know that it's it's not right to put him in there and
 		let let him live for years and years and leers years before you do execute him or whatever because it's has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him and you know to
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		i'm sure he gets to watch a lot of TV and i'm sure they have uh
 		exercise facilities and movies and  and everything else you know they can
 		have a good time in
 	
 	
 		well i don't know what the answer is but i know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working so
 	
 	
 		no it really isn't
 		it's a big it's a big problem and hopefully something will come out of it
 		so i don't know
 	
 	
 		i hope so i don't
 	
 	
 		i'm uh i'm pretty much of a hard person uh
 		i believe in capital punishment i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone i mean you know if it's just downright outright
 	
 	
 		oh i definitely believe in capital punishment
 	
 	
 		oh
 		you bet i mean that's the only way to
 	
 	
 		it's when they it's when they're in on death row for nineteen years that i don't i'm kind of curious curious about what
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to uh take care of them and all you know it's just unbelievable
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah you can appeal now in North Carolina for almost almost a period of twenty years
 	
 	
 		can you really
 	
 	
 		yeah you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you i think the i think it's uh the average is eight to ten years to get it to the North Carolina Supreme Court
 	
 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		and then uh after that it goes to the  Supreme Court of the United States and that usually takes another four to six years so it's
 	
 	
 		oh i know see
 		meanwhile you're living in a country club situation perhaps you know
 	
 	
 		they're hoping i guess they're what they're hoping they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did but it just uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		we have a serious problem in we have so many problems in this state right now and and the the thing is the the fundamental
 	
 	
 		the drug problems that's another one
 	
 	
 		fundamental problem is the legal is
