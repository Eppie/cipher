 		uh yeah something about the school system here
 	
 	
 		right and now i'm sort of  don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage my wife's a school teacher so
 	
 	
 		well then i'll uh i'll walk softly
 	
 	
 		no you go right ahead because i have a lot of strong opinions on it too my wife teaches seventh grade
 		and you know
 		there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system i think the i don't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		for example my wife she has kids that are on drugs and course like everyone she has kids that get pregnant even  even in the seventh grade
 	
 	
 		what school system does she teach in
 	
 	
 		Plano School System but but to give you an example uh
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		you know one of her kids will come in and he's
 		you could tell he's just bombed out on drugs and uh she sends him to the principal's office and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says hey your problem you take care of it
 		you're not allowed to send them home you know if you do that then
 		your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever your you you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day and just it's it's a numbers game i don't think that's right if they're especially if they're interrupting the class and
 		preventing other kids from learning
 	
 	
 		well i think it's more of a there's a bigger problem here than uh
 		than discipline in the schools i think it gets back to the uh parental uh participation into the program
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		um to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District and it's a public system however you'd think that it was a private school
 		because they've taken it the best teachers and the best students they've taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district
 		and uh put them in this academy system and to get into the system's very difficult but once you're in uh they have they have self-paced programs
 		and so you have students that wanna learn and uh you have teachers that wanna teach and you have parents that are really interested in the children and basically uh
 		there's probably some discrimination if you wanna say that uh because  most of the people that are in the academy system
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh are Caucasian and because you have to test into the system
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and most of that's not all true but i'm saying a large percentage of them are and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about of these kids uh have college degrees at least one parent does
 		and so there's i think that uh that's my justification for saying that
 		the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're they're saying do your homework let me see it
 		don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah my son had such a tough time in uh
 		the school he went to but there was through it wasn't all the school's fault it was his fault also but we put him in a private school in Richardson and that that cost more that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters that was more than his college tuition was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh had to be done at least it
 		took care of him and uh threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and uh want to learn something
 		
 
 		but i'll tell you what there's a there there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today
 	
 	
 		yeah i think what we've done is um um especially looking at um the South Dallas area is that we're trying to bring the education
 		level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed
 	
 	
 		yeah i think we have that problem dealing in most areas which is unfortunate
 	
 	
 		and um that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you're not don't have the proper education
 		uh including uh
 		exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		database management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you can't function
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		you know so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world and the business world then says we're not going to pay you
 	
 	
 		well it's different
 	
 	
 		unless you have the education and then education and then then we what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself
 	
 	
 		sure well teachers you know they have a a tough row to hoe so to speak they just
 		are always fighting the system i don't know if it's better than any you know we came down to Texas from the uh New York area we were only there for a short time but my wife is from New York and she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything and
 		i think you know the schools in the east are really a lot better than the schools in the south i don't care where you're from and they they i don't know if they learn more but they certainly uh
 		they have a tendency to learn more and in that part of the country there is all nationalities
