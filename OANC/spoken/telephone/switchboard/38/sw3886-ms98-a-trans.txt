 
     		
 	
 		how do you get your news coverage
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well um most of what i do is um listen to the news in the morning when i'm heading to work um
 		we get uh we have two different stations here that run uh National Public Radio and i really enjoy the format in the morning and the evening when i'm driving home from work so that's where i get most of my stuff uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's pretty nice
 	
 	
 		yeah we we also subscribe to the newspaper of course so we get the Washington Post here and it's a pretty interesting newspaper
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh so it's you know it's it's uh between the two i generally do okay every great once in a while i manage to uh listen to the evening news but not very often how about
 	
 	
 		yeah that's just about all i get is the evening news and the and the newspaper sometimes i wish the evening news was like an hour long instead of thirty minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't blame you it's it's uh it's
 	
 	
 		but that would be nice to have uh um you know all is it an all news uh radio station
 	
 	
 		yeah and it actually
 		well no i it's i guess what is it it's um it's kind of a talk radio station it's run by a university here called American University or at least that the the general program that i listen to National Public Radio itself is um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a uh uh a syndicated thing that's run by a group that operates here in Washington uh but if you have any public radio stations in your area chances are pretty good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		especially in Austin come to think of it uh that you're going to be able to get it down there uh
 	
 	
 		i i guess i never i never really tried that it probably is on the AM i know it's not on FM
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i don't know whatever your you know it it the normally the public radio stations are gonna be down at the low end of the dial you know around eighty eight and uh and so forth and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		this uh the two radio stations that run here one is a classical station and the other i guess if you had to categorize it's kind of a bluegrass station or something
 		um but uh yeah that that's i'm i'm dead certain some station in your area carries it because every once in a while they'll do little special features on Austin it's a real interesting radio program because they they don't just cover
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's probably picking up um KLBJ that's a real famous
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um uh Lady Bird used to own it
 		radio station here but um they're not so much news as they are um uh as far as musicians and and things going on around Austin
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um well that's very interesting well this comes on right in the evening as i'm driving home
 	
 	
 		you know
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um what they do is they they give you uh about a five to ten minute news uh broadcast and then for the rest of the half hour they usually divide it up into two or three segments where they they cover
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um topics either of current interest or every once in a while they'll just do kind of an indepth reporting on on some uh particular thing like yeah like perhaps for instance how a particular city is doing or something along those lines yeah it's uh
 	
 	
 		some subject yeah
 		well not bad that sounds pretty interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah it's real good and it  it it uh the other thing is is is my politics are kind of liberal and and um so they have a tendency being public radio to
 		sort of take a look at things from the populist point of view as opposed to being terribly sympathetic to the government although the you you've got to give them credit they do a great job of showing both sides of the story
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh they aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves either
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is something i really admire so if you watch the evening news which of the news commentators do you tend to like the most
 	
 	
 		oh i guess Dan Rather i'll switch around i'm not really partial you know one like Monday i might have one and Tuesday i might have another one you know just to get a different view
 		you know or just someone different  but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'm the same way but the the evening news on TV it's it's really it's so short that you just uh i don't feel like you wind up getting enough and yet have you ever watched the uh McNeil Lehrer report on public TV
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		i sort of feel like that news program drags on too long
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's a little draggy
 	
 	
 		and uh with you know with their little round table discussions and all that sort of stuff and i must admit i i used to try to watch it used used to make me feel like oh well this is uh something i should be watching
 	
 	
 		yeah until it gets a little boring though i know there is something better on
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah exactly and
 	
 	
 		so it it's pretty nice in that the newspaper here it's it's it's only you only have one newspaper and um it's it's kind of biased
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um it it's all right
 	
 	
 		which way which which way does it lean is it conservative or
 	
 	
 		yeah it's very conservative i would say it's very conservative but you know being it's only you you don't have one in the evening and you don't have a choice
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know i don't i don't like that but other i have uh uh small newspaper community um that's oh it's it's um
 		uh just in this general area it serves maybe twenty thousand people and uh it's free and it's real nice
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		yeah i really like it you yeah it it's like the small hometown newspaper you know you can put your kid's picture in there if they had a birthday or or something like that you know or some
 	
 	
 		that's good yeah
 		well that's interesting
