 		i don't know um let's see have you seen John F Kennedy
 	
 	
 		no have you
 	
 	
 		no i wanted to go see that one i was hoping my roommate went and saw it and she liked it what about um Hand That Rocks the Cradle
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no and i like i heard some bad reviews on that
 	
 	
 		it's supposed to be kind of scary well let's
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah have you seen any lately  what about videos
 	
 	
 		no well i mean
 		um let's see
 		well actually i have seen one i'm trying to think of the name of it um
 		it's got Bruce Willis in it and um
 	
 	
 		is it a new one with him
 	
 	
 		yeah but i can't think of who's in it but it was real good
 	
 	
 		it wasn't Hudson Hawk was it
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh that was horrible
 	
 	
 		oh i haven't see that one
 	
 	
 		um it's the guy that's from In Living Color
 	
 	
 		oh even i mean Keenan Winey  yeah i guess so Ivory is his last name
 	
 	
 		i yeah well you you know who i'm talking about i'm trying to
 		well i can't think of it but that was it was really i thought i liked it because it was funny and they had so many it was i mean it was really action packed and it was bloody but they had a lot of um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like one liners and stuff but i cannot think of the name i'm so bad with names of movies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i had a little more time to think while they were trying to find somebody and you know i haven't seen i haven't seen um any current releases my husband and i just don't get out to the movies that much
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		do you have children
 	
 	
 		um no but we we're lazy  we like to rent and watch them and be able to rewind them and say what he say
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i hear you well Leslie there's um a ton
 	
 	
 		we saw well we saw Flatliners i like that a lot
 	
 	
 		gosh that's been out a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah and um let's see Awakenings did you see that
 	
 	
 		now what was that like
 	
 	
 		oh it was great it was real good it was kind of and it's a true story or so they say yeah about these people that that uh like
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		near comatose i guess you'd say and they uh with medication they're able to wake them up after after like twenty thirty years and i mean it's not a real action packed movie but it was pretty neat
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i remember the name of  it's called The Last Boy Scout it was with Bruce Willis and i can't think of the other name the guy's name but yeah it was good
 	
 	
 		ooh and did you like that one you did okay and
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to think well uh what about City Slickers since you watch  um
 	
 	
 		you know i've been wanting to i every time i go to the movie store to rent that it's all rented
 	
 	
 		that's the same with same with me
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i've been at least three or four times just to get that movie and every time i go i guess i must be going at the wrong times
 	
 	
 		okay well um let's see
 	
 	
 		i did see Beauty and the Beast  it's beautiful
 	
 	
 		well i want to go see that one but i'll probably wait for it till it comes out on video because i don't think i can get any my date to take me
 	
 	
 		yeah  just go to a matinee there's so many kids there nobody will notice notice that you're not you know with a kid i said there's there's so many people you won't notice you're not they won't notice you're not with anybody
 	
 	
 		well  that's why i'm
 		doing it well
 		yeah that's true well um what about did you see Dances with Wolves
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i saw that two or three times and then what's the other one Kevin Costner was in
 	
 	
 		hm yeah i saw that one too did you like that one
 	
 	
 		Robin Hood
 		okay yeah i've i've probably seen it about three times um-hum
 	
 	
 		did you that was pretty long one
 	
 	
 		yeah but i like Kevin Costner
 	
 	
 		how many times did you see Dances with Wolves
 	
 	
 		i only watched that once
 	
 	
 		you did
 	
 	
 		yeah and i cried
 	
 	
 		uh i did too it was so sweet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i could probably tell you more that i wanna see than i have seen what about um Fried Green Tomatoes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i wanna see that one too my husband kind of went hm
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		so he wasn't real excited about going to see that one have may have to go with my mom
 	
 	
 		well a friend of mine went to see is it what's the name of it Father of the Bride with Steve Martin and she said that was real cute um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah i'll probably wait for that one to came up on video it has to be real good for me to spend the money
 	
 	
 		what about the one with um Arnold Schwarzenegger whatever
 	
 	
 		which one
 	
 	
 		Terminator 2
 	
 	
 		oh i haven't seen that one either
 	
 	
 		well that's good i cried at that one too
 	
 	
 		you cried in Terminator 2
 	
 	
 		yeah at the at the end i won't tell you but  i'll miss that
 	
 	
 		okay  let's see have uh  did you say you'd seen Flatliners yeah okay what about let's see Edward Scissorhands
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that i saw for the first time uh uh probably about two weeks ago
 	
 	
 		i just loved that movie that was so sweet
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's cute then there're some what are some other ones i wonder
 		i haven't really seen that many new ones because
 	
 	
 		oh no i haven't either my in in fact we're supposed to get out to movies tonight but i don't know what we're gonna go see
 	
 	
 		now it's too late now
 	
 	
 		yeah well we might be going to a late one yeah
 	
 	
 		no well um trying to think what else i've seen
 		that's even i guess if i see them it's because they come on HBO or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah see we've got HBO and you they have to be pretty old to get on there
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		well i think so i think they have a lot of the same ones run over and over again
 	
 	
 		well see now Edward Scissorhands been on there like every week now
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i hate is they overdo it when you know when they get a major release
 	
 	
 		i'm trying
 		and then well what about the one with Tom Cruise in it that's an old one Days of Thunder
 	
 	
 		yeah i haven't even bothered watching that one
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah is it good
 	
 	
 		it it  it's okay probably have to be a Tom Cruise fan
 	
 	
 		is it
 		yeah well my dad is if you can believe that but i'm not a real Tom Cruise fan
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		nah he's okay but i don't think i don't see uh what i guess all the young girls see in him
