 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what do you think about drug testing
 	
 	
 		well
 		unnecessary a necessary evil i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that it's appropriate in some job categories uh jobs that involve safety and
 		you know that that performance of which really would have an effect on the the the lives and safety of other people you know health professionals and people who
 		uh operate machinery and fly and or drive whatever i think that those are really important i'm not sure how i feel about about other jobs just
 		uh for the purpose of determining whether or not an employee is
 		drug free you know on on general principles
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		but i can really see the justification for the others
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i guess i'm uh
 		partly biased since we just recently our company's gone to the uh process of
 		initiating drug testing on a random basis
 	
 	
 		uh-huh for all job categories
 	
 	
 		everybody uh in the corporation
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so whether you're an executive behind a desk or you're operating a vehicle or whatever
 	
 	
 		that's correct
 	
 	
 		and and how do they how do they do that how often generally does random mean
 	
 	
 		well it's uh
 		other than they uh they insisted on the uh you know management and
 		and supervision taking the uh being done within the first year
 		which we've all been done you know
 		uh seems to be
 	
 	
 		so in the past month
 	
 	
 		the past year
 	
 	
 		oh since nineteen ninety one it started is that right
 	
 	
 		uh right actually late in ninety it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you know they it's fairly infrequent it's just that it's there you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		when you say infrequent is it maybe once a quarter or
 	
 	
 		oh Lord no i don't think uh
 		first of all in my group
 		hardly a fourth of them have been tested you know
 	
 	
 		how large is that group
 	
 	
 		uh it's about uh twenty people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		so what do you see as the reasons that they chose to do that
 		that the company chose to do that
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		was it insurance issue or
 	
 	
 		that uh they want to you know social uh issues
 	
 	
 		safety issue
 		uh-huh
 		so uh on a performance level there was actually
 		a problem with abuse of substances and they wanted to make sure that they were reducing that or
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that
 		that was probably the prime motivation and insurance like you say to get uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		what kind of a company is it
 	
 	
 		Texas Instruments
 	
 	
 		oh i guess i should have figured  anybody i talk to in Texas is is probably  from TI
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		interesting well
 		they really i guess i shouldn't stray from the subject but they have some very interesting topics for for questions
 		i often wonder who has created them
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess there uh
 		may have been just a committee throwing out suggestions
 	
 	
 		was the response from the employees regarding drug testing favorable or
 	
 	
 		it was uh it was received at our site here in Houston
 		fairly easily however in Austin where they have a lot of engineers and uh
 		i guess a younger set uh people they uh they were pretty uh a lot of people quit over it and uh quite a
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		quite a bit of furor yeah
 	
 	
 		interesting quit on general principle
 	
 	
 		i guess yeah there was some people that just actually quit because of the
 		their uh objection to the policy being forced on them you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh is there some concern that the tests may not be completely accurate that you might be taking some prescription medication and and
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know how much of that there is i don't think it's that big of an issue because they've hired a national company and it's you know handled
 	
 	
 		be interpreted correctly
 	
 	
 		third party and there's supposed to be a lot of safe guards and all that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		do you know if anyone's been uh
 		um
 		disciplined or
 	
 	
 		oh yes they've they've they've been people that have been uh
 		the company has a
 		you get a two step process the first time if you're caught you have to uh take a uh you know go into a program to even if you're not you know
 		still have to go into a program even
 	
 	
 		so even if it's you know one time
 	
 	
 		yeah if you're if you're you're high you know if you fail the test whatever reason you have to go in into a program and uh course that can be very quickly taken care of if you're not a habitual user or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		then uh after that first time chance then the second time it's automatic termination so
 	
 	
 		seems fair certainly if people are prepared for the fact that
 		there's a chance they're going to be tested you think they'd be smart enough if they did have a problem to eliminate their use
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's
 		it's almost become a uh non topic anymore
