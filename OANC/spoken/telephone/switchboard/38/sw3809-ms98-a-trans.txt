 
     		
 	
 		okay you're probably uh more up on this subject than i am but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the roles that women have played the last couple couple of year in our are couple of generations
 	
 	
 		that
 		right well they've entered the work force more uh you know since World War Two is when they started
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		and uh i think that that is you know very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women
 	
 	
 		you bet you know where i've noticed it more i think is i'm a traveling salesperson and i have traveled most of my life and i know just especially in the last
 		oh ten years and really since the in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers i sell sporting goods and even in our industry uh
 		there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell and even in the last five five or six years boy you see more and more women being involved and
 		you know it's a it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things
 	
 	
 		yeah the you see more of that you see more of them uh leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		you know i i go to a i have a club that i belong to Altrusa that you know one of the girls travels quite extensively and she said well my children have two parents you know why not
 	
 	
 		you bet that's sort of neat
 	
 	
 		so that that's a i think that's a change and i think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing
 	
 	
 		sure i think uh it's the age age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on TV or something where the discussion comes out that
 		you know women are paid less than men and they're and they're doing the same uh
 		or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i that's a very true statement and it shouldn't uh it shouldn't be that way
 	
 	
 		right
 		no that that i think should change will change in the near future also it's been changing it's been evolving but there's still a an
 	
 	
 		and
 		i think so hope so and
 	
 	
 		an unequality in the work force in certain jobs it's you know and you hear some people say you know well he's a man he he he needs that salary
 	
 	
 		absolutely
 		you know i've
 		right yeah they forget also i think uh a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if if a a woman Congressman i'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way
 		but i guess just the most significant thing change for me again as i mentioned it was just in traveling you see uh more and more ladies all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going
 	
 	
 		and going yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i expect you're right in regards to having two parents now that's a good a good statement
 		and i think if in the future it's even gonna be uh more noticeable and more significant
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i i think it will be i think i well another another thing i read too the other day this is not just for working women but how much they're out there i guess is that car designers um are starting to design cars with women in mind
 		um because in the past the male bought the cars but now they're showing that fifty five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and that they are looking for um
 		different things in the car the man is looking for the engine in the engine and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		uh can her makeup come off the upholstery  and if they're out there buying that many cars then there's that many out that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working
 	
 	
 		good point
 		right now i'm self employed and and my wife's always worked she's a schoolteacher but for she started working and then when i first started my bidness uh she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know she certainly did her part in help getting me established in my business she still works everyday so
 	
 	
 		yeah we all do
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		i'm just happen to be off today so  i work too
 	
 	
 		uh-oh enjoying enjoying it  what kind of work do you do
 	
 	
 		i'm a nurse
 	
 	
 		well good
 	
 	
 		and i work at Medical Treatment Center um which is at Garland uh Jupiter and Arapaho
 	
 	
 		right married
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well well
 		trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		i'm kind of out of out of things
 	
 	
 		you see the old uh
 		cigarette ads you know about you've come a long way
 	
 	
 		you've come a long way baby
 	
 	
 		baby right and uh you think about this when you coming to a when it comes to a subject like that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's really true women have come a long way and you know
