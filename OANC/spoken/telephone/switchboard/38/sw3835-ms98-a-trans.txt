 		no um i i work for TI
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so that's how
 	
 	
 		well okay well um anyway um i'm with a a choir and and we've been doing this as a fund raiser i wasn't sure if they were still doing it or not but i know that's not what we're supposed to talk about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay i'm having dinner right now and and on the subject of food so just continue and you tell me something you'd like to tell me about food
 	
 	
 		well are you are you having a Super Bowl party
 	
 	
 		uh no i'm not actually i wish i were
 	
 	
 		well i was thinking now that would be a good place to exchange a recipe maybe  um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we're not having one this year either but um i'm going to one and this year it's pretty simple all i have to take is cheese  so i know i don't even have to make anything but
 	
 	
 		oh that's going to be easy
 		oh well i guess my my favorite recipe that i've seen this week was fried green tomatoes did you see that in the paper
 	
 	
 		no i didn't uh uh it's probably in reference to the movie i'm sure
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		um i know my husband has heard about that and thought that that sounded really good are they i don't even i've never had fried tomatoes
 	
 	
 		well you know i don't guess i have i mean i'm from Mississippi originally and surely you know i don't even know that i've ever seen it offered to tell you the truth and but this this evidently is a Southern delicacy that i didn't know about
 	
 	
 		huh
 		i didn't know about it either now we i have had um  marinated green tomatoes you know where you marinate them with onions and cucumbers but i don't i've never had fried
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		right
 		well i tell you if you see that movie it'll make you want them
 	
 	
 		fried green ones
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it just they just really make it look good now i love things like fried okra
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i try not to ever have fried things but still you know if i  i think uh that the fried green tomatoes would be something like that
 	
 	
 		are they pretty does it look like it's a pretty easy thing to make
 	
 	
 		probably you probably bread them and and uh you know like with corn meal and that kind of thing and then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		now i did i did go to a dinner this past weekend that was um
 	
 	
 		fry them in grease
 	
 	
 		at our church we had a church auction last fall and a lot of the things that were auctioned off were um services like a dinner for eight and then if you bought if you bought it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there were two couples that two or three couples that might cater the dinner
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and one couple in our church had lived in the Philippines um years oh eight years ago and so they um auctioned off a Filipino dinner
 	
 	
 		ooh nice
 	
 	
 		and um so it was really fun one of the things that we had were was fried um bananas but but not fried bananas i don't know what they're called but it's a it's kind of looks like
 		the dough that they use for egg rolls
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know what it's called but
 		they put bananas in there and with cinnamon and i don't know what else and sugar and stuff and then they deep fry it
 		and they use green bananas you know so that the bananas kind of stay together  and i have fixed fried bananas before
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		as a um Cuban or Spanish dish
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and they're really really good
 		but um when you were talking about fried tomatoes it reminded me of this the fried bananas that
 	
 	
 		oh i bet that was good i know i would like that
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah it was really a fun a fun thing to do a fun way to raise money
 	
 	
 		do you work um in any particular what particular what area do you work in
 	
 	
 		i'm up at Spring Creek

 		is it a girl movie i mean is it is it something my husband would enjoy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well it's either one
 		yeah uh-huh it it has it's a story that would appeal to both men and women uh Dave liked it a lot huh
 	
 	
 		because he doesn't like going to see girly movies like like  um Steel Magnolias he didn't want you know
 	
 	
 		oh no now but my husband liked Steel Magnolias but it was more like this is more like Driving Miss Daisy did you see that and um and this probably is even a little more
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		masculine than than Driving Miss Daisy even but it's that kind of movie that has just a universal appeal
