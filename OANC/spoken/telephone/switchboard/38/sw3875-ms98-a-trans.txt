 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um you know we uh use to use live bait in in California and they do use some live bait here but not a not uh whole lot not like you know you use to use in California and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i haven't i haven't been fishing since i've been to California because i have been having my kids and

 		you are oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		i only want to have to teach two of them how to fish i don't want to have to teach four
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh that's we use to have a lot of fun when i was actually my my two boys were born here in Texas but
 		uh my two girls i use to take them with me when when uh we would go fishing you know and my wife and i use to like fishing off the pier and stuff and we'd catch uh shoot one time she she caught a couple of sharks off the pier
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know we caught uh what do you call uh those flat things
 		and we you know we'd get crab and stuff off the pier and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's that's stuff that we that we miss being here in Texas we don't have much of a chance to get out to the coast and and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's amazing how few women actually fish
 	
 	
 		yeah my wife loved to fish she didn't like to uh she doesn't like to put the bait on but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know that was my job i just put the bait on and she'd catch the fish  in fact we use to go out and and this was not really that funny at the time but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's funny now you know i'd we would get two poles
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i would you know i hook hers up she would be out there and i haven't uh i i wouldn't even be able to tie my hook on
 		she'd catch a fish and she would yell at me to come and take the fish off so i'd take it off and walk back and put my hook on she'd call again to get the fish off her hook
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean it went like that for a whole hour
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband gets kind of upset because him and i have an agreement
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i i'll bait my own hook and i'll catch the fish but he's the one cleaning them because i won't clean them that's the only thing i will not do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		he gets really disgusted because he he says i i talk to the fish i don't talk to the fish they just jump on my hook
 	
 	
 		you'd talk to the fish
 	
 	
 		that's what he says because i'm really lucky at catching them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		no matter what kind of fishing we are doing i i seem to have really good luck and it's like i don't talk to um and they just jump on my hook i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh that's my wife
 		yeah that's my wife uh every time we go fishing she's the one that catches them and i'm the one that takes them off and baits the hook and  then it goes all over again so
 	
 	
 		yeah my mom got remarried and she got remarried to uh a commercial fisherman
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		and he was like women don't know how to fish and da da da da so him and i went out fishing one day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i and he goes do you need me to bait your hook and i said no i can handle it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i baited my hook and by the time we left i had six and he had none he goes
 	
 	
 		oh my heck
 	
 	
 		he goes he goes tell you what
 		why don't you do my job for a while
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i said no thanks cause i don't clean them
 	
 	
 		oh that's funny
 	
 	
 		so he cleaned them all and i gave him and my mom four of them and i just took two of them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but he was just so disgusted because he had never seen anybody that had that good of luck
 	
 	
 		now do you like eating uh eating fish
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i love fish
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		i i grew up in Arizona so i guess that's why because
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
