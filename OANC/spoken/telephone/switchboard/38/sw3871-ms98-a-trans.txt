 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what do you think about recycling
 	
 	
 		well it's uh certainly would would help things out uh i don't see a terribly lot of it going on uh here
 	
 	
 		i don't see a lot of it here either
 	
 	
 		i was actually quite surprised i went to uh San Francisco recently uh to Berkeley and and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they actually have mandatory recycling well no theirs theirs is not mandatory i'm sorry uh but you know it was just incredible to see  everybody with you know with with ten bags of things and they they have a community recycling center uh where
 		rather than than having monetary incentives for the the people that actually bring stuff into recycling they're just doing it to help out the city and then the city can use that money you know any money that they can get from that goods that are recycled
 	
 	
 		well i think if they had some place up up in your area like i know they don't here
 	
 	
 		yeah no i would i would be glad to but you know we have no place convenient at all i mean i am not really concerned about making money off it um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i mean that that the amount of money that would come out of it is not really enough to make it worthwhile
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		it's just the recycling per se uh we do very little uh recycle newspapers  but other than that
 		kind of a shame
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we we do our cans and stuff but um
 		um you know i don't know if there is someplace close by where you could take everything i know in our neighborhood every so often every few months they'll put in our subdivision they'll put out um
 		like dump trucks so you can get rid of your trash and garbage in your yard and they'll haul it off for you and it is all free if they did something like that and they they'll get a chipper you know like in the spring and in the fall
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		if they did the same thing for recycling i think that would go over real well
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i think you know i think that if they would have sort of neighborhood or or semi neighborhood recycling centers that is what i saw in Berkeley was it was real interesting it just had uh bunches of bins and and uh
 		in different in each for different thing uh uh you know they even had a specific specific of course being in wine country they they even had wine bottle recycling so you take the wine bottles and the the the wineries would actually buy you know take those bottles back directly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 		and recycle them
 	
 	
 		yeah not and not to have to melt them down they just reuse them uh but they had things for for different types of paper and they had things for the aluminum and then for plastics and
 	
 	
 		were they all over the community
 	
 	
 		apparently yeah there there you know there is only a matter of maybe ten fifteen blocks away from where these friend of my lived and and they just save everything up and took a trip over there and they they didn't get anything for it but but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know the thing is that a center like that i am sure it would be self supporting if uh you know just off the proceeds from from recycled things
 	
 	
 		well it couldn't like glass companies buy the glass back from uh the city or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i am saying you know they could pay for it you know if they have to have someone there occasionally to kind of keep an eye on things or do stuff
 		you know that that salary could easily be paid out of the money that comes from uh selling glass or or aluminum or whatever
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh you know they even had uh they even had a little little shelf area for recycled books where people brought books they didn't want put them on the shelf and people just come and take anything you wanted off the shelf and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'll be
 	
 	
 		it was uh quite quite an operation
 	
 	
 		well that's pretty neat maybe it'll catch on all over but i haven't really seen it around here hardly at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no no i
 	
 	
 		um i have seen where one um i think trash company will put out you put out a bin but it it was never explained what you put in it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and do they really you know i haven't seen a special kind of a truck oh in this area now i've seen them uh around Austin uh some they're they're like three division trucks you know it has three compartments
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh oh i haven't seen those now i i i think i have seen them actually going with like a sack on the side where they are picking up aluminum cans people put them out separately
 		and they'll they'll toss those in a in a bag on the side of the truck or something but
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		hm yeah i i i think that there is a little bit of you know of of you know i think that they the emphasis on making money from recycling
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is is a is a little bit wrong certainly there is money and value to somebody but i think that the average consumer probably doesn't want to spend the time and it is not enough money to make it really interesting anyway and so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um you know i think they they ought to make more of an emphasis on on convenience as opposed to to uh you know to trying to give people money for it
 	
 	
 		yeah i know i know if they did something like that at work you know if they separated paper where i work they don't even separate the paper
 	
 	
 		oh now that we do we where i work we we recycle the cans and bottles and and paper but there's a lot of computer paper generated so it's you know generally clean white paper
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		now see they don't even do it where i work for a private laboratory and you know that uh ordinary office paper which they go through a lot of it and they they shred all of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know and i would think you know and i see them carry them out
