 
     		
 	
 		yeah i pushed in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so how do you use your credit cards
 	
 	
 		oh we use them
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		for paying our gas
 		for paying
 		uh just about anything because um we don't like to pay for our checks  so we use it quite a bit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but we we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get the the credit cards
 		if there's a monthly or a yearly charge we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free so we never have to pay anything extra
 	
 	
 		yeah that's me i won't use one that i have to pay an annual fee
 	
 	
 		yeah we just don't think it's worth it
 	
 	
 		you know and um i'm uh like you i i use it
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well to buy my gas with my Shell my Shell credit card i use that
 		and then like my Emporium card and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Weinstocks card i use that but i'm like you i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill why i don't just write a check i don't know
 	
 	
 		see well you i don't do it either
 	
 	
 		you know it's just really weird but i i don't carry a lot of cash with me because i'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes exactly that's how i feel i mean it's a rare day when i even have seventy five cents in my purse
 	
 	
 		yeah you know enough for a phone call and that's about all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		other than that that's the that's the way i use them i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got they can't they can't charge any more
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and i think that's terrible
 	
 	
 		yeah because it's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit why
 		it really does help
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our Visa or our MasterCard or whatever
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then um you know we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it we come out a little even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because you there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		they're going to hit you over the head
 	
 	
 		yeah even if it's five bucks even
 	
 	
 		i know it just uh  you know it just seems like they're somebody's always watching
 		so i just don't i don't carry money i'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it's twenty four hours you can report it in
 		and i he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you can have your card back with
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		and you know some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		you know i don't know why they don't unless you have to spend a certain amount i don't know but i notice that some of them don't even look you know they just slide it in there and pass it back to you
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		you know so i don't think that's right i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know
 	
 	
 		yeah sure i mean it's just a precaution for everybody
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 	
 	
 		well let's see what else can i say about credit cards
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		oh i also use like to use Discover when i can because uh you know they give you some money back every year
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i don't uh that that that's that Sears Discovery Card is that what that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah now i don't have that one you know
 	
 	
 		well we just started doing that and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know what it comes in handy is for when you're buying things like um tickets for the train or um airplanes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because they'll give you some money back you know and it's only a little bit but i mean it's still something we got two fifty last year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so it's you know it helps out here and there
 		so
 	
 	
 		oh you mean uh  for for you using your credit card you get like a rebate or something
 	
 	
 		yeah they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing but when you you know when you add up everything you've you've charged up on the Discover card for a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and so that's what
 		and i know we're going to get back more this year because they
 		you know we spent a little bit more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		probably and they do it for how long you've been a member i think too
 	
 	
 		um i see
 	
 	
 		and they increase the percentage a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'll
