 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i guess we're uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution i hear that
 		the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting fuels fuels are being experimented with ethanol and
 		other types of fuels
 	
 	
 		yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from
 	
 	
 		i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories but i
 	
 	
 		or sources
 		that's what i would think
 	
 	
 		i don't know for sure i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from what comes over the border from us
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i think the automobile definitely is an area
 		uh any any industry that burns you know
 		and then i don't know about chemical pollution i'm not real
 		into that as far as how it affects the air i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution they have offices that are too well insulated they found people are getting sick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i don't know if that affects outside
 		you know i i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories
 	
 	
 		yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes um i guess there's been a lot of pressure to um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do away with the CFCs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah that is well that's destroying the ozone isn't it yeah
 	
 	
 		again i that's what i hear and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the ozone or not but at last i heard it was
 		uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially
 	
 	
 		yeah that's it it's kind of scary
 	
 	
 		well it is scary and i think it will uh
 		continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces
 	
 	
 		i i i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that  in Los Angeles they're apparently going to they've passed laws that for habit for example people using
 	
 	
 		i think it will
 	
 	
 		barbecues gasoline lawn mowers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles and it's gotten bad in Denver and and uh it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars and our economy seems to and this i think is one of the big problems
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah in this area too since you know in Texas we're so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in Colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts but we're even getting it here we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas
 		and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets
 	
 	
 		well that makes a lot of sense i mean i i hadn't thought about it that way but it it
 	
 	
 		you don't have to have mountains there stopping it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh they make uh making more and more high-rise buildings and uh
 		so yeah we can comment and we didn't see this a few years ago it was pretty clear here
 	
 	
 		no and i think yeah and i think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth
 		which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a  a whole
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it and uh we're going to feel it and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a
 		big structural change in the economy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars and in in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i'm i have a little sports car that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but
 		i think uh we're gonna have to make some fundamental changes and and i'm i'm not sure
 		how long it's gonna take or what it's gonna take because they keep saying that the economy
 		is gonna depend on how many cars and houses we sell
 	
 	
 		yes and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that it's a lot of waste but
