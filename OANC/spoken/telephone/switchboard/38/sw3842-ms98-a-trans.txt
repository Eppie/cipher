 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh what kind of lawn and garden work do you wind up doing
 	
 	
 		i have um we own a house that we rent out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and i i rent the house that i live in
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and the house that i'm renting the house that i live in had the landlord provides the yard work
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		the house that we own i provide the yard work
 	
 	
 		okay this sounds kind of like  slightly jumbled situation there
 	
 	
 		i know  well the the one that i live in is not nearly so nice as the one i rent out though
 	
 	
 		uh that good income huh
 	
 	
 		i wanna preserve the the the value of the house by making sure the yard is taken care of
 	
 	
 		yes
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so i i go over to my other house and mow the yard and plant bulbs and flowers and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		do do you enjoy gardening
 	
 	
 		i adore it
 	
 	
 		yeah it's real relaxation
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh my father ran a service station for thirty nine years and his
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean when when i was a kid i didn't realize how true it was but he always said that that was the best way he knew of to wind to wind down after a hard day at work was to come home and put in a hard day in the garden
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and especially you know just hoeing just hoeing up the weeds it was  therapy to him
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i guess it still is but uh
 		and i didn't seem that way when i was like ten years old but
 	
 	
 		did you mow the yard when you were younger or do stuff like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah um we had about a quarter of an acre worth of lawn between our my my parents' house and our next door neighbor
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they were a rather elderly couple so we cut their lawn for them
 		but uh
 		there's about a half acre worth of garden we kept
 		so when the kids and
 		dad we
 		we kept it worked up pretty well it was a lot of fun as long as you know  your heart was in it at least least to some extent or another
 	
 	
 		do you still do yard work
 	
 	
 		well uh since i moved away from home i got to live in a place that had a yard
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so  i not really
 	
 	
 		do you do anything anything like um uh house plants or
 	
 	
 		yes we've actually gotten to the point where uh for a while i couldn't seem to keep anything alive
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i couldn't even grow weeds in the house
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but about three years ago my wife and i somehow another seemed to have turned into green thumbs we got we pinched off a uh a couple couple of a twigs from a house plant of her mother's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		and wrapped them in a wet paper towel and brought them home with us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and put them in a jar of Miracle Grow and water and these this thing took off and we planted them and now it's a plant uh  plant we pinched them off of was kind of full and leafy but it was only about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		eight inches high off the top of the pot this thing's about five feet tall now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		ooh what is it
 	
 	
 		and i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it it's this you know some little broad leaf something or other we
 		but uh it's it's got real thick thick stalks to it that like i say it's the couple of those stalks over five feet tall
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh they're just growing like mad once we got that thing going we wound up with about five or six other house plants that are all doing real well some people gave us some aloe vera and it
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's doing well i mean it's had it's bad spots but
 	
 	
 		i killed an aloe vera
 	
 	
 		uh it's had its rough times but yeah but it's it's doing real well now um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i brought her a uh a couple of
 		i don't even know what they're called looks like overly large lawn grass but it just a broad leaf type of along net kind of like a a leaf on a stalk of corn but greener it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah um corn plants those are called corn plants or or Dracaena or they're some kind of Dracaena but common name's corn plants i think
 	
 	
 		short house plant pardon
 		yeah well it doesn't get a stalk the the leaves all come out of the center it doesn't really resemble corn other than the shape of the leaf itself it is about like the shape of a leaf a leaf on a stalk of corn but it's not on a
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		stalk it's just all out of the center
 	
 	
 		huh that's i don't i know i have one of those that's not doing very well but
 		i think i know what you're talking about
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh it doesn't seem to flower any and let's see we've got a little somebody gave us a Fichus and uh
 		uh when we first got it no well we came close we got really close
 	
 	
 		you you haven't killed it
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um when we first got it she kept moving it back and forth from our own front porch to the uh inside and she never could quite decide where she wanted it inside
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it had shed almost all its leaves it looked really scraggly and rough and when somebody finally told us the only way to treat those things is to put them some place and leave them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
