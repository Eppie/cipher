 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well
 		credit cards
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'll tell you what i i can't say a whole lot about credit cards because
 		i uh tore mine up
 	
 	
 		is that right i i know people i know some other people that have done that
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i got in some problems with uh
 		financial problems because of credit cards so i
 		uh basically just got rid of all of them i i have a a couple i have a uh gas card that i that i use just for gas and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know uh one that i use just for
 		emergencies but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i have i have we have some some friends that did the exactly the same thing they uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed and finally they realized that they were
 		they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole and they just cut them all up except for for one they kept for emergencies and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they're still paying away to get out of debt
 	
 	
 		i know it
 	
 	
 		but
 		no i did just the opposite i i guess i i sort of followed in my uh
 		parents' footsteps i have quite a few of them i use them continually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i uh i basically never charge anything i don't have the money in the bank to pay for
 		and uh and i always pay them off totally every month yeah
 	
 	
 		oh is that right that's a that's a good policy
 	
 	
 		yeah and it you know i mean they they're just a convenience for me i don't have to get cash out of the bank and i don't have to to be writing checks and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah uh sometimes i wish i had them but in most cases i'm glad i don't because i you know unfortunately i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i don't have the control you have  i wish i did but but i don't uh and it you know it i just don't want to get into that situation again so we'll
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		yeah i mean it it's easy i mean you don't have anything transferring just a little signature so what you know
 	
 	
 		oh that's it see and that's even with my gas card you know i find that i'll go in to get some gas and i'll end up buying you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever and then at the end of the month i you know i get a bill and i'm thinking what did i get
 	
 	
 		right
 		surprising
 	
 	
 		that costs so much
 	
 	
 		yeah well you know but the i mean there are sort some inherent limits there you're not going to you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that right
 	
 	
 		and
 		
 
 		yeah
 		that that's true but i can i can understand certainly understand where
 	
 	
 		now i with the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know  uh not so much discipline i mean well i mean you have sort of a discipline in general about finances but but i hate their their rates so badly i mean their interest rates so badly
 	
 	
 		you know
 		oh yeah isn't it that's unbelievable how let me ask you this how how old are you
 	
 	
 		that i
 		i'm uh thirty three
 	
 	
 		thirty three
 	
 	
 		thirty two excuse me
 	
 	
 		okay
 		you'll be thirty three this year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you want to be thirty two as long as you can huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's coming
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i i know what you mean about the interest rates it's uh it's unbelievable
 	
 	
 		you know i just that just irritates me so much that that i refuse to pay them interest and and my wife recently uh
 		decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off and she's from there and and uh didn't really have the money but you know she could pay it off and so i sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards but she's paying it and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i just won't do it i mean she's paying i don't know i don't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest and i just you know i just refuse to give it to them if i need to borrow that kind of money i'll go to the bank and uh
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 		
 
 		yeah and then you bet
 		that's uh yeah i in fact i've i've even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less
 		uh rates
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i i guess there's some there's uh uh some negotiating there too because i heard uh on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh
 		call you know if you've got a pretty good rating uh credit rating
 		you can call your in you know your your card wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees or i'll just go to somewhere else
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
 		well i might
 	
 	
 		you know and if you've got if you've got a pretty good uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh history with them
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they're more than willing to do that
 	
 	
 		hum i might try that because i i have one card that i've had for about uh
 		i don't know nine or ten years
 	
 	
 		yeah in fact that's that's what this guy you know he wrote a book on it and he says that's you know he's tried it several with several of his cards and he's just told them you know i i can get this card from this bank
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		at this rate and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it does not make sense for me to do that and if you won't drop my rates i'll just go ahead and send you back your card and i'll go somewhere else and get it
 	
 	
 		yeah for me the big thing you know is the uh uh
 		is the uh the annual fee and i just refuse i won't get any card now i've i've got a good rating and i've got  you know and i'm not going i'm not going to pay an annual fee the only one i actually pay on is this one that i that the very first
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
