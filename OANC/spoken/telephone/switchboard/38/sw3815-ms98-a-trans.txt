 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well are you in the market for a new car
 	
 	
 		uh well yeah i am as a matter of fact  well actually actually i'm looking for another car but uh uh new probably not
 	
 	
 		oh what sort of requirements to you have for your car
 	
 	
 		uh sports car  uh usually either black or red
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		and and electric windows and power locks  no
 	
 	
 		i see
 		top of top of the line
 	
 	
 		well uh not so much that as it is i've had so many times when uh uh you know i i'll have a friend next to me or i see somebody
 		uh guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it is just a real pain or you know if i'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and uh somebody that i know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive reach reach over and try to roll down the window
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and uh so power locks and power windows are just  just things that uh uh just really help a lot  what about you
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		well i guess i'm um more traditional in that i don't like power  power windows or power locks because  the people that i know have who have them always seem to have trouble with them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um  so i don't i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work  and then i want you know good uh gas mileage and i want an air bag and
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh i guess a good
 	
 	
 		have you ever had a car with an air bag
 	
 	
 		no i haven't have you
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		somehow i just think you know i like the idea
 	
 	
 		well it it seems sure seems to save lives and uh  yeah i actually i like the antilock brakes
 	
 	
 		right
 		right that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		and i've never had a chance to i have been in cars that have had them but  i've never tromped on the brakes to see uh you know on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh you think you'd buy uh an American car or a European or Japanese
 	
 	
 		well i actually i don't know a lot about different brands i tend to have you know my requirements like the last time i bought a car i i guess i did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically you know good repair record
 		good mileage um
 		and i needed air-conditioning and um
 		can't remember what my oh i wanted uh stickshift
 		and so i didn't have a whole lot of choice there was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that
 		you know was sort of a medium priced car with a stickshift in it it it turned out to be a a Chrysler um
 	
 	
 		what was that
 	
 	
 		Lancer
 	
 	
 		huh stick shift huh did it have what a three speed or a four speed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no a five speed and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so i guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move
 	
 	
 		well actually i much prefer a stick shift
 		and what i'm i'm curious i i know why i love a stick shift why do you  why did you want one
 	
 	
 		well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one and i thought it would be more reliable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		it's hard to find stick shift cars anymore
 	
 	
 		i found that out  i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when you went in to and they asked and said that was the requirement
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah no i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area not that i was looking for sports cars but  now the people i've talked to  don't seem to have stick shift
 	
 	
 		huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and so why do you like stick shift
 	
 	
 		um i guess i i grew up on it and it's fun it's it's an enjoyable part of driving i do feel like i have uh more control
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		over the car and it it to me it gives me more a lot more control in the snow and ice and slick conditions
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh it it it does uh i don't know it it's really more fun than anything else as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right and actually it's probably safer on you know uh long trips because it keeps you more active
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah  uh of course i like gadgets and and uh fun things on on the cars which are all the things course the could
