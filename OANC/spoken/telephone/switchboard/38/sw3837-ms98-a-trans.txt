 
     		
 	
 		well have you taken any vacations that you enjoyed lately
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes took one in October and uh drove flew into Los Angeles and drove up the coast
 		to uh through Monterey and San Francisco and over to Lake Tahoe and flew out of Reno
 	
 	
 		okay so you went up like the Coast Highway for a way and then then went inland there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh was really great
 	
 	
 		is is that was that a new area for you to visit
 	
 	
 		most of it was because i had uh seen parts of northern California and i'd been to San Francisco but never along the Coast Road
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was quite exciting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my husband said he didn't know whether he wanted to ever drive it again though
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's the
 	
 	
 		have you been
 	
 	
 		it's scenic i guess i i've i've been to a part of that on a trip to San Francisco i i went up just a short ways up the coast to i believe it was Point Raid
 		uh National Seashore i think it was
 	
 	
 		um i don't remember that
 	
 	
 		and i only had about a day so it was just a short drive up from San Francisco and back when i was out out for business
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well we went uh we liked Monterey very much and uh it was just kind of a relaxed pleasant town with a lot of things to see and do and
 		and then uh the Muir Woods on the other side of San Francisco um that's another really bad drive but it's it's worth going to
 	
 	
 		uh the the Redwood forest there
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		what part of the country are you from
 	
 	
 		originally from Texas i was raised up in Dalhart
 		so uh anything that doesn't look like flat plains is uh like i told someone once i always thought Dallas was real green
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because it was the greenest place i'd ever been
 	
 	
 		are you currently living in Texas
 	
 	
 		oh yes live in Dallas
 	
 	
 		okay see i'm in Texas too but
 	
 	
 		where are you from where do you live
 	
 	
 		in Richardson
 	
 	
 		okay well you're just a  a suburb of Dallas
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well we uh my family and i moved here about three years ago we lived in Colorado and
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		uh and that's a good vacation spot too  but it was nice living there
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 		well we uh when our children were young we used to go to Estes Park
 	
 	
 		yes i i didn't live too far from there in fact i bicycled from my house to there a time or two uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		how fortunate you were
 	
 	
 		uh from Boulder i lived in Boulder Colorado
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		that's that is one beautiful place
 	
 	
 		uh i i uh didn't probably take advantage of it as much as i probably would if i moved back  you kind of take it for granted when you live there but
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i did enjoy the skiing and and the and the winter sports that that was available there
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i've never skied my husband keeps saying we need to go but uh we have never done it yet but uh everyone who does says it's great
 	
 	
 		yeah it's enjoyable if you do it more than once or twice so you get past the learning stage so you can start enjoying it it's a little bit frustrating when you're falling a lot but after  after you get past that it's a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		you have to enjoy the cold snow in your face huh
 	
 	
 		well it sometimes can be yeah it it uh
 		you can get some nice days skiing as well though if if you're not falling you can stay pretty dry and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it can be pretty nice the dry climate doesn't feel near as cold as as it does here in the winter time to me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think that uh no the dampness course our humidity is sort of medium compared uh well where i was raised is extremely dry
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but my brother lives in Houston and
 	
 	
 		it's the the other extreme
 	
 	
 		yeah so we're kind of in-between but uh my mother always said that Dallas was extremely humid to her
 	
 	
 		yeah it's i i agree with you it's sort of in between yeah after having lived in Colorado a lot that was a little dryer than was probably comfortable it's a bit little too dry and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and this is actually a pretty good climate humidity wise in in the Dallas area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		have you gone on any vacations lately
 	
 	
 		last uh uh summer we uh we went uh and took the family to Cancun in Mexico and uh we really enjoyed that trip
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		have they uh we were we were there when it one of the first times it was open they were just building the hotels and
 	
 	
 		well it's pretty built up now
 	
 	
 		i was afraid it had become so commercialized
 	
 	
 		yeah it probably was more enjoyable when you went before it was too too built it's it's a real strip hotel strip now out out on that island
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		did you go over to the Isle Mujeres
 	
 	
 		uh yes we we took a sailboat uh catamaran ride over to Isle Mujeres and they took us around let us shop a little while and then took us to some snorkeling uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 		oh did you get to go out to that reef
 	
 	
 		spot
