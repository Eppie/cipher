 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um
 		what have been some well i'll start out with some of my my vacations um
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um when i graduated from high school um my uh band my jazz band and we visited Europe i visited Germany and Austria um Italy
 		uh Switzerland
 		and that was pretty fun i also have visited South America
 		and just this last summer one of my favorite vacations is i went to China
 	
 	
 		oh boy you're a real world traveler here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so uh i i we my wife and i when we went to China we visited the Great Wall and uh the Forbidden City
 		um
 		the Forbidden City is uh  right there Tiananmen Square is right in front of it and so that's where all the
 		killings occurred not too long couple years ago and uh also the Forbidden City if you saw what was that one movie that was really famous
 	
 	
 		all right
 		oh yeah um emperor or  yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		The Last Emperor yeah that was filmed in the Forbidden City so we had to see that when we went anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah that was a
 		well my wife and i are right now saving for a trip to to England
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds fun
 	
 	
 		we would like to stay about a month uh
 	
 	
 		you'll need to save for that unless you have some friends there you're going to stay with because
 	
 	
 		well we do have some friends that we can stay at their place for a while or as long as we want actually but it's you know it's in the southern part so but we want us to go all over the countryside
 		that's our next big vacation we've got planned and just a few days in the London itself is all we're interested in there
 		but mostly to this date uh our vacations have been more like uh anywhere where there's not too many tourists
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i hate resorts
 		and things like that i like to go where you can get out by yourself in the mountains done a lot of camping in New Mexico and uh Colorado
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and one time we even toured Iowa my wife is from Iowa
 		but actually the southern part and uh she'd never really seen a lot of the different northern places and just the lot of the little towns and  so we drove around went to the Humana Colonies things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah they're not too far from here
 	
 	
 		we really i think she enjoyed it a a lot because she knew more of the history than course than i did of Iowa but
 		it was uh it was interesting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		here in Texas we live in the middle of Texas it's hard to get out of Texas on a driving trip
 	
 	
 		yeah got to go a long ways  uh yeah we also don't like to particularly go to tourist spots fact we usually choose to go places where
 		we at least for part of our trip will be visiting someone and uh even when my wife is well
 		and my graduate program that i was in we knew some people who were in Beijing
 		and so uh
 		we were able to stay with them for part of the time in fact they spoke English very well and and helped us around to see some of the places
 		and even when we went to South America uh
 		uh
 		we knew there were people contacts we had there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh
 		but most people that i that i uh met you know at the university and so uh
 		it makes a big difference to us we like to go for go on a trip with someone who's from the area because i don't know i've i'm afraid especially if i don't know the language
 	
 	
 		right we had had a we went to Mexico City once by ourselves
 		uh mainly because it was just something we could afford to do and
 		we heard it was interesting well we just had a real awful time because we didn't speak Spanish i don't think that would have helped us any anyway
 		it was just a miserable vacation and we decided you know we'll never go anywhere where they don't speak English or somebody that can't help us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was by the end of that week we felt like everybody was out to get us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that sort of thing and we weren't having the fun we thought we would
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it really makes a difference because i know even when we went to China when we crossed the border we went over to Hong Kong we were so relieved it was so fun to be uh
 		you know it seemed like returning to civilization and where a lot of people spoke English and uh  just the general living conditions were were somewhat higher also so it was uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		our last
 		major vacation was uh well we had to go to Iowa to see some relatives because sickness in the family so we took that in for a few days and then we went to a uh
 		to a Shaker settlement in Kentucky
 		and uh it's a it's been rebuilt and we stayed there for three days and it was just kind of neat because we really like Shaker things and we were able to take our dog with us and he stayed with us and
 		it was just the thrill of our life to it was early fall and Kentucky was beautiful that time of the year anyway
