 
     		
 	
 		any pets
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i have one Chihuahua that's fourteen years old
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		i have two cats
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		there's been a time when we had as many as like four pets when our children were growing up and everything you know but they died off one by one and that's it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		i bet you're attached to your Chihuahua
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah cause they're just they are kind of like a baby you know they're
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they are so little and cute
 	
 	
 		you have to carry them around you know they can't do a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah they are so little and cute
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		right uh but well our cat died two years ago and she was eighteen years old well i am telling you this because you have cats
 	
 	
 		wow yeah eighteen
 	
 	
 		so she lived a long time
 	
 	
 		was it an inside or outside cat
 	
 	
 		well uh kind of both uh
 	
 	
 		that's what mine are
 	
 	
 		she had always been almost an entirely outdoor cat except we have a little door you know where she could come in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but then as she got real old then she went out less and less and then not at all you know the last year or so
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah mine are two characters they're only
 	
 	
 		what do your cats look like
 	
 	
 		oh i have one that is a calico and she is not very friendly
 		and i have one that is uh uh yellow and white long hair
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in the summer time we have to get him shaved and it's the funniest looking thing you have ever seen
 	
 	
 		oh yeah to you to have him skin i mean his hair
 	
 	
 		his fur shaved because he he mats up so bad
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and he doesn't lick his coat
 	
 	
 		he doesn't
 	
 	
 		and he gets great big old knots all over him and then when you go pick him up he looks so funny
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it looks like a cat going out for aerobics
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		cause they don't shave you know their legs
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i don't think i have ever seen a cat sheared like that
 	
 	
 		no it's real strange
 		
 
 		they call it a lion cut they shave it all the way to the collar
 		it's really funny he's real friendly he acts like a dog
 	
 	
 		oh my i bet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do your cats get along well
 	
 	
 		no they don't like each other at all
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they really don't that is really strange
 	
 	
 		oh now we do a lot uh we our daughters are like in their late twenties and one of them has a Shelty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		so any time she is traveling or she is working a lot or whatever all kinds of reasons
 		her dog is here a lot  you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh its a very pretty dog you know looks like a little miniature collie
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that looks just like Lassie except in miniature
 	
 	
 		oh neat
 	
 	
 		but uh it is a real pretty little dog but uh i don't know if all of them are that way or not its a real shy dog it really only likes like my daughter and us you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		otherwise it'll go hide
 	
 	
 		yeah  well that is what my cats do when company comes they hide
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh i uh now cats it is more usual i think to do that i don't think i have ever known a dog that would this i mean she is so shy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		shy
 	
 	
 		or what roommates she has had and all if the dog comes out and sees it is not my daughter she goes back under the bed she won't even come out  that's why we have to keep her so much because she won't come out for anybody else
 	
 	
 		oh my word that is shy
 		wow
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		does your dog and your daughter's dog get along
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they don't uh
 		uh i mean they know each other and all that but they i mean they don't play or anything but my Chihuahua is older she doesn't care any thing about playing we have promised her that
 	
 	
 		get in each other's way
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she we are not going to get any more pets until she is gone she is going to be an only child
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because every when we got her she was like one of four pets
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and now this is her time
 	
 	
 		right right we had a
 	
 	
 		well those are so cute i just adore them
 	
 	
 		yeah well of course this one's
 	
 	
 		do you carry it a lot with you in the car and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh yeah trying to make a long story short we stopped at a service station several months ago and then when we got home i said well you get the dog i will get the baby i had the grandchild in the backseat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		no dog
 		the dog had hopped out at the service station to go to the bathroom and uh we didn't know it until we got home and i mean you talk about somebody being frantic and upset and
 		and it took us three days of walking that little town and talking to everybody and handing out posters and pictures with pictures of the dog
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 		how'd you find it
 	
 	
 		well somebody looked at the picture on the poster well not poster i made you know xerox copies looked at the picture and said i saw that dog Sunday and he directed me to who
