 
     		
 	
 		what are you cooking for supper
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh boy that's a good question i haven't figured that one out yet
 		personally i'm thinking of making a goulash
 	
 	
 		that sounds pretty good
 	
 	
 		but i'm publishing a cookbook right now so or getting it ready to go to the publisher
 	
 	
 		what type of food
 	
 	
 		all types
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		different nationalities there's going to be a different section for each nationality
 		it ranges anywhere from Midwestern cooking to Japanese
 		there's some Scottish there's some Scottish in it some Scottish dishes that i know some Russian some for babies you know how to make baby food instead of buying it because it's so bloody expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well i'm kind of a house husband and and i cook everyday
 		that's about the only thing
 	
 	
 		i'm a housewife
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i'm a housewife
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		everyday too
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		i've got two little boys
 	
 	
 		today i made a banana cream pie my wife gets testy if i don't have some sort of dessert in the house
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i made banana bread two days ago and it's gone
 		everything i make disappears real quick so i guess people like it
 	
 	
 		yeah sometimes i i make things and they don't work so i kind of throw them away before anybody sees them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i'm a i i don't know i live out of cookbooks other than stuff that i've cooked over and over and over
 	
 	
 		yeah well see a lot of people do live by cookbooks not just house husbands but like bachelors and stuff they don't know how to cook anything you know unless they have a recipe to follow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's why i'm publishing this cookbook because it's simple recipes
 		it's nothing that's hard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just everything in it is really simple
 		you are
 	
 	
 		sometimes i like to get a hold of a very hard book uh
 		and hard recipes especially some of the French dishes
 		and where i've got to read it reread it and then keep it out while i'm cooking
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know something new not something i'm going to fix every day or something
 	
 	
 		just something for a special occasion
 	
 	
 		right
 		but i guess i know for like twenty years i my wife and i both been fixing a a chicken dish from the Philippines and
 		it's really really strong with garlic and black pepper and
 		we've always thought nobody would like it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		we recently served it to some guests we had and and uh they all had to have the recipe
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and i didn't go easy on anything
 	
 	
 		that must have made you good
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's delicious it's like when it when it's like birthday time and you say well what do you want to eat we always say Chicken Adobo and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just it's very pungent thing and and we just didn't think anybody would like it but they all went nuts about it and i've already heard that two of them have already fixed it at home so
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well my husband went to chef school before we got married and he can cook all kinds of fancy dishes and i can because i went to cooking school too but i
 	
 	
 		maybe
 	
 	
 		i favor the Midwestern kind of cooking because i grew up country so that's what i like to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		where did you grow up in the Midwest
 	
 	
 		well i grew up in Arizona
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		on a ranch on a ranch and it was a horse ranch and we cooked country style you know i mean you don't peel your potatoes when you cook them in the country you just cut them up and there you go
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think a lot of the lot of the things that i cook and that my wife cooks they're they're from Midwest from Iowa from her background
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because that's where we picked up the recipes and we have a lot of regional cookbooks from that area
 		so it's especially when we're baking something boy we just go to those little city cookbooks and we know they've been tried and tested and and everything so
 	
 	
 		yep
 		well my mom published a cookbook when she was married to my dad which was about ten years ago
 		but um
 		and she published hers so now it's my turn
 		i'm trying my luck
 	
 	
 		uh we lived in New Mexico northern New Mexico for eight years and
 	
 	
 		anywhere near Alamogordo
 	
 	
 		uh no we lived up at Los Alamos
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so and then up in the mountains but we picked up a lot of uh
 		Santa Fe type dishes and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's usually what we'll fix if company's coming because they uh they expect it
 	
 	
 		there's some really good food that comes out of there i'll tell you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we don't even like to go out to the Mexican restaurants around here
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there is none around here that's really Mexican
 		they're all fake
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		you know and when you taste the food you know it
 		there's just a difference
 	
 	
 		in this part of the world there's you know there's a lot and there's some from the interior of Mexico and country Mexican cooking and things like that so
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		you can get into some unusual things but i still find that you know especially even when we go back to Santa Fe
 		that i'd rather have the food from there they just use more cheese and more beans and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		well i live in San Diego and it's right near the border
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you'd be surprised how fake the restaurants are out here they
 		knowing how close we are to the border i mean you only have to drive five minutes to get to the border
 		you'd think that there'd be good Mexican cooking here
