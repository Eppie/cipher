 
     		
 	
 		go ahead Vickie
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well um i had planned a very successful cousins reunion i have a lot of cousins and i did that several years ago in fact it was so well received they've been really having a pi fit for me to do it again
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i've never actually got to plan one but i've came to several back here in Tennessee that uh were planned long distance with people you know because my immediate family is like five states
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they've all turned out pretty good  and  this time we're here for my mother's eighty fifth birthday
 	
 	
 		good
 		oh how neat
 	
 	
 		and we had a big dinner today about thirty people and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh is it going to be over a several day period or was it over several
 	
 	
 		uh well the birthday was today and tomorrow one of our nephew's one of my nephew's is getting married so
 		a lot of people came from well to Florida Virginia and Texas and Tennessee here for that for both occasions
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum well that's kind of nice to be able to do that to for both occasions my my uh family
 	
 	
 		so it's been
 	
 	
 		um my father's family  uh he had five or six  oh i let see six brothers and sisters
 		and uh when my grandmother died we found that we were not getting together except um  just when somebody died
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it was only funerals and so it was kind of sad so about i guess it was about two or three years ago i planed this cousins reunion and how i my my cousins even though we're all
 		fairly close there's only two or three of them that's out of town and out of state
 		uh i we didn't keep in close contact  and there were sometimes well let's see one one family had five and one family had four children and the rest of us were you know like two and three
 		and uh
 		so i just sent to the oldest child in each you know uh in each family
 		uh my oldest cousin in every family to uh to send me their
 		brother's and sister's names and addresses and their names of their spouses
 		and i got good pretty good response from that had to do a little phone work and then i just sent out a real neat little memo to everybody
 		and one of the cousins helped cook the meat the meat and everybody brought a dish
 		and uh i it just worked out really really well
 	
 	
 		i i'm actually one of sixteen kids so and only nine of those kids belong to my mother
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they were all here in Tennessee today the first time we have all been together for a snap shot in
 		well forever it's been in my memory yeah
 	
 	
 		well i i can imagine it's hard to get that many people together
 	
 	
 		the last time we had a legitimate family reunion one of the sisters couldn't make it so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		everybody had pictures of everybody together but her
 	
 	
 		oh shoot well how often do you all do you have try to have like reunion
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so today we
 		well
 		it's kind of like your family sometimes it's just funerals and and and special occasions but the last family reunion was in eighty five and i'd like to see another one get going
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i was going to you know now that the subjects been brought up uh  about five years ago it was actually i didn't get to attend this but i was so wanting to but several of my sisters had got together with some other people in the neighborhood we grew up in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we had a community park  and of course we all rode the same buses and stuff and they had a block or like a community reunion and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum oh well that's that would be fun uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i didn't get to attend because i was in the process of moving to Texas over that same weekend and uh but they said you know it was a blast and they sent me pictures
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		it was you know people we grew up with and uh people came from all over the place to get back for that one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i don't know about you but neighborhoods just aren't like that anymore and if you can you know get together with an old neighborhood like that that is really neat
 	
 	
 		yeah i would love to i mean i just love to you know stories about the kids i grew up with but uh i'd like to see i'd still like to see them yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh sure and and to find out what happened to everybody right um-hum
 	
 	
 		well at the time you know all i could do was tell them hey well Sam's moving from New Mexico to Texas and this that and so the other so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well one of the fun things i did was when i sent out my invitations i mean they weren't like invitations i just did it on a
 		on a plain sheet of typewriting paper and i took old photographs of my cousins um when they were little real little and just did kind of a collage
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on on that you know and just just printed it on uh a real good copy machine uh you know you they weren't really good pictures but that you could tell who everybody was and it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and everybody got a big kick out of that because there were a lot of pictures that i had that nobody else had had
 	
 	
 		hum a few years ago my wife's family and they're off in a little town in Missouri  and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they planned it for several years and actually had a book made of peoples stories and where people went and photographs that went back about two hundred years and uh and of course
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that would be fun uh  was that it wasn't that wasn't a genealogy book or
 	
 	
 		it was no it each each family that lived in
 	
 	
 		it was it was different than that
