 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh oh
 		are you still there
 	
 	
 		yes i'm still here
 	
 	
 		oh i know what it was the answering machine must have run out of
 		
 
 		i i heard something click and i was like oh no it disconnected us
 	
 	
 		well that
 		no i think i think it's on i'm i'm so glad i got hold of you i want um something came up at work the other day people are wondering how to choose a college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i was wondering how what did your parents do to help you choose a college
 	
 	
 		well to be honest they didn't really do a lot i mean my dad sat me down i guess in junior high and said
 		um that i guess they had called him from the school and you know when they start giving you all those standardized tests and everything and you know Dad said well you know you're a smart kid so
 		you're going to college and you're going to graduate school so decide now what do you want to be  here here are your choices you can be a doctor a lawyer an architect uh he gave me a list of choices all you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the different professions and i was kind of like i didn't even know you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i had no clues so i said dad
 		well i can't stand the sight of blood so a doctor is out and uh i'm not i can't do math so a lot of stuff is out um
 		i didn't think i'd be a very good architect because i like to draw but not that way so i said well i guess i'll be a lawyer because i think they help people
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		boy was i stupid
 		so Dad said okay fine you're going to be a lawyer
 		so then when it got time to you know get close to you know you start getting college brochures and stuff  my dad kind of said well uh what's the best law school in the country
 		and all his friends told him Harvard and he goes okay well i think you should go there for undergraduate too
 		so i was like okay fine
 		so i like uh send them the uh you know do the what do you call it
 		you know send for the things you fill out and filled out the forms and um they interview you they always have one of their alums interview you and at the time i applied you had to do it through Radcliff because
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		used to Harvard was for the boys and Radcliff was for the girls
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and even though they were combined
 		you know even though they had to let women in Harvard you still had to apply through Radcliff so
 		i did all this and uh a Radcliff alum here in Dallas  did my interview and basically Harvard has a recognized and constitutionally upheld quota system
 		and they told me that i was provisionally accepted but that if that they got a black person or Hispanic person or something that was qualified from this area that i would be bumped because i'm just a basic you know
 		wasp type person so  i'm not really
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know they had this minority recruitment thing
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so and sure enough about two weeks before school started i found out that they had taken uh they uh found a black girl
 		and uh took her instead so the only thing i could do was i had to go somewhere that you could pretty much register and start the next day so
 		University of Texas was where my dad went to school and luckily it's kind of that way so i went down there and late registered and basically started classes the day after i registered
 	
 	
 		so you got to choose a college twice
 	
 	
 		yeah by myself
 	
 	
 		good grief
 	
 	
 		i mean my parents didn't really you know my dad was the first
 		well my mom
 		they were the first people in their families that had been to college
 		which i know like people from the east coast
 		colleges are all around you you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so everybody goes to college or it's more normal i think because a lot of my friends that are from the east coast you know everybody in their family's been to college but out here you know in fact my mother hasn't really been to college college they had a junior college
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that was fairly close by and and so she that's all she ever did was go to junior college
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		just you know two year college and and got her degree but you know then my dad went back to school and finished school and went to professional school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that was after my brother and i were already little kids so nobody in my family really knew how to advise me
 	
 	
 		that was the same way in in my family of course my parents were divorced so it was just mother and my grandparents
 		but one of the key things then was what could we afford to do
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and i got a a co-op
 		deal at one of the schools in New Mexico and i was there for a couple of years before i flunked out
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well where did you go to school in New Mexico
 	
 	
 		New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and that choice
 	
 	
 		i bet that was neat
 	
 	
 		yeah it was but men out women numbered the women about twenty or thirty to one
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh it was just a very small school about three hundred students but the big the reason for choosing it was because of the financial aid that was available
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it
 	
 	
 		that is really critical these days i think
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		but then i
 		my next choice in college was hey i move back with home with mom and i i went to the local university to get my grade point back up
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so a decent school would let me in
