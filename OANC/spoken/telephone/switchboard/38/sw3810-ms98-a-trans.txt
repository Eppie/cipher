 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		why don't you tell me about your choir
 	
 	
 		oh okay well we uh are a group of uh musicians that just kind of have you know formed out of a desire to sing
 		and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh others have there's one gal that's in the uh Plano Community Orchestra
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh  just you know different backgrounds it's been really kind of interesting
 	
 	
 		great
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		um i play the piano
 		and uh i have a four year old who who has started to play the piano
 		he does that uh musically listens and then he can play which is kind of interesting i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh  my husband and my other son who's eleven  just got through singing in a musical here in in the community at Music Man
 	
 	
 		oh they did
 	
 	
 		yeah and it was lots of fun
 	
 	
 		how did
 		how did they get involved in that
 	
 	
 		um
 		basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions it was the Plano Repertory Theatre
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band
 	
 	
 		oh how fun
 	
 	
 		so yeah it was really fun and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school  and my daughter takes piano lessons too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh we just really like music it's a i i especially like it as an outlet when the TV goes off we  get the TV off and and just have some nice quiet music
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah that's nice you say have your four year old taking lessons already
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh who do you have her or him take it from
 	
 	
 		um i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is an auditory type learning experience you listen to the music and then learn to play it by learning by hearing the intervals and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i teach uh
 		like what is traditionally taught you know you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano
 		but he can't learn like that he's a delayed child he's only about
 		i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it
 		uh with his right hand we went wow we better have him do something do something you know educationally
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that was really fun my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown though
 	
 	
 		well because my
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		so my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taken piano lessons since the started out at the age of
 		just turning five because she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally she just
 	
 	
 		oh i think that's great
 	
 	
 		so i wasn't sure when to start her i didn't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene
 	
 	
 		that's really hard i think because especially if you start them and then they get pretty good and then they get close ten you know eleven or something and they go i don't want to do this anymore and you're like
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		God i really want you to do it  you know so sometimes it's hard to to know exactly when but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah i think she'd like to i just don't know if it's really
 		knowing from what my daughter has gone through she's she learned a lot and it course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it it was something easily forgotten so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight  or or should i say seven i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's gonna excel just naturally she does have to really work at it but
 		um so  yeah  uh so i'm kind of you know just playing with it but at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but
 	
 	
 		that's like me
 		well it can get expensive that's for sure
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i my friend is is very generous in in letting us have my children uh do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's been good for our family
 	
 	
 		well as a piano teacher do you have any feelings from kids who come from a Suzuki method have you had any former Suzuki students
 	
 	
 		i don't have any Suzuki students um
 		something happening to me at Christmas time that that verified to me that i will always
 	
 	
 		i was wondering how they
