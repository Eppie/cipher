 
     		
 	
 		um what
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		things are you looking for in a car what kind of car would you buy
 	
 	
 		well right now i have a uh small Toyota Tercel
 	
 	
 		for your next purchase
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think next time i want something just a little bit bigger uh perhaps mid size i really don't don't like the the real big cars
 		i'm thinking about maybe a Volvo
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well it's funny because i currently also have a Toyota Tercel
 	
 	
 		you do
 	
 	
 		um
 		when i first got married my my father gave
 		me and my wife a a
 		a used Toyota um Corolla
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we used that until we  until it's about run into the ground and then we um bought a used um Toyota Tercel i was still a student at the time and um so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um you bought what we could afford
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and
 		i think definitely um now we would also get a a larger car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		how did your uh Corolla hold up
 	
 	
 		oh
 		very well
 		um
 	
 	
 		for real
 	
 	
 		it um
 		did very well i mean
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do you remember how many miles you had on it in the at the end
 	
 	
 		uh yeah it was about a hundred and fifty thousand and it may have gone further but um
 		it was very reliable though for us though
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		my my Tercel now has a hundred and forty six thousand miles on it
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i really haven't had any trouble out of it except the alternator went out at about a hundred and twenty six thousand miles i think
 	
 	
 		oh that's to be expected i would think
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		hopefully hopefully it just doesn't  happen at a a bad time  i mean when you're far away from anything or something
 	
 	
 		right and um it's really been great i have had no problems with it you know except little little minor things like you know belts and course you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh did you buy it new
 	
 	
 		actually i didn't i bought it from um Hertz Rent A Car and it had like twenty six thousand miles on it  when i bought it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i see but well sounds like it's been a good deal for you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		another thing i may consider the main thing i look for in a car is reliability
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and
 		um i just go by what my dad says he's a mechanic and i remember growing up and and but he's always never wanted to spend a lot on a car because i grew up in a fairly large family six kids and we just didn't have a lot of money to spend on cars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um i remember growing up and having like Ramblers and stuff like that and think they're the most unreliable cars that ever existed i mean ours broke down all the time luckily my dad was  mechanic and he could fix them but i remember
 		he said he said he would never buy um a foreign car but then in nineteen eighty he bought a used Toyota Corolla
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i mean didn't even spend very much money for it i don't think he spent more than five hundred dollars for it but he said it was the most reliable car he ever had purchased
 	
 	
 		wow
 		right
 	
 	
 		and he has bought nothing but Toyota Corolla since that time
 	
 	
 		uh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and so um
 		but i don't know my feeling is that American cars to keep up at all are becoming more reliable also so i may consider buying um an American made car
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm trying to consider that uh that could do to the plight of General Motors and all of that
 	
 	
 		my next my next purchase
 	
 	
 		i'm really trying trying to consider
 		but i don't know i i i don't want to have to spend a lot of money for car repairs
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		i have a cousin yeah one of my cousins
 		is trying to tell convince me that um
 		the American made cars are becoming reliable reliable but
 		uh i'm not i'm not sure i just i know for example that both my Corolla and Tercel have been very good
 		um and reliable that that i've i've used
 	
 	
 		have you heard that uh or do you know anything about the foreign cars being easier to steal than the uh the American cars
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because there's a lot of of um car theft going going on in Dallas right now i don't know about in your area
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm in Iowa City Iowa very small town and i don't i don't know if there's even uh more than a
 		one or two a month i mean um that's that that's not a big consideration here and i just moved from Utah where i that's where i was going to school before and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		also there um there's i've never had that concern
 		um so i'm not really i'm not really sure
