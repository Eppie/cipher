 
     		
 	
 		all right i guess this is a great time to talk about fitness with everybody and their New Year's resolutions and going out and getting their recor regular exercise program um do you recor exercise regularly
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		uh
 		uh yes i do uh
 	
 	
 		and tell me about that if you would
 	
 	
 		well unfortunately i have a cholesterol problem and uh i for a long time i did aerobics
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but a couple of years ago my uh doctor says no don't do aerobics any more ride the stationary bicycle so that that's what i do for thirty minutes a day i average six days a week
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow
 		well that's great that's fantastic do you have that set up where you can uh listen to some music or read a book or you just uh go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh definitely oh definitely uh it's it's boring
 	
 	
 		well good  so you're good you're using it
 		yes  because you don't see a whole lot on a stationary bike
 	
 	
 		no no
 		uh and i i also belong to uh the Texas Club and uh so some days i uh i go over there and i work out with the the Nautilus weights
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well uh my goal is uh three days a week but usually it boils down to about one day a week
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		uh do you have a regular regimen
 	
 	
 		well you've got me at a disadvantage i do not have a regular regiment i do exercise periodically but it's
 		whenever i have the time i uh i have a problem in that i don't make the time and i i understand the importance of it and in fact when i was in high school and college i was
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		on all sorts of athletic teams and and regular programs but since i've gotten into a new job and into my uh career
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and into a young family time seems to escape me right now but uh one thing that i really enjoy
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is that uh i have bicycles and i have two older boys that they like to ride bicycles with me and we ride as a family
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum
 		yeah oh that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		and you know uh i actually live in Plano but i'm working here in Dallas and they have some excellent bike paths
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		where you can go and ride for miles and miles and days and days and not see the same scenery twice which is really fun
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh one thing that i've been doing also is that
 		mind you it's not regularly but uh i like to go out and go jogging and i do that and the boys get on their bikes and uh we we
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they ride along and i jog along and it's a nice time to spend some some time with the boys too so i'm trying to coordinate
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know my family time in conjunction with my exercise time exercise program and uh we really seem to enjoy that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's extremely important
 	
 	
 		and uh there there's a couple of reasons for that is my boys are very sports minded even at their young age and uh one of them 's in soccer and the other one just loves to do it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so we get out and and do this and it i found out that it's very helpful to them also
 		in my oldest boy's soccer league that uh he doesn't seem to run out of breath as much as the other boys do and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he can stay in longer
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		and uh so i i don't have a a regular one but i i really would
 		like to set my priorities straight i guess and and set aside time to do that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i thought of different things i thought about going at the same time every day in the morning if i am generally uh getting up and heading off to work around six or six thirty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which means i'd have to get up way early in the morning in the wee hours of the morning to do that and uh i've also tried to set aside time in the afternoon or evening
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh things generally pop up that precru preclude me from from doing that so i just need to get into a habit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah there's a a program on in the afternoons on channel two at four o'clock do you have a VCR
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh yes i do
 	
 	
 		uh you might record it and play it later now it's just uh
 		oh stretch and tone it's not aerobics
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		uh but it's called body electric and it's a a lady broadcasting from Florida and uh it's for thirty minutes it comes on uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		five days a week and uh it it it's a really good supplement to your bike riding
 	
 	
 		well great
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh it helps with flexibility and uh
 		for uh for some of the exercises she uses three pound weights
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but uh she's not a a a great weight person but uh sometimes for the uh upper arms and deltoids and
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		uh back muscles she uses these three pound weights
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's that's good that's one thing that i'd
 		and the weights i'd kind of like to get away from because in high school and college i lifted an awful lot of weights and that immediately
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
