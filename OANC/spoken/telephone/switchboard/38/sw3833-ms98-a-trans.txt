 
     		
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh do you work outside the home
 	
 	
 		um i did until my company went bankrupt
 	
 	
 		oh poor baby
 	
 	
 		yeah now right now i haven't been able to locate a job down here in Patterson
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's kind of a small
 		city so
 		i've been going to Modesto which is larger but it's not like being in the Bay area where i came from
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but anyhow when i did work in the winter time i wore uh my wool skirts and sweaters and boots
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because the Bay area gets kind of chilly in the winter time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and um then in the summer time i just wore you know the polyester blouses and usually usually pants and just uh heels you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh where do you work at
 	
 	
 		i work for a bank and uh i have to dress somewhat more formally
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i i look like the little old lady preppie
 	
 	
 		you  do you i don't suppose you can wear pants
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh no i i guess i could but i don't
 	
 	
 		oh because i never see anybody in the banks out here it seems like i never see them with pants on
 	
 	
 		no no we don't wear pants uh i i wear suits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh almost exclusively
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		have you ever had a uh a color analysis
 	
 	
 		no no i haven't
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well it's a very interesting process
 		uh according to the lady that did mine she called them summer and winter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh spring and fall and the summer she said you could call them A B C D or one two three four or whatever
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but there are people that look better in the cool colors
 		than than the other people look better in the earth and warm colors
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh most people are summers or winters
 		and uh
 		uh it's really an interesting process and i found out i was a summer so i look much better in the the blues pinks
 		uh
 		the the winters uh wear stronger colors
 		but basically the same types of colors but as a summer i'm not supposed to wear uh black or stark white
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		the winters just winters wear black and white and the summer uh the spring and and fall colors wear well i have a daughter in law that uh
 		uh this the the camouflage colors the khakis and olive drab green
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just make her eyes light up like crazy yeah and then i i also have a daughter in law who has auburn hair
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		isn't that
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so  she wears the earth colors uh the oranges and the olive drab greens and the khakis and and uh they're most becoming to her so it it it really is an interesting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hum
 	
 	
 		analysis
 	
 	
 		yeah that would be interesting to do um i worked for a trucking company so we didn't really even have to dress up at all if we didn't want to we could wear pants all the time you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i just in the winter time i just like to wear boots and you know the wool skirts and the sweaters and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh  i've never gone to and had a you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		anything like that done to tell me exactly what color i would look best in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i know i don't look good in yellow but i like pink and blue you know and red
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i just look in the mirror and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well reds uh i i have to have a red that leans towards the the blue uh in other words it leans toward the maroon
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but the reds that lead lean toward the orange don't do a thing for me
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i have to be careful about reds
 	
 	
 		uh-huh huh very interesting
 		so do you have your do you like do you in Dallas do you wear wool in the winter time or
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah uh we have thirty nine an average of thirty nine days when it gets down below freezing and as a general rule at least oh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh two or three days at a time during the winter we'll either have uh ice covered streets or two or three inches of snow
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so uh i i wear woolens quite a bit
 	
 	
 		um-hum and naturally it gets real hot in the summertime i suppose yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah oh yeah it gets very warm in the summertime
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it gets hot here in Patterson in the summer time more so than it did in the Bay area you know um like here
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh-huh
 		are are you over toward Fresno
 	
 	
 		uh like um a hundred and twenty six miles from Fresno

 		but in the valley north
