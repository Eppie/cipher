 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so Cathy what do you do in the way of lawn and garden work
 	
 	
 		well we have Bermuda grass here do you have that there
 	
 	
 		um i don't know exactly what that is
 	
 	
 		it's a kind of grass that dies in the winter time
 	
 	
 		um i don't
 	
 	
 		do you live in an apartment or a house
 	
 	
 		yeah i live in an apartment
 	
 	
 		so you probably don't do any lawn care
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's actually correct
 	
 	
 		oh okay well we used to have a service come in
 		and fertilize and such but we ran in some into some money trouble so we do all of that ourselves now does the grass die there in Iowa in the winter time
 		is everything brown
 	
 	
 		um it turns brown yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		guess it freezes and everything so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so right now we do nothing because it's brown and it doesn't grow until
 		later on in the spring
 	
 	
 		so does that mean you have to replant each year or
 	
 	
 		but
 		no huh-uh it just goes dormant and then it starts it's you know it rejuvenates itself in the springtime there are people that uh
 		that reseed in the winter time and grow something called winter grass or something like that i can't remember exactly what it's called
 		and so it's green in the winter but you have to seed over all of this other stuff that's
 		there and it's kind of hard to grow it's kind of foolish  as far as i'm concerned
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		so did you grow up in Iowa
 	
 	
 		no i'm actually from uh
 		uh the Seattle area we lived outside  outside of the city in the country and uh we have five acres of land up against a hillside where i grew up and so we did have a garden about a one a half acre garden big size
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and grew standard things like corn beans and we had some trees apple trees fruit trees you know and apple trees and
 	
 	
 		did your mom do any canning and that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		did lots of canning and
 		we even
 		made an annual trip out to eastern Washington
 		Yakima area to get uh
 		peaches and things like that to can in addition to the the fruit we got out of our own garden
 	
 	
 		huh
 		huh
 		we have a garden here but in Texas it's really hard to grow a garden because it's so
 		hot  and the sun is so intense that you know the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the tomatoes come on and they kind of fry right on the plant so it's real hard and the bugs you know if that doesn't kill it the bugs do so i have tried kind you know with just very little success
 		to have a garden here
 		did you enjoy it did you like to do it when you were there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i enjoyed um
 		working in the garden
 		um
 		my dad was a big um
 		fan of organic gardening
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and so when we um did our garbage and stuff we separated all the banana peels and egg shells and stuff that
 	
 	
 		yeah you had a compost pile huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and
 		always picked a different place in the garden to dump it out
 		had our own rototiller and
 		rough even though it was a large plot we used a rototiller for the whole thing and so that was it was quite a bit of work for all of us but we five kids and
 	
 	
 		how many how many were in your family
 	
 	
 		uh
 		six kids altogether
 	
 	
 		was it something that the kids mostly took care of
 	
 	
 		actually dad did more than his share but uh we always had our our assignments to help out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so and mom did very little of the gardening although she did most of the canning and other things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		what was your favorite thing
 		to eat
 	
 	
 		um oh to eat oh um
 		the our big crops were were
 		green beans and corn and i guess i liked the corn
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so  now that i'm in Iowa i should be get be able to get lots of uh
 	
 	
 		you'd think so
 	
 	
 		corn on the cob huh
 	
 	
 		so what took you to Iowa
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i just graduated
 		i
 		i'm working at the University of Iowa
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um on a post doctoral fellowship i just graduated
 		out west with a PhD in physics
 	
 	
 		where did you graduate
 	
 	
 		uh Brigham Young University
 	
 	
 		i knew it  i'm a member too that's why i was  when you were talking about your garden and everything and your mom canning i thought this guy's got to be  got to have roots there somewhere
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh
 		
 
 		yes and uh
 		so are you originally from Texas
 	
 	
 		no i grew up in California
 	
 	
 		i see
 		did did your family have a farm or were you more in the city
 	
 	
 		no it was more in the city but we did have a um a little garden out in the back because anything grows there  you just stick it in the ground and it it grows
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		yeah my wife is from southern California and their family has a an orange tree and a lemon tree out back
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they grow a few things they tried tomatoes and stuff but not they don't have very you know just a small small backyard so there's not too much else they could do there
 	
 	
 		yeah do you have in in your apartment
