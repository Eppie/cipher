 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i assume most of the books you're reading these days since you're a student have to do with studies
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's about all i get a chance for between that and um uh Bible study as often as i can that's about the bulk of it
 	
 	
 		the uh
 	
 	
 		not a whole lot of chances otherwise
 	
 	
 		what year are you in in computer science
 	
 	
 		okay um officially a junior right now um
 	
 	
 		yeah and so the course work you're doing is what
 	
 	
 		well right now i'm taking a a uh my fourth semester of of electronics dealing mostly with uh uh MOSFET and JFET transistors
 	
 	
 		i thought you said computer science was your major
 	
 	
 		and
 		well okay they they're  are gonna uh computer engineering
 	
 	
 		oh computer engineering okay that's yeah okay
 	
 	
 		okay i am getting some programming right right now i'm taking my first semester in in
 	
 	
 		well
 		no no i actually i'm an engineer by training and uh i it is my impression that's easier for an engineer to learn about computers than it is for a computer science person to learn about computers
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well with this well they classify it as computer engineering technology so i'm getting a fair amount of programming as well as electronics
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		right so who's books do you use for programming
 	
 	
 		uh it depends on which language they're working with um
 	
 	
 		well tell me what language we're taking these days
 	
 	
 		right now i'm taking C i've got three semesters in Pascal behind me
 	
 	
 		taking C okay is that just standard C or C plus plus
 	
 	
 		uh that we're working with what what they called standard uh ANSI C
 	
 	
 		yes right um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i'm not real sure what the difference is gonna be between C and C
 	
 	
 		well C plus plus is object oriented and there is uh quite a bit of difference and it quite often has you need a book up front to tell you about uh precompiling and that sort of thing and then it normally does a little shuffle up front
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then runs on ANSI C or some other similar dialect of C so it does uh some preprocessing to begin with who's book do you use in Pascal
 	
 	
 		okay well what we're working with is
 		uh i don't remember the author's name
 	
 	
 		well how we going to talk about books  well maybe we better switch to pleasure then uh what do you read for pleasure
 	
 	
 		
 
 		used to be i read a good deal of uh science fiction
 	
 	
 		so Isaac Asimov for example
 	
 	
 		um Asimov um Clark uh
 	
 	
 		yeah Arthur Clark
 	
 	
 		there's uh
 		the big one was Asimov his he's his stuff was easiest to find
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		what got me started in the first place was uh my brother-in-law gave me a set the uh um Foundation Trilogy
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's fantastic
 	
 	
 		back junior a year and a when i was a in in junior high school he gave it to me
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's hard to put down those
 	
 	
 		oh yeah and he's come up with what  three more books
 	
 	
 		have you ever read Asimov's I Robot
 	
 	
 		uh parts of it i got three parts of it
 	
 	
 		i tell you that that is hilarious some parts of that you know the the one i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah wait a minute matter of fact i did read i i Robot
 	
 	
 		i have actually gone back and is is long enough that was the first science fiction book i ever read was I Robot
 	
 	
 		I Robot yeah that's pretty light reading for science fiction those kind of things
 	
 	
 		and it
 		and it was so good i went back and read it again because Asimov knows how to string things together you know
 	
 	
 		yes he does well the uh Foundation Trilogy is directly connected to I Robot
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah right
 	
 	
 		as a matter of fact his last book Foundation and Earth
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		they made the finally made the connection
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that uh
 		um leader robot whatever his i don't remember his name now
 	
 	
 		i can't remember the name either but
 	
 	
 		anyway he's still going in the Foundation at the uh in Foundation and Earth they meet up with him
 	
 	
 		uh
 		huh
 		i'll be darned
 	
 	
 		he's on a base on the moon and somehow or another earth has been so utterly polluted with uh uh uh radioactive fallout that it's utterly inhabitable uninhabitable even though it's been several million years
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh several hundred thousand years anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's it's  utterly uninhabitable
 	
 	
 		well while i was working i got enough i read on the job a lot of course just like a student does because you're learning all the time in research so i read
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		started uh long enough ago that uh vacuum tubes were still in business when i was a young engineer you know  so i had to continually upgrade my education and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that was really good for me because that's what i'd like to do anyway i'd like to be a permanent student you know so uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah well i i got started on student  late
 		i was thirty three when i started to college for the first time
 	
 	
 		yeah so you knew what you wanted to do yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah i'd i'd been an auto mechanic for twenty years
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		started about twelve years old for my father but uh decided you know i i had a pretty good idea that wasn't what i wanted to do any more
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		have you been in the military at all
 	
 	
 		no didn't go through military um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		so probably so probably the things that i enjoy reading relative to military you would enjoy The Web Web Griffin stuff uh which uh has to do with the military and other right wing things
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh not familiar with it
