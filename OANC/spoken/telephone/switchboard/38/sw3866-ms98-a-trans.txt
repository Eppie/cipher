 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh i mean i guess i get it most people i get it from uh the paper and the TV and
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i guess probably now the TV first the paper second and radio third
 	
 	
 		yeah same here
 		uh i hardly ever listen to news on the radio i don't even know if they have it anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah i was just kind of think of the order you know but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah what do you think about uh you know the second part of that question was are they doing a good job
 		i'm beginning to think you know especially this week with all that stuff coming out about Clinton uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think it's uh i don't know i mean
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's getting a little bit ridiculous i mean this this i don't know if you saw it yesterday but uh
 		where i was at had it on CNN and uh they had that press conference with that uh Jennifer Flowers uh Clinton's alleged uh mistress whatever and uh
 		it just got to be so i mean it's ridiculous because you know one of the questions was uh do did uh Clinton use a condom and all that i mean it was uh uh the whole press corp was just laughing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i got a feeling that
 		you know cause from from what you know i got most of my information from the Larry King show and uh
 		it was like nobody's verified her story at all and it just came from the tabloids and everybody jumped on to it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		without and nobody's been able to verify that she's telling the truth all the only thing they know is that she lied about everything else
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i mean he probably did it i mean that's my belief i just think that you know if he did it  you know he should have said so on Sixty Minutes and cause i mean American public is pretty forgiving and
 		most times yeah if you do something i mean what else can you say how can you
 	
 	
 		would you go on national television and and uh tell the world that you'd had an affair and you know and your wife and her parents are listening and
 	
 	
 		well now with
 	
 	
 		that would be kind of rough to do
 	
 	
 		yeah but i mean the fact is now that he's left himself the fact that he wouldn't deny it or
 		confirm it was he's just left himself open to further digging from other reporters now you know there's all types of rumors now that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Miss uh America Miss Arkansas all the way down to Miss Teen Arkansas well allegedly had a
 		thing with him i mean it's just going to keep dogging him i i think he's going to be out of the race in two weeks just because this is going to keep getting the fact that he won't confirm or deny i mean
 		i mean he he's this has been going on for years though i mean he's always had rumors and stuff and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i thought we were kind of through with this a few years ago when Gary Hart uh got caught messing around and
 		i thought we would kind of leave private lives out of this the politics but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah and he
 		no it's just i know it's just i think  is just the fact that he uh
 		he just flat out lied to the public that he didn't and it was totally proven wrong and then he challenged you know the press to you know prove it and they did and that's what killed him and Clinton on the other hand if he if he
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we're waiting
 	
 	
 		i mean he took a big risk just even going on TV the other night with his wife but i think his wife came off better than he did but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		in the end i think he's just going to his people now are you know the
 		the fund the campaign you know they're going to wait and see what happens and you know when he keeps more stuff more stuff keeps coming out about him and then
 		i think he'll be out uh you know he'll be out of the race eventually because the money is what uh  the only thing that matters in the end and if he doesn't have any money there's not
 	
 	
 		yeah well when i heard i guess it was yesterday i heard that she'd gotten in excess over a hundred thousand dollars to talk to the this tabloid thing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah she she's a bimbo i mean you know
 	
 	
 		i thought well golly gee she's got to be lying i'd say i slept with him for a hundred thousand bucks you know
 		maybe  but
 	
 	
 		the
 		
 
 		yeah but
 		i don't know i mean it's just the press is always going to be like that i think and you know i mean Americans most i think that most people in America know
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i mean my people my age you know probably probably really don't care i mean what they i really don't you know care what they do as long as it doesn't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		why has the press gone overboard in telling us things and
 	
 	
 		but when the press says that you know some it's it's important it's got to be important because i mean they control
 		i mean
 		what's said and everything
 		yeah i think it's i mean yeah i think it's totally gone overboard and i mean it's  issues and everything and the timing of this can
 		can be more worse for him but he he's clearly the front runner now he's about to get blown out of the water at this time
 	
 	
 		well if if if if somehow he clears himself from this he is all of a sudden jumped out in front
 		because everybody knows his name and and knows where he's from and knows what he looks like and i'm not sure everybody knows all the other people at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh i mean he he he had i mean he had the thing won but now i mean
 	
 	
 		that are
 	
 	
 		i i just don't think he'll be around i mean this this if you go by past history and you know he's he's dodging the subject now you know he says
 		he clearly stated you know what he had to say on Sixty Minutes he didn't say anything all he said was that the American public knows that i'm mean you know
 		okay what what do you mean uh Bill and you know i'm not going to confirm or deny anything i mean that's where you
