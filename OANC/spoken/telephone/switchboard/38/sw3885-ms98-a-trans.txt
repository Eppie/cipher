 
     		
 	
 		declined that
 		San Francisco has more crime than Texas
 	
 	
 		than Plano Texas yeah i sure am
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's a it's a difficult question i don't know that i uh can easily come up with an answer to what can be done
 	
 	
 		i don't think there is an answer of what would make crime go away there's no such thing
 	
 	
 		i think probably drugs have a lot to do with crime in our society today so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think you're right
 		have you ever had your house broken into
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		i haven't either
 	
 	
 		it's it's hard to know actually whether the
 		crime um impact would
 		be better or would would decrease or would increase if there were some changes in the way drugs are legislated i don't know if
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have uh an opinion yet about uh legalization of certain kinds of drugs but
 		uh-huh boy there's certainly a lot connected with that you know
 	
 	
 		that's for sure
 	
 	
 		organized crime as well as
 	
 	
 		that's for sure
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i've never really been a victim of a crime and i've never had my car stolen or my house broken into or
 		any of that so
 	
 	
 		well i guess
 	
 	
 		i've always lived in suburbs i don't know if that has anything to do with it or not but
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i grew up in a pretty small town and i'm not sure that um
 		the size of the community or the general appearances safety really has as much to do with it because because you're seen as an enclave You might get hit by somebody from the outside anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i guess on a on a local level uh i i was thinking when i heard the question about major changes in the country today but it's probably a little easier now that i think about it if i look at what an individual could do and obviously
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if you have lights on and you have uh uh a timing system for your lights in your own home you're going to reduce the risk of being broken into
 	
 	
 		right there's so many things that you can do in that way and you know going into parking lots with
 		with your keys out being prepared you know being on the defensive
 	
 	
 		right right looking less like a victim
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		neighborhoods watching each other
 	
 	
 		yeah we have a neighborhood crime watch where i am where did you grow up
 	
 	
 		yes
 		in a southern California suburb It was outside of Long Beach kind of near Huntington Beach
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well my girls and i were just just down there this Christmas they play soccer and so we were down in that same area
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've lived in San Francisco for about thirteen years now and um probably have learned by
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		uh indirect and direct experiences about things to do to you know avoid those kind of situations but i think part of it's just as you grow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as you mature you you recognize um how to present yourself in a public situation so that you don't look like you are a victim a potential victim
 	
 	
 		that's right yep
 	
 	
 		it's a hard thing to communicate to kids isn't it
 	
 	
 		it sure is do you have children
 	
 	
 		i have a two year old
 	
 	
 		yeah they're not afraid of much at two
 	
 	
 		no no but you know as a child we were able to uh ride our bikes around the neighborhood and go to our friends and those are things that i'm not sure i'd be comfortable with when she gets to bike riding age you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yep i can understand that you know as we were traveling back from that same toc soccer tournament i was telling you about we stopped in Mesa Arizona
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i was just amazed at the freedom that those kids felt they just don't have i mean even here in Plano Texas i worry when my kids
 		walk you know a block
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we talked to some of our relatives there and they said you know we just don't worry about that there aren't kidnappings and there aren't
 		there isn't that element here yet
 	
 	
 		that's interesting how large a community is that
 	
 	
 		um i don't really know  it's not real big it's right outside of Tucson
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and and Plano what would you say is the population
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know that either
 		it's
 	
 	
 		because sometimes it's hard to you know i i look at small towns that have had problems with kidnappings and i think
 		well the you know they're not on the edge of some large metropolis Um you know it's hard to even
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		look at the factors that influence that happening why why in that particular you know
 	
 	
 		why it would happen here and not there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yep
 		i guess you just have to kind of look for a family environment and and neighborhood and hope for the best you know and just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you find yourself teaching your children things that uh you you know that they need to do but you didn't have perhaps in the way of level of awareness at an early age
 	
 	
 		sure
 		sure it and it's so frightening because you have to teach them to be scared all the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh-huh how how do they respond to that when you tell them about kidnappings at what age were they ready for that
 	
 	
 		and to really be cautious
 		
 
 		well they don't know any other way they don't know any other way i mean they weren't raised when i was when you didn't worry about that everyone worries about that now so they just assume that you'll always have to be on your guard
 	
 	
 		uh-huh how old were were they when you introduced that subject
 	
 	
 		and this
 		oh real young i mean i can remember when my my oldest daughter is thirteen today
 		and when she was just three i took her to the Sun Valley Mall do you know where that is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i grew up there in Concord
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		anyway and um she had gotten lost
 		and it started right then
 		you know and every person i would see that had a little girl you know tucked under their arm i'd run you know
 	
 	
 		oh gosh a scary experience
 	
 	
 		to see if that was her
 		oh yeah
