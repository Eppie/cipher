 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh creates some conversation anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so what do you think do you think they're honest or they in for it themselves or
 	
 	
 		oh no i i think uh i think they're honest i i you know there are some exceptions i think for the majority of them are honest and uh i just think in uh especially in the federal government the thing has just become bigger than
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		both of us all of us and it's just too big to handle and uh i think they look uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they look a lot fairly incompetent at times and and i just think it's
 		i think they mean well they have good intentions and i as you know as far as the topic goes we as far as i'm concerned they're basically honest people but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well i was thinking if they were in for their for their own personal gain they're probably
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they what was that your other line or
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know what that go ahead go
 	
 	
 		yeah but they'd probably you know they'd stay in for ten or twelve years maybe but then get out and use those contacts they made and go work as a consultant for some of these private industries that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		let me get this other thing here hold on a second
 	
 	
 		okay
 		sure thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hello
 	
 	
 		it's still me
 	
 	
 		okay i don't know what that was
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh no i just think the
 		the uh federal government especially is just so huge i mean problems are so big and uh it's so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		internationalized that uh i don't know it just i don't know what the solution is but uh i don't think they're in it for their own personal gain uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah there's actually you know you think you know they get paid what a hundred and hundred and twenty five thousand that's really not all that much compared to
 	
 	
 		right
 		well
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		considering that they have to live up there i mean the living conditions up there i mean not the conditions but the private cost of living is atrocious and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't think a lot of them are making uh netting a whole lot of money once they leave up there
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		oh and i think a lot of them go in with a you know pretty idealist approach that you know they can make some changes and stuff  but i think they get in they all of a sudden find out what the real life is  and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right and they're just one of uh five hundred and thirty five and you're just talking about the Congress and the House of Representatives and the Senate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly
 		well you look at even the President you know he's got to fight against all you know the other five hundred thirty five to get anything through anyway so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think anytime you've got a a Republican administration and a uh oh a so-so senate as far as uh the split between the Democrats and the Republicans and then the democratic uh House uh whoever's in power
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		is going to have their hands full and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it doesn't
 		it's not really conducive to getting a lot done it sure seems like
 	
 	
 		no but uh it's too bad uh but i think it's like a lot of things whether it's a company or an organization of some kind or the goverment federal government it's uh it gets to be too big and uh it controls uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you don't have the proper controls in place well then it's going to get out of hand and people are going to look silly kind of foolish foolish and silly when they're uh trying to operate that thing
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		yeah and like you say it's
 		you know the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing and the do you know even mouth sometimes are doing going the opposite direction so
 	
 	
 		right
 		i know our state government gets a lot of heck as well down here and uh i don't know about of course about states i don't pay a whole lot of attention to the state government uh we've got a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a female governor and she ran against a real clown here a year or so ago and both of them neither there just wasn't a whole lot to pick from
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well there was that was a lot of that was public quite uh a public thing i mean we heard a lot about it on national news news that was that Richards wasn't that her name
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		right
 		uh Richards uh Ann Richards is the governor she won then Clayton Williams was the guy that ran against her and he was a west Texas uh rancher and so forth
 	
 	
 		gal that won
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh they were both a
 		couple of clowns
 	
 	
 		seemed like there was more personal mud mud throwing than anything else if i if i remember the news reports and stuff but
 	
 	
 		well they
 		they had a good time it was serious business but i think they enjoyed themselves and a lot of people down here just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so are they doing any good is she doing any good or
 	
 	
 		oh
 		not really she i think uh they she's been in office just about a year now and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as far as her public uh public opinion surveys i think they give her about a fifty fifty rating she she hasn't uh destroyed the place but the economy down here is in pretty bad shape and she can't do much about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh she's she's done okay that who's to say how he would have done he he's a business man he's been successful i i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if i had voted i would have voted for him but  she's done all right
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah did we just uh we got our first woman mayor up here in Salt Lake uh just this past election and uh you know they made a big deal of that but she's a business woman and that's what she was really pushing was
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		business mindedness in uh you know in government and stuff and some of those in same business philosophies and it will be interesting to see how she does because
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know she's kind of a self-made i don't know if she's a millionaire but she you know got her own businesses and stuff but that was her big thing that she was pushing so
 	
 	
 		um
 		uh-huh
 		she a Republican
 	
 	
 		uh no she's Democrat
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		which uh
 	
 	
 		well you
 	
 	
 		actually Salt Lake and the county around Salt Lake is quite a bit Democrat so it's not really surprising we've had a a a Democratic mayor for quite a few years
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the state as a whole is probably more definitely more Republican but
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah it will be a lot it will be interesting to see how she does the you know there's
 		she's already stepped on a few toes i think she's making the changes but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well she's going to have to do
