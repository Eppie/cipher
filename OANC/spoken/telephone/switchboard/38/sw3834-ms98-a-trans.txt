 		uh-huh
 		well uh
 	
 	
 		you ready i i'll hit it if you're ready to start okay
 	
 	
 		oh i'm ready yeah sure
 	
 	
 		my name's Karen by the way what what's your name
 	
 	
 		Karen my name's John Benyak where do you live
 	
 	
 		San Francisco
 	
 	
 		oh i live in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh nice to meet you
 	
 	
 		just outside of Dallas
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		nice talking to you
 		what's that mean we're ready to go
 	
 	
 		ready to go
 	
 	
 		okay well it uh the way it turned out it wasn't worth anything really i just don't think i've always thought that uh
 		it just wasn't carried on the way it should have been it wasn't carried on like a war i mean if we were in there to fight a war regardless of the reason we were there it should have been fought like a war it just uh
 	
 	
 		what would that how would that have been different if it had been fought like a war
 	
 	
 		we
 		well i think we'd uh we'd uh beat them i don't think uh
 		i don't know what would have happened twenty years later down the road with the country within and with us but uh i think if we'd uh had allowed the military people to conduct it like a war
 		instead of letting the politicians and the
 		and the peace  and people like that dictate the terms of the way we fought i think things would have turned out a lot differently
 	
 	
 		you you think it was a winnable war then
 	
 	
 		oh yes yeah i mean it was just a two bit country always was and always will be and uh or at least it is now and there's no way
 		that if we'd uh been able to take uh
 		use the capacity that we had the potential we had to fight a war against a country like that we would have uh what would have lost it as a war the long term effects well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know that's that's a little tougher to answer i think uh
 		depends i guess on who's in office but uh i think Bush used that uh last year in the Persian Gulf uh by taking some stronger stronger measures and when the war started
 	
 	
 		you mean the effects of of Vietnam being to encourage him to to be more defensive in his posture and go for
 	
 	
 		be more or be more offensive well once the war started once they decided
 	
 	
 		i meant offensive i'm sorry uh-huh
 	
 	
 		once they decided to fight the thing we take a take a much uh
 		run in there and do it as quickly as possible rather than let the thing drag on i guess what happened back in Vietnam is that uh they we escalated and uh just you know on a gradual basis and gave the
 		North Vietnamese and Viet Cong time to adjust to our uh
 		increases in uh personnel and so forth they just didn't go in there if they'd a sent five hundred thousand troops in there at one time initially uh i think things would have been would have been differently but different but it they went from
 		having the advisors uh up to that four hundred to five hundred thousand troops over a period of time a long a long number of years and as i said i think the uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the enemy just gradually adjusted to that
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and they didn't uh the people the country the people here didn't want the war the way it turned out they didn't want it
 	
 	
 		i do think one of the effects was that the uh people involved in that kind of an um activity were surprised at the power that the media had on um intervening and probably
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		set the tone for medias involved then in future whether it was a war activity or
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		something along those lines that are going to involve a number of people
 	
 	
 		really
 		right well there are
 	
 	
 		everything changed after that in terms of media
 	
 	
 		well there were every every night you'd come home from work and uh or school or whatever and see it on the uh the news i
 		imagine that wasn't the case during World War Two or any of the other wars uh people just didn't feel like they had the involvement in it and there were a lot of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a lot of
 	
 	
 		well you remember in the Gulf War they made a specific effort not to repeat the mistakes that the media they felt the media made in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Vietnam war they weren't about to have people in there reporting
 	
 	
 		right
 		right yeah but uh i just uh
 		i i guess i was in my let's see
 		my twenties during during most of that war and i i never did think that they were were doing it right i'm just not a uh a fan of Jane Fonda and people like her i mean that she'd go around speaking on different campuses and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		getting people uh aroused about the whole thing and of course uh they always talked about the vocal minority and i guess that's what it was the solid majority and the vocal minority
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		people were listening to to her and i guess politicians were too but i just felt
 		i was in the service at that time i wasn't over there but i just felt that they fought the thing i mean they just didn't fight it like they should have and it's a war whether a war is right or wrong you i mean if you're over there and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		people or young people men or women are dying they ought to fight it as a war and
 		either win or lose based on the fact that it's a war and not just uh uh mealy mouth their their way through the thing and try to get the other side to give up on the basis of what they thought we had in terms of power and so forth
 	
 	
 		that approach probably would have shortened the time that we were over there too at least
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it would sure shorten the time and reduce the number of casualties and so forth we might have lost i i i just don't think we could have lost
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
