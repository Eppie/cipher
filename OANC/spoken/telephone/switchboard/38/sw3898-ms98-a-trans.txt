 
     		
 	
 		okay Gene so it's nice to talk with you and um food is a very intriguing thing our lives are are built around foods that we like and and nutritionally good for us what kind of dining out do you like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes sir
 		well there is two kinds one i guess i'd say is with my wife where we enjoy uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		oh i guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant uh you know something nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the other is with my whole family whom we uh go somewhere that the kids will enjoy
 		uh recently we've been hitting Pancho's up it's a local Mexican restaurant pretty heavily because they've got a good rate on the you know good prices and everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		Pancho that's a new one um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's it's a chain down here uh it goes up into Colorado and down here i don't know where else it is what about you
 	
 	
 		we had one called Chi-Chi's in this in our area
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we had a restaurant called La Bamba but it's just it closed recently but Chi-Chi's is a national restaurant i think isn't it Mexican do you have it there
 	
 	
 		i think think it might be i've seen i think i've seen it around yes sir yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i love Mexican food myself
 	
 	
 		oh do you yeah
 	
 	
 		but you go ahead now
 	
 	
 		oh we we do too we uh we enjoy Mexican food i'm just not impressed with the quality of it it's just primarily the price that's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		satisfying at this point but the kids seem to enjoy it
 	
 	
 		is that right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh let's see we've uh just recently discovered a super restaurant down here but it's uh
 		not part of a chain it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant but the first one we've been to that
 		uh i don't think there was anything on the menu that that any of us had that was uh not just really super it's nice to find a place like that
 	
 	
 		oh boy that is wonderful well i i agree with you on that and i was was really a seafood addict myself i i love crab meat in particular
 	
 	
 		you know yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		i uh i can almost live on on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if  had to
 	
 	
 		oh boy have you ever been to uh what is it Original Book Binders in Philadelphia
 	
 	
 		i know the name but i haven't been there
 	
 	
 		uh that's an old established uh restaurant i used to go there when i was in college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh where did you go to college
 	
 	
 		i went to the Naval Academy and we used to we used to go up there on uh for football games sometimes
 	
 	
 		oh  the Naval Academy
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and have some liberty and yeah we'd go over there to uh  pretty sure it was original Original Book Binders i think it was yes
 	
 	
 		i'll be darn
 	
 	
 		i haven't been back there in years
 	
 	
 		well we're we're supposed to be talking about dining out but i'll just make one comment that uh i just retired from Penn State
 		and uh all my work has been in research for the Navy
 	
 	
 		okay what area
 	
 	
 		
 
 		underwater acoustics
 	
 	
 		is that right did you have any dealings with the uh underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando Florida
 	
 	
 		i have dealt with nearly all of the all of the research laboratories that the country has
 	
 	
 		yes sir my dad worked there for years and years that's where that's uh that's where i grew up was down in Orlando so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh you grew up in Orlando uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's uh that's interesting well i was in submarines uh
 	
 	
 		well that's what i worked on
 	
 	
 		okay yeah must have had some interesting uh assignments for you there when when did you retire
 	
 	
 		uh end of last month
 	
 	
 		well great i'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics
 	
 	
 		i certainly have
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so what i hate to uh i wish i could talk to you about that uh but uh i guess we should continue on uh
 	
 	
 		okay right first
 	
 	
 		okay how do you like Chinese food
 	
 	
 		oh we we do enjoy that yes sir uh i don't know if we're particularly adventurous we find something we like uh like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good uh
 		at a particular restaurant and then we usually stick by it but do you what about you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i uh enjoy the Szechuan type of uh Chinese food
 	
 	
 		hot um-hum
 	
 	
 		yes yep um it's it's i i do a lot of Chinese cooking myself i have in the past i haven't done it recently but uh it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals
 	
 	
 		um where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking
 	
 	
 		um just at home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i enjoyed the food and i bought a lot of uh
 		good cookbooks and i've been following through on that when you find the right cookbook why it works out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food
 	
 	
 		okay well that one's a good question here it's right under my nose if i can find it
 		
 
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		i guess one of the things we've uh started avoiding is the uh run of the mill chop suey and things like that but we enjoy trying uh different kinds of chicken or uh seafood you know even uh shrimp uh
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant
 	
 	
 		one of the the this book i have is called Chinese Cooking Made Easy
 		um
 		it's a paperback and i think it's by someone named Chang yeah Isabelle Chang
 	
 	
 		okay thanks for that uh reference
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think'll enjoy that
 	
 	
 		okay good yeah
 	
 	
 		well it certainly is nice talking with you Gene and uh what is your phone number at home
