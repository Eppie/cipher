 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right uh yeah not as much as i used to be i i grew up in Pittsburgh and
 	
 	
 		you say you a Steeler fan
 		so did i no kidding
 	
 	
 		did you yeah i left there i went to school out that way that about forty miles east of Pittsburgh and then uh
 		i left in the mid sixties and right after i left well a few years later they started having some good teams
 	
 	
 		yeah Chuck Knoll as a matter of fact uh did the coin flip in uh yesterday's Super Bowl
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah he's looking good he's sixty i think and he just you know
 	
 	
 		he looks real good he certainly had a an unfortunate uh end to a brilliant career
 	
 	
 		yeah for considering
 		yeah they just uh i don't know what happened they just weren't getting any draft picks and weren't i guess they just weren't picking the right guy weren't right people
 	
 	
 		well that's what i think i think the the the sad thing about the Steelers is that they stuck with the crew a little too long and i think that's the the biggest problem for dynasties is that you just really have to cycle people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		yeah they uh he was loyal to a lot of those guys that
 		helped uh helped him win those Super Bowls in the seventies and uh stuck with him too long and then i think the
 		the draft uh picks did fall on hard times and they just never were able to get back to where they were
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh uh we've lived here in Dallas for about nineteen years and i've never become a Cowboys fan in fact i don't i just don't like them at all but
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		how about Houston uh Oilers any more appealing to you
 	
 	
 		oh i like them better than the Cowboys i don't i just uh
 		other than the Steelers i don't have a real a real favorite uh like the Eagles i like the Redskins but uh usually like the teams that the Cowboys are playing for the most part you're a Forty Niner fan
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i had you know i was a Steeler fan and a Forty Niner fan um they've certainly built themselves a you know a great team as a matter of fact if they hadn't lost so many games early in the season i think they might have been a contender might have given Washington a game
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 		yeah yeah they had
 	
 	
 		but uh they lost uh so many games early that they that their comeback made little difference at the end
 	
 	
 		yeah they weren't the same without Montana
 	
 	
 		well Montana made a difference but as the analysts analysts have said over and over again the game is won and lost at the line of scrimmage a smart quarterback makes a big difference and i really think for example yesterday
 		Buffalo might very well have been in it until the end had Kelley been uh a smarter quarterback i i frankly am surprised that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um Marv Levy would allow him to call all those plays
 	
 	
 		oh was he calling the plays i didn't even
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think that's just too tough in a on a uh uh you know a guy i mean you got to be real real savvy to do that and i don't see Kelley as being that savvy i don't i think that's one of the weaknesses in the Buffalo offense myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah he had a
 	
 	
 		because they certainly have a heck of a defense although it was picked apart a little bit i mean Washington just looked phenomenal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right yeah well couple of those passes a couple of those receivers for Buffalo dropped some important uh passes too they it would have made might have made a little bit of a difference not much but uh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't i i just looked in the paper this this evening and trying to figure out when the last time the AFC won a game guess it was eighty four Raiders
 	
 	
 		it it's it's nine years ago
 	
 	
 		Raiders beat uh the Redskins i think as a matter of fact but boy it's
 	
 	
 		yeah it's been been a while
 	
 	
 		i was thinking maybe they uh ought to just AFC ought to just give it up and uh when uh it comes time for the Super Bowl the NFC champ plays an all star team of the AFC teams that might be a little more interesting because i'm getting a little tired of watching the blowouts in the uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well it is it is a little disappointing and there's some it it's very interesting to see you know what's what's behind this is it is it the uh i mean you would think theoretically that the draft picks would uh
 		you know random and then free agency also makes a big difference
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i don't understand it i mean they just uh they they Denver you know went a few times and they didn't do anything uh Cincinnati they didn't do anything now uh Buffalo
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah well
 		Buffalo twice well they did get close last year they could have won last Buffalo could have won last year against the Giants
 		but uh just seems like there's a big gap in talent between the or maybe in coaching between the AFC and the NFC because it's like i said it's been nine years or eight years since they uh since AFCs won a game
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh i guess they're gonna somebody was saying uh somebody i was watching the game with some people they were saying that instant replay may be on its way out i guess they have enough votes to uh or not enough votes to keep it going
 	
 	
 		well you know i think that's sad in a way because i think if you look for example there were a couple of calls yesterday that were appallingly bad
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i just it's it's it's shameful and and i think that that once Pandora's out of the box you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't know i i i i think it can complicate things i recognize that but i sure think it's it's reversed some some calls that were bad calls although yesterday it didn't reverse one that was a very bad call what
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well
 		um yeah i just don't like it it it delays the game it delays uh i don't know it it just kind of interrupts interrupts the flow of things and uh i
 	
 	
 		well there yeah there is that problem and and but uh i guess that  that the real the real interesting thing is in the age of television you're going to get so much analysis of it that a that a game really for example yesterday when when Andre Reid
 	
 	
 		um-hum
