 		well uh sort of mixed feelings about it i guess uh uh i i side i lean more towards the control side than than towards
 		you know just the the free free arming um on the other hand i it's it's sort of an issue of of uh
 		uh i'm not i'm not a great fan of of government control in general and so it's it's kind of a tough issue what about yourself
 	
 	
 		well i guess that i would like to to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or
 		um have a legitimate use for the the the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the the problems in DC come home very quickly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		i'm i'm sure yeah um so you would take a position where somebody without without a uh um
 		specific use in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home uh you wouldn't you wouldn't like them to be able to do that is that
 	
 	
 		well i'm not so sure about that but i think somehow uh safety courses
 		or i don't know whether this could be something that was done in school but somehow people
 		i'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were whether they followed them or not you know at least there's the moral issue that they they knew better
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is sort of you know flaky but still
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah i i have i i have the impression that that the
 		the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not are are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway
 		um that may be wrong um you know i mean certainly there there are cases of of you know the children who find their parents' gun or something and and
 		shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided and that's that's certainly within the channels right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um
 		a lot of the the crime i think that goes on i i don't know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know this morning in our paper it there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license so he went over there and got a driver's license the same day bought three guns
 		and went up to New York and sold them for you know very high markups now in a sense that's a legal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		way of getting the guns but certainly the the purpose is not very legal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh  yeah i i mean i think uh some states or i i i don't know if anybody actually has implemented i think so um  at least there's been talk about doing uh
 		you know like waiting periods and and things like that um and and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know i i think stuff like that  is perfectly good i mean basically if you if you don't intend to do anything strange you know if you if you're buying it for legitimate purposes
 		waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem you know and and things i don't know i've
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know i uh i don't own a gun and and don't really want one and i'd just as soon a lot fewer people did um but on the other hand you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		know uh like i say i kind of kind of against government control in general uh
 	
 	
 		right and i suppose complete uh you know complete total ban would lead to more illegal weapons
 	
 	
 		yeah and i you know something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that it they're not gonna disappear anytime soon um and they're already
 		i know there's a ready market for them you know in the stolen the stolen stolen guns can be sold i mean their first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		right because uh because they they can be so easily sold
 		and you know their their i don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country but um it's not like they're gonna disappear all of a sudden
 		um even if you do do a total ban on them
 		uh-huh it's a real tough problem
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i i don't know i don't know where i
 		really come down on it i mean i i grew up my father was a hunter right and that's and that's sort of almost a separate issue i think we've generally been talking about handguns  and that kind of thing right
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and
 	
 	
 		but that's true i mean some people grew up with guns in the house we never had any in the house so to me the you know the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and i'm not sure that's good either
 	
 	
 		yeah  well we you know we i grew up with them i never really took to hunting i mean i did some of it but uh
 		you know we didn't have any we never had any handguns or anything like that we had you know had shotguns for for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know it was a whole different thing and and gun safety was taken very seriously and it was you know i mean before we go hunting we we took safety courses
 		but it you know that's that seems to me just to be a whole another issue  um you know the the thing that the  i yeah i'm not certain that people are are are terribly concerned about other people
 	
 	
 		um-hum
