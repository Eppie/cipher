 		yeah it's real nice has it been raining
 	
 	
 		um it stopped raining
 		let's see
 		Monday Monday or Tuesday Monday it stopped raining it's been raining
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah it's it was raining until yesterday here
 	
 	
 		until then
 		was it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's but it has been real icky well no it it rained Monday night it rained
 		it stopped raining Monday night like Tuesday it was it was clear but it's been really nasty the clouds have been over cast even though it's been kind of warm so that it is muggy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that wasn't very good either
 	
 	
 		did you get some snow a while back
 	
 	
 		uh we did we got snow about a week and a half ago
 	
 	
 		that's what i thought
 	
 	
 		and it was it was really wild because uh
 		the snow was um
 		it didn't stick
 	
 	
 		oh uh
 	
 	
 		but it flurried and you could see it
 		but it uh it didn't stick any
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it was nice it turned into it was like rain it because it was warm even it was above freezing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow
 	
 	
 		but it was between uh
 		just where the clouds were and where you know but when the snow got down here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was cold enough to freeze it and then it just stayed frozen it was wet snow i guess is what they call it when is starts thawing before it hits the ground
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we haven't had anything like that
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah it's only um it's only froze we have only had two freezes so far this winter but i think it is going to be a lot warmer soon
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well i am wondering about the summer what is summer going to be like if winter is this temperate
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		we are bound to have a real dozy of a summer
 	
 	
 		that's what i think  but with all this rain all the all the flowers ought to be real pretty
 	
 	
 		but
 		i don't know i've i've had um i have Easter lilies that i grow in my back yard and they have already started up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and it's way too early
 	
 	
 		yes it is
 	
 	
 		for Easter lilies they shouldn't be up until March when the the flowers actually start to bloom
 	
 	
 		yeah i've seen Day lilies uh not Day lilies daffodils around town uh and blooming
 	
 	
 		already coming in bloom
 	
 	
 		and blooming
 	
 	
 		oh please
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i put down crocus this year thinking oh well it will get cold in January and February you know and i won't have to worry about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't think i am going to get crocus this spring
 	
 	
 		you might not you might not
 	
 	
 		no i don't think it got cold enough for them to come out
 	
 	
 		but do you have the wild flowers up there
 	
 	
 		we don't have as many wild flowers here as there are down toward Austin i use to go to school in San Marcus so i'm familiar with Austin and the area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they ought to be really pretty this year
 	
 	
 		i think so i think the highways are going to be great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm ready to travel
 	
 	
 		yeah we like to go out and take pictures of them and everything it they ought to be really off of two ninety especially is real nice
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh i agree that's a
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband said with all the rain this year that it ought to be real real nice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i agree and it's be probably be wonderful out there
 	
 	
 		well this kind of weather today i feel like getting outside
 	
 	
 		well i'm wishing i'm i'm wishing i had made a picnic for my son and i put down a blanket or a a sleeping bag and had a picnic outside
 	
 	
 		yeah that would've been nice
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's what'll be great when all the wild flowers come out take yourself out a picnic and
 	
 	
 		right
 		well the weather man said it's suppose to start raining again for us tomorrow
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and through the weekend
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we're not suppose to get it until about Monday Sunday night or Monday
 	
 	
 		oh maybe it'll might we might not get it here when
 	
 	
 		well we've uh yeah we have
 	
 	
 		well they told us it was going to rain today too we don't have the most reliable weather men
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i guess not
 	
 	
 		no they said it was going to rain today
 	
 	
 		although they revise they revise our weather report about every other day it changes it seems like but hey have been saying it was going to rain

 		Saturday afternoon but now we are under a big high
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or high pressure

 		so we're um
 		we're going to be stable for a while they say through Sunday
 	
 	
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		yeah that'd be
 	
 	
 		maybe we might get some of that it seems like there's a line there at Waco where it'll come to Waco and then go and we won't get it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or it'll go up as far as Waco and then move over and Dallas won't get it
