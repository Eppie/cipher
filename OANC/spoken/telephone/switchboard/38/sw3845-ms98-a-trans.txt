 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well what do you think about  your everyday occurrences that are that are an invasion of your privacy
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well the uh what i really  i don't like is the call the constant calls people selling things people telling me i won things
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know  people trying to solicit for different you know organizations
 		now that's what i really
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that that's the only thing i wrote down also because that's just a
 		it's terrible today i mean my wife and i  it seems like i get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and and it rings up until ten and eleven o'clock sometimes
 	
 	
 		never stops ringing right
 		that's right well you know the the great uh things of that its a is is an answering machine  i mean this is this is the one of the best inventions ever you know you just switch that thing on and uh
 	
 	
 		yes i know that's true
 		
 
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know people
 		it's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls
 		i mean i must get at least i probably average at least a call a day and and a lot a days i'll get to and three calls from
 	
 	
 		hum even in an office
 	
 	
 		from people selling insurance you know to the small business man
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your according to what i've understand Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names your name out to people also as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in New York and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		California always trying to sell something oil oil investments or stock investments or whatever
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and now i getting the same calls at at the house
 	
 	
 		um-hum i know
 	
 	
 		and they get your and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet and uh credit card companies they sell your name
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh well you know these people they sell your names i mean you know i that's also an invasion of privacy i think if the whole thing is a
 	
 	
 		i know
 		yes
 		American Express does that by the way
 	
 	
 		oh they do
 	
 	
 		yeah i understand they sell their you know they sell names because it's quite profitable to them
 	
 	
 		well sure it is
 	
 	
 		and uh that is an invasion of privacy you're right
 	
 	
 		that's right well you know if you've ever gotten anything you know in your life your your name is somewhere  i mean one magazine and boom they got your name forever
 	
 	
 		i know that's true
 		exactly magazine companies uh  from from subscriptions do the same thing it's the way they make additional money
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but it's uh you know i guess it uh you have to be a certain income holder to uh have an American Express card so your name is valuable to i guess X amount of solicitors calling
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		so i don't know
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		where where do you where you from
 	
 	
 		oh i'm from Texas
 	
 	
 		oh okay well so yeah we live in the Dallas area Richardson
 	
 	
 		oh well we're in Plano
 	
 	
 		okay laughter
 	
 	
 		well you know the only call i really got that well was out of state i got one from Oklahoma City and one from California
 	
 	
 		did you
 	
 	
 		and that was uh California i was thrilled to death because that's the you know the furthest i'd gotten any call from you know and um
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got i talked to people in Utah people in New York and a lot of times i'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning and i'll get people you know from out of the uh out of the state
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh
 		yeah see well that's uh that there was another call on Saturday Saturday that was also from uh that was the one from California
 		i don't know why i guess people on the weekends  from out of state will uh i don't know you know but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'll be darn where you from not from Texas
 	
 	
 		uh originally from New Jersey
 	
 	
 		New Jersey right yeah my wife's from New Jersey
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really what part
 	
 	
 		yeah from Saddle River
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice over there yeah we're from more uh from sort of towards the shore central New Jersey you know we're like uh
 	
 	
 		she
 		okay
 		well that's nice too
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah it was beautiful that's why i i really miss it i i don't really like it here at all
 	
 	
 		really yes my wife's been away since we've been married twenty five years so she she's been away for quite a while
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		her dad was from Little Rock Arkansas and her mother was from New York so they just
 	
 	
 		yeah so their
 	
 	
 		they officed over there in New Jersey
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but anyway yeah this topic is it's a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy but that's the the biggest one i can think of is just all the solicitors calling
 	
 	
 		well yeah i mean yeah yeah and i know of course they call and you know before i got the answering machine it was ridiculous you know i said this is absurd i the you know i the the minute i get home the phone would be ringing uh
 	
 	
 		i know
 		that's a that's a good suggestion i might start using the answering machine more because you know it's so hard to  not pick up that phone when it rings
 	
 	
 		oh it's great i mean
 		well you know in fact i've been missing calls from the TI switchboard because i i always have it on you know and i'll get that that that message that says uh uh to to uh um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you uh know end this call press three and i assumed i you know was from the switchboard you know  yeah it is because one day i listened you know and it was
 	
 	
 		sure
 		you yeah you're probably right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know but um i i just got totally disgusted and and you know people asking for for money for everything you know i mean it
 	
 	
 		i understand i mean i it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriff's association and
 	
 	
 		exactly and you know the policeman's association and
 	
 	
 		i know they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival carnival or circus and then
 	
 	
 		oh i used to do that yeah i used to do that i'd say or three kids to the movies or something
 	
 	
 		right there's always a different and i my my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night
