 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right uh
 		do you have any friends who have children
 	
 	
 		i do have friends that have children yes
 	
 	
 		and what do they say about finding adequate child care i think that may be the key word
 	
 	
 		they
 		i think that's correct there i relatively not existent from uh from what i hear from my friends it seems like uh
 		even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word uh still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh it's just a matter of of trust you know i think they feel that these people are um under qualified basically and underpaid
 		and i think that sort of goes hand in hand so it's it's difficult for them
 	
 	
 		well we've certainly found that to be true uh indeed we've
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		our children are now eleven and nine and we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things like that uh by that name
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and found that uh more creative avenues were the right answer for us uh at one point in time we've had au pairs
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		by trading services with them
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		then that worked for a while but they were really adequate ones were really tough to find it takes that
 	
 	
 		i'm sure that's true
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		that uh mixture of a very mature college student
 		who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and the interest to the children
 	
 	
 		right i do have a friend that uh uh she and her roommate became live in uh care givers and they they loved it they had stayed with this family from the time
 		these children were small you know four or five years old up until they were well into grade school
 		and uh she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them and they you know had done such a good job
 		so um i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the finances to be able to do that
 	
 	
 		well that's true and that's something that we're struggling with now as
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think it's just a matter of priorities it's uh
 		you know a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way but you still have to be realistic as well i think
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know any you
 		much as uh
 		other cultures might disagree our lives don't revolve around our children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah and that's that's that's sad to have to admit too but uh
 		you know it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about uh two people that work outside the home and and i think that's one reason why i continue to be without children i
 		it's just such a such a responsibility and and when i've had friends that have said
 		when you hear people say it alters your life forever please take heed and realize that that's true so it's uh such a responsibility
 	
 	
 		well it certainly is uh
 		if i can gather the other side of the coin for a moment it is such an honor and a thrill
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		to be a parent
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		that most of the time it's worth it
 	
 	
 		yeah most of the time
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know i i just have to be honest about it it's not always worth it
 	
 	
 		yeah oh sure sure
 	
 	
 		there are those times when i think jeez if i didn't have children i could be out playing bridge or golf
 	
 	
 		sure
 		right right right right
 		but you know it's it's funny i did i i had a friend that said you know before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other and she got older she said but you know we never do those things anyway so
 		why  why am i waiting you know it's just the it's just the way your attitude changes and you mature i suppose but
 		the thing about the child care i
 		you know i have friends that struggle financially and and they both do have to work it's a matter of not necessarily uh that she might want to stay home or he as well but you know that they need the money
 		and uh when i seen some of my my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know to someone else and
 		it's just i can imagine how emotional it must be and and you know multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation you've been placed in as far as child care goes um it's it's just a scary thing
 	
 	
 		well we were lucky when our children were that age and
 		living having lived in a community for a while and we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um um that's a big plus yes
 	
 	
 		and and felt that that bond of safety and feeling of safety
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and leaving them with them as small children
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but we also learned something from that experience as our children got older in that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh care givers are not
 		omniscious omniscipotent they're they are not all things to all people or all children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right right
 	
 	
 		the the ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum um-hum
 		i think it takes a lot i i don't know i think your patient level must needs to increase as the child gets older  i think that might be part of the problem with some people
 		you know taking care of a baby i know is not an easy thing but when you have them in their their little feet are moving and you have to chase them down constantly i'm sure that's a whole new ball game
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i got a nine year old i'd trade happily for a babe in arms today
 	
 	
 		oh really  well you sound like your pretty well maybe passed the worst of it as far as worrying about since they're both in school you don't have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them
 	
 	
 		oh you don't know what happens after they get in school
 	
 	
 		
 
 		is that that's something all together different huh
 	
 	
 		oh yes now we have uh one takes piano lessons at at somewhere on one afternoon and the other one of course can't do the same thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh of course not
 	
 	
 		and it has to be somewhere else and no it's not adequate to sit and wait
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you can't do that no
 	
 	
 		no no no no that's just that will not do
 	
 	
 		no no no no
 		that's out of the question i'm sure
 	
 	
 		of course and but we are helping we are you know we are being cooperative what's wrong with you you don't understand this uh that's just the way their minds work and it's almost everyday
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right right um-hum um-hum
 		that's amazing it's amazing that people actually th e stamina that you must you know draw from yourself to deal with it it must be interesting i guess you find find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought maybe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i've been finding out that i really am a nice person but it's been hidden for many years
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because i didn't need it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and now i need it
 	
 	
 		and now it's just uh it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly i'm sure
 	
 	
 		yeah and and it stays low a lot
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well are your are your children now do you feel comfortable um with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home or
 	
 	
 		absolutely not
 	
 	
 		no yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean  one of them i would i would um leave unsupervised any time any place any where uh the other one i wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 		that's just a difference in kids i suppose
 	
 	
 		that's true what one leads the other you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and if you
 	
 	
 		and it's it's the one that's going they're going downhill is it is it the one that needs needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or on the more mature one
 	
 	
 		of course
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		how unfortunate
 	
 	
 		you you don't you don't think that good prevails
 	
 	
 		well i you know i'm living in a dream world what do i know as i said i don't have kids and i'm an only child so i've never been around children
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh i'm sort of at a a loss where that's concerned but i do hear my friends talk about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we're we're having such fun my wife and i were both only children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		friends um-hum
 	
 	
 		wrong
 	
 	
 		that's like World War Three every minute
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i i have to admit i was a selfish i was selfish as a child i didn't want a brother or sister and now that i'm older of course it's different you know i think about uh wouldn't it be nice but uh anyway
 	
 	
 		just make good friends
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i have wonderful friends that's that's true my best friend is one child of ten
 		so uh they just sort of you know adopted me as their eleventh child so that worked out pretty well she never had to worry about uh taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them so i guess that's that's an alternative you could just
 	
 	
 		have enough
 	
 	
 		um have have a whole bunch and by the time the little the youngest ones are are there you'll have old ones to take care of them
 		yeah yeah i don't know it just see when you see all these these uh horror stories on television about child care and
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		gosh i just i was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories and of course people are denying it
 		and uh it's just frightening it really is
 	
 	
 		well what what's frightening is a parent to see things that that you don't really understand
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then you don't really know what happened we gave up on one babysitter because we came home one night and found
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		pieces of um
 		uh ribbon you know hair ribbon
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		tied in a chair
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		where obviously she had had
