 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay so um how do think how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years
 	
 	
 		uh i'm at a little bit of a loss you know i don't know ten years ago see i'm what i'm about uh twenty eight now so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when i was eighteen things haven't changed a whole lot people are being a little more uh
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know a little less a little less bigoted in some ways i don't know seems to me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i guess i'm like my parents the younger generation gets away with hell but uh
 	
 	
 		well
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well it seems to me that
 		civic freedoms are more restricted but that may just be because i've changed you know i used to live up north Down here Dallas seems to me the police are militant but uh
 	
 	
 		really
 		where'd you live up where'd you live at
 	
 	
 		i lived in Akron Ohio
 	
 	
 		oh did you i'm from  Illinois
 		so how long how long you been in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh about eight years
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		in fact in the eight years i've been here it seems to me it gets more and more gets to be more and more restrictive place to live
 	
 	
 		yeah uh you know uh as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do
 	
 	
 		i think
 		yeah well i think it's crime has gone got a lot worse in the last last ten fifteen years and maybe that has a lot to do with it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i agree
 		yeah i i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse and you know i i think there's to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved but that's more a matter of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i'm no longer a teenager in high school got to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah think i think there's more pressure like on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be and
 	
 	
 		hello
 		somebody's at the door hang on just a second
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		go ahead i'm on the phone all right
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't know that's just that's one thing i see i see a lot more you know double income families and a lot more
 		like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true it's uh getting more and more expensive to live
 	
 	
 		yeah that's for sure
 	
 	
 		you know you can't you can't make it
 	
 	
 		yeah without it hardly that's right
 	
 	
 		i guess when i was growing up it was it was still the ideal to get a get a home and buy house and those good thing these days you see a lot of people living in apartments
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		forever you know you just don't buy a house
 	
 	
 		yeah just because they can't get into one yeah that's right
 		yeah the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's good point so
 		i'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years
 	
 	
 		yeah i see for me it's kind of hard i don't know i think
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know i think the middle class is shrinking and the uh
 		lower class is expanding and sooner or later there's going to there's going to be a turn around
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i agree
 		well i hope so you know at some point but i don't know at what point
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but i think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so usually is i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's uh
 	
 	
 		it's hard for me to say i hope it happens because i'd be one of those that gets caught but on the other hand there's a lot of injustice that needs to be be changed
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's right do you work at T I
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what what uh department do you work in
 	
 	
 		i'm in semiconductor
 	
 	
 		are you so i'm in semiconductor division too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so how long you been with them since you moved down here
 	
 	
 		about eight years yeah
 	
 	
 		um i'm over at the Center One building
 	
 	
 		yeah so am i
 	
 	
 		are you really what floor
 	
 	
 		yep
 		two
 	
 	
 		i'm on the seventh floor
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		how about that well it's a small world
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so so let's see second floor you work for uh Linear
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you do you uh do you know Alec Morton
 	
 	
 		yeah i've probably seen him around
 	
 	
 		oh you do huh well he comes up and pushes us around so uh
 		so um so i'm pretty familiar with
 	
 	
 		are you D A D or something up there are you D A D or something
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yep you must know him his reputation precedes him
 	
 	
 		yeah well seventh floor
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		T A D
 	
 	
 		well uh he uh boy he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief they they say it's what makes him happy is to give us DADers grief so i can believe it
 		but
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		yeah let's see if you've been in Dallas eight years guess i guess that's about how long i've i've been in here about eight years too i guess um been with T I like twelve but i started out in Lubbock
 		and uh
 		Lubbock Lubbock is i don't know i guess if this is the only place you've lived Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah flat dry and dirty
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah yeah but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too i mean
 		here in Dallas everything is just real rush rush
 	
 	
 		yeah i lived in the country for several years and living in the city is a whole different uh social structure but uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		well i got s ome friends that uh  seems like he went to school at like DeVry is there a DeVry in Akron
 	
 	
 		i don't even know haven't been up there in years
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh i see well he went to school somewhere in Ohio and he's from that area
 		and uh he works over in the Park Park Central building i think
 		but uh  i haven't talked to him in a while but um
 		yeah he he misses it he used to go back twice or three times a year you know because he missed it sounds like you haven't been back there in a while
 	
 	
 		no i haven't been back in fifteen ten fifteen years
 	
 	
 		you still have relatives back there or
 	
 	
 		yeah i do i just haven't had a chance to get back
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um catch them next year probably
 	
 	
 		really
 		well let's see how how long are we supposed to talk here
 	
 	
 		i don't know i think we ran out of social social changes to talk about so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well my my kids are probably needing me to go so
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right well it's nice talking to you talk to you later bye
