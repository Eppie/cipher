 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay sorry
 	
 	
 		wow that's okay so tell me about your home
 	
 	
 		oh it's uh it looks like a little shot gun house almost
 		it's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's uh
 		an older home it's not new i like it though it's big
 	
 	
 		oh really what kind of square footage
 	
 	
 		oh i wouldn't know i measured it one time
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because i was uh
 		we had saw some termites and we thought about getting it sprayed i think it was like
 		i can't remember i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		that's okay that's okay
 	
 	
 		it's big enough for us though we kind of need maybe one more room we've got two children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		okay so where do you live at i mean what what part of town
 	
 	
 		
 
 		in here in Dennison
 	
 	
 		okay let's see that's north
 	
 	
 		or down here in Dennison yeah
 	
 	
 		okay i live i live in Plano so it's north to me
 	
 	
 		okay up here then i say down i'm really from Kentucky
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i was going to say you didn't have the typical you have a southern accent but you don't have a Texas accent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		well i'm originally from uh Ohio Cincinnati so i'm familiar uh familiar with uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		that area that dialect
 	
 	
 		right right  also i lived in Georgia for about four years so the uh there's a difference too between east and west in the south
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh the way in which people speak anyway my home is um
 		i guess it's about twenty five hundred square foot and i have uh four bedrooms at the present we're busting out walls and things like that
 	
 	
 		that's what i want to do how many kids do you have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we have two
 	
 	
 		do you have enough bedroom space then
 	
 	
 		we have two
 		yeah we'll have enough bedroom space it's we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit
 	
 	
 		that's kind of like what we would like to do we just had a baby a couple months ago and we've got a den that's more or less a spare room we rarely go in there except for to play chess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we need the one extra room like like i said our rooms are too small the bedrooms are too small the living room and kitchen are huge but the bedrooms are too small where you've got to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		leave the furniture just one certain way you can't rearrange it at all
 	
 	
 		right
 		there's they uh i know what you're saying there ours is the same and they tend to put windows in the strangest places
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		You know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom
 	
 	
 		um-hum you you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no privacy
 	
 	
 		uh no we don't have a lot of that yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'd hate to clean these windows i really would
 	
 	
 		i figured i'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean ours are the double pane and you can't really clean them on the inside
 	
 	
 		ours are those too yeah you must live in an older home too then
 	
 	
 		you know
 		right i do the house is about um i'd say almost thirty years old
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's not a new home it's it's seen some wear and tear
 	
 	
 		ours has too now when we moved in the man that sold it to us had said he had remodeled it
 	
 	
 		you know
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		he did it hisself so most of that by now is falling apart
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know well i mean it's not just horrible but like this tiles come loose off the wall the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile and i don't like that at all
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh that is awful
 	
 	
 		with that
 		uh the great big tiles square tiles like that you put on the floor
 	
 	
 		uh-huh he did it in that
 	
 	
 		the the huge one yeah instead of wallpaper i wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles for that
 	
 	
 		the normal tiles right
 	
 	
 		you put right that you put around a bathtub that would be prettier
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but this looks like floor
 		covering on the wall it just doesn't look good
 	
 	
 		oh and also they're very heavy and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier
 	
 	
 		right there's one big one that has come off and short of putting nails through it we can't get it back on
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so
 		and he rewired the house and it's shorting out here and there and
 	
 	
 		oh wow i that's one of the things we've been fortunate with is our wiring been okay we don't have a we don't have enough power
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um our our breakers aren't aren't powerful enough to take to to really help with the load in the house i mean we need to redo some rewiring ourselves but our plumbing is awful there is nothing there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 	
 	
 		and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street you know and oh it's it can be really bizarre  and we never know where it's going to flood
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		we've got power surges on the west side of our house we've got our stereo hooked up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well that the power makes it run it's never ran it's always ran just fine the clock and stuff but it runs about ten minutes fast except for about a month for about a month the the clock ran normal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		and then the power went off again lightning or something knocked it out and we hooked it back up and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again but on the east side of the house it runs fine
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh boy you do have a strange wiring problem there
 	
 	
 		he put new wiring in it's all new wiring up in the attic or i guess crawl space
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		oh no he didn't know what he was doing he really should have hired people
 	
 	
 		well that's something my husband's in construction and he won't even touch electrical stuff he i i mean he'll do a little minimal things but he won't do any major rewiring he says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right he'll end up killing himself
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		end up killing theirselves
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		my husband he'll change out a light switch but that's about as far as he'll go
 	
 	
 		well that's the way mine is you know i mean he he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around and he was like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh my God he says looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh was a what
 	
 	
 		the roof was really sorry i mean when we moved in we had no idea how bad it was it was a wood shingle roof and we the first year we were living there we had to replace the roof
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well he put which i heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles is it three or five your husband probably knows
 	
 	
 		he probably knows i don't know what it is off hand
 	
 	
 		well he's got seven layers of shingles up there and he told us it was a completely new roof like i said he didn't know what he was doing
 	
 	
 		yeah he must not of we stripped ours we stripped ours off we didn't put it over because we put composition roof on and we completely stripped completely stripped all the old wood shingles off put decking up
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		put the paper down and i mean just started from scratch unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain and we and we had we had almost i'd say about half of the roof off
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh no
 		and uh uh a house full of snow
 	
 	
 		and it did this
 		and a house full of snow and rain and it came down it did this in the middle of the night we have plastic you know just tied down on everything you know as best we could real thick gauge stuff i mean
 		and the wind came in from the north and just blew everything off in the middle of the night and we were asleep and and i woke up and i got up and it was about four o'clock in the morning and i heard all these these drips drip drip drip drip drip drip
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		i had water coming in every light fixture
 	
 	
 		that's yeah
 	
 	
 		i had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling everywhere and i mean it filled up my light fixtures because they're the old kind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i would go in and i'd turn on a light in the room you know and the light would come on and the whole thing would be full of water and i mean the light would still come on  it didn't blow up or anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my neighbor or a friend of mine when i lived in Louisiana her
 		we all lived on base my husband was in the Army
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning water dripping from hers the neighbor's  uh washing machine
 		had uh
 		overdone something i don't know but it was leaking just pouring water and it all went through to her roof and it was coming out of the lights fixtures
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		the fire alarm went off for some reason it shorted it out or something
 		so she woke up with about six
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that'll happen
 	
 	
 		feet of water in her house
 	
 	
 		oh my Lord
 	
 	
 		no not six feet but
 	
 	
 		but it's quite a bit quite a bit you know that
 	
 	
 		yeah you might as well so did you have carpets and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh several of our rooms got ruined we have um we have are on pier and beam we don't have concrete slab underneath our house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it it got into the carpeting got into the floor the carpeting was already awful anyway but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink so
 	
 	
 		your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah they came in and they had it one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it we had to call the insurance company i mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof roof was being repaired
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know which really wasn't our fault i mean we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right right
 	
 	
 		you know and stuff and
 	
 	
 		well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in  are you finished with it now
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it it
 		uh the roof oh yeah yeah it's it's been done for quite some time we're really glad with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		how long have you lived there
 	
 	
 		uh see it's three it's just been at at three years we've been in the house just the three years we've been doing a lot of remodeling i mean it's
 		it had a detached it had a drive detached garage and my husband's built a walkway across and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that so we
 	
 	
 		you all did it yourselves
 	
 	
 		what uh the walk
 	
 	
 		the home improvements
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah he see he does this for a living i mean this is what
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
