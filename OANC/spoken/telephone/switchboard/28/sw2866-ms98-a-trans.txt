 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well Myrna how do you get your news news
 	
 	
 		uh most of it is from the radio uh and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we usually watch the local news and the the uh national news both
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i'm pretty much the same i uh i find that uh i'm a graduate student and i i read a lot for school and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i just i'm reading so much all the time
 		and i really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast
 	
 	
 		well you can always get up and leave that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that that yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		uh i do i just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper either by the time i get home from work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's already you know time for the news to come on
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's so much easier to sit there and besides i can be doing other things and still listening to the news
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right i i agree that's a lot of times i eat while i'm uh watching the news
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah the same thing is there any uh what did you think about the coverage like over in the uh Persian Gulf
 	
 	
 		i think they did a great job
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought so too it was it you know for a while when we were really interested uh we saw it all the time some of the stations i guess carried it for twenty four hours for a couple of days there and then you know the special reports
 		and the extended news coverage i thought was really good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and you could always find some channel that had something on but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah right yeah just news that's right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i noticed that one thing that that TI did you know they had uh uh they used to have we
 		well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings and they used to have a program called T News and just updates of of different things that were going on within TI well when all the the mess with uh uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in the Persian Gulf came about they started carrying CNN
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		well now they have had so much good response from this TI now has CNN on all the time
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		huh well that's great
 	
 	
 		so we can always run upstairs and you know catch get a quickie update on what's going on if we really want to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah or if you you have a break in the middle of the day you take a coffee break you can always stay informed
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really good
 		that's um i've found that when i i don't have cable television anymore uh when i moved went back to graduate school i just didn't have the money to buy get rent a cable TV line or whatever you know so i don't get CNN
 		uh which was a big disappointment i used to watch that was my if i
 		wasn't home i'm a college teacher and sometimes i teach in the evening so i'll miss the evening news and uh you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on CNN i think that's
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that really has changed the way um i look at the news
 	
 	
 		yeah we don't get it either we live out in the country and we just don't have it available out there where we are
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but when we did have it uh we that's what we usually watched the weather stations
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's uh same yeah that's when i had it i i watched it you know religiously for half an hour and then you could go on you know to do what else you wanted to do yeah i find i read very little i don't even get a regular newspaper and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh because uh i i don't drive that much i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work i uh
 		i find i spend so little time in the radio in the car that i don't really listen to the radio
 		you know i don't so so television is my main news source
 	
 	
 		oh i get that too because i i'm in a van pool and i'm in the van you know uh two hours a day an yes yes and in the in the morning i try to sleep because it's it's dark thirty
 	
 	
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 		oh really to commute to work oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but in but in the afternoon uh i try to read so i can can uh not pay attention to what our driver is doing
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i can the van pools i know that and i'm in the Baltimore Washington area and i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas but if you want a nicer home you know beyond the suburbs you know i that's necessary
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah are are you in Baltimore itself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i am i am right outside Baltimore i am less than a mile from the Baltimore line and i go to a block a campus of the University of Maryland that is just less than a mile from my house
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so i i'm actually in Baltimore yeah you could say i'm in Baltimore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i have two kids over there
 	
 	
 		oh really in Baltimore
 	
 	
 		uh well no in in DC area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah one works for the State Department and uh uh the other one is uh
 		uh her husband is in the Marines Navy and he's stationed at Bethesda and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh that's
 		that's that's a really nice area Bethesda area uh-huh it's um it's funny there's a big difference between Baltimore and Washington even though they're so close there's only an hour less than that between the two but there is a big difference in things like property values
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um the closer you get to Washington DC the more expensive it is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		an um
 		the the uh different slant Washington it really is a uh
 		uh an international city
 		where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore you know it there's really uh most people have relocated to the Washington area  you know
 	
 	
 		oh no i'd i'd rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere
 	
 	
 		yeah that's i i like it i like it a little bit better too it's interesting though um to meet different populations i i'm just now being uh from Pittsburgh originally i'm just now meeting different populations like Chinese students and things
 		and i find that really interesting you know to imagine here is somebody that was in China last two years ago when all that was going on in in uh Beijing you know that that's an interesting uh
 		interesting perspective but i i really much much like the hometown area yeah
 		and i think that also goes it's funny you you can watch different news i can watch Washington news or Baltimore news and i really do watch Baltimore news
 		you know that really makes i don't really bother with the Washington station because i just it's so far removed from what i'm interested in
 	
 	
 		well most of what they're talking about in Washington is is the
 		crime problems that they're having there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah they in fact they just it was just a big thing recently they've had some terrible problems with Hispanics um they had to impose a curfew
 		that uh in two of the areas in uh in the Washington suburbs the mayor they've gotten rid of that
 		really bad mayor and then uh brought in yeah and then came a woman that's um she's big in the Democratic party
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i heard about that
 	
 	
 		so that's good so she has good national ties but she also was um
 		something like a  uh state auditor or something like that before this position she was a state auditor
 		i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia at Washington and then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party and now she ran for mayor so she's uh fiscally she's pretty tight
 		and uh she's cleaning house an and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job uh for Washington you know which is you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there you know from what i pick up on the news uh
 		it's a difficult process you know to get rid of a a bad mayor
 	
 	
 		yeah well i know both of my kids didn't want to live anywhere around the the downtown areas they both moved way out
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		i think one of them lives in Germantown and i can't remember where the other one lives
 	
 	
 		yeah but those are nice Germantown is a nice area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's a nice area
 	
 	
 		yeah it's means they have to drive a little bit but
 	
 	
 		yeah well they might be car pooling too do they car pool in are they driven by themselves
 	
 	
 		uh well now i i think he carpools because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back but uh now my daughter has they have probably been carpooling together in fact because she had been called back up active duty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh oh
 	
 	
 		and then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last Friday
 		so i haven't talked to them this weekend i don't know what the situation is but she was
 	
 	
 		um-hum they didn't call you for mother's day
 	
 	
 		uh we were gone
 	
 	
 		you weren't home huh
 	
 	
 		no we weren't home but she had she had left called and left a message on our recorder but i had that from all my kids except for one
 	
 	
 		yeah oh that's good
 		well i guess we should stop now
 	
 	
 		so
 		well i thank you for calling i have enjoyed it i really do like this program because i get to talk to people from all over the United States yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh good
 		uh uh so do i i've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever i i really enjoyed it it's it's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective
 		it's interesting to see the the wider world so i enjoy it hey thanks a lot and and bye
 	
 	
 		thank you bye bye
