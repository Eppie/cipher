 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and sometimes we'll even go during the daytime for lunch
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		so if we have the opportunity just because it's quieter
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we don't like the bar atmosphere
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they usually stick you in there for an hour you know or even when there are plenty of tables that always makes me mad that just to get you to buy drinks i guess and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		now
 	
 	
 		i don't mind waiting thirty minutes but boy if it gets over thirty minutes it really irritates me
 	
 	
 		yeah and we aren't drinkers so you know for us that's just kind of wasted time time we just but now we do go to this one little place out here on the expressway uh Cheddars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh yeah i
 	
 	
 		and they have a uh
 	
 	
 		i ate there Friday as a matter of fact at lunch
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum well they have a big screen TV
 	
 	
 		yeah in Dallas the one in Fort Worth
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		in their bar area lounge area and we don't mind that because we both love basketball and like to watch basketball
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i uh oh i don't like the fights and stuff and sometimes you see those
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but and if if it's a wild and crazy music that turns us off too
 	
 	
 		me too me too
 	
 	
 		but we uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i like uh there's not too many restaurants i don't like to go to i  just i just like to eat out but i uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		we do too we we do too i i wish we could do more often i imagine when all our kids get gone and grown that we'll
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you will mine are mine are grown and gone in fact i'm going over tonight to my son's house he's taking me out tonight for Mother's Day and then my i'm going to brunch in the morning with my daughter for Mother's for Mother's Day uh so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how fun how fun
 	
 	
 		i'll have  of course i'm on a diet but i guess i'll go off of it for this weekend
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well don't you think though there are a lot more options available for people who are watching
 	
 	
 		yeah and you know you

 	
 	
 		you know you're seeing a lot more grilled chicken and fish without breading on it and
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah absolutely and that's
 	
 	
 		you know i never hesitate ever anymore to ask for my dressing on the side or to eliminate sour cream or anything like that and they're always willing to help and accommodate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah they are and i really even all the fast foods they're coming out with the grilled chicken and i eat a lot of those you know and even if i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i i don't eat steak too much i love steak and i have to have it every  every now and then but normally i'm i i try and stay away from the red the red meats if i go to a steak house
 		i will eat one but i don't you know gorge myself
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i love steak too and you know a lot of times we'll our favorite place to eat for steak is Steak and Ale
 	
 	
 		it yeah now i've never gotten a bad meal there have you i just you know they're consistently good
 	
 	
 		hum-um no no
 		and just always you know always quiet and pleasant and
 	
 	
 		yeah they're uh i i found that if you call and make reservations oh i uh you they used to irritate me making us wait so long but uh now i found if i call and make reservations they usually get you in pretty fast so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		oh the uh
 		uh one out here is just always very accommodating you know we like a lot of ethnic foods too we we like to go different places and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i do too
 		well i love Chinese i love oriental food and i love seafood and uh
 		but i also like i i don't mind paying for atmosphere
 	
 	
 		yep yeah i don't either
 	
 	
 		i i
 		it doesn't bother me at all and uh if i
 		and i don't and i'm not opposed to tipping very well if i if the service is good but boy i it really irritates me to
 		well like in Cheddars yesterday i know that the girl just forgot our order and we were on a lunch hour you know and my gosh she just
 	
 	
 		you waiting and waiting and waiting
 	
 	
 		and i know i thought gosh my whole lunch hour i'm just sitting here waiting here for a lousy sandwich
 		so i went ahead and tipped her but i didn't want to
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		was mad
 	
 	
 		yeah and you know that that's part of their wage and that they get busy and stuff you but but you wouldn't tip as much as you would have had
 	
 	
 		yes i know it
 		right yeah right but that that and i do i tip accordingly oh believe me i if the
 	
 	
 		you know the uh
 		i do too i think that that's service related and you know
 	
 	
 		i do too but i hate cheap people that that get good service and don't tip that irritates me just as bad and i've been out with guys that have embarrassed me that don't tip
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know well i  it really uh
 	
 	
 		makes you want to just kind of slip a little more under there
 	
 	
 		yeah it really and i have i have slipped money you know if if the guy didn't tip enough i'll take money out of my purse but a
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and i hope it makes them feel bad but i don't think it does
 	
 	
 		no probably not they figure i guess they figure that's your choice well
 		uh i know uh my i have teenagers
 		and just recently i was out with a group of teenagers for semester exams
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh if i said i would provide transportation at lunchtime for them to go and
 		out to eat and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so all these little kids here they all want their own tickets you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i said right up front now kids actually i kind of said it to my daughter and if i was going to do it again i would say it to the whole group because
 		i was too uh i was i was too shy i didn't not too shy i just didn't want to embarrass her
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but what happened was i ended up having to loan money to those kids because they did not figure in the tip and the tax
 	
 	
 		oh did you really
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		they looked at that and said three ninety five they say i got four dollars i can do this
 	
 	
 		and they thought that really
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so they buy the get the three ninety five item and you know then they didn't have enough for the extra so
 	
 	
 		and i found the also that uh i don't think that waitresses
 		i yeah i was in a survey when i lived in Orlando uh had a was in a survey of restaurants and uh
 		the i a lot of the waiters and waitresses think you know when women come in that that women are lousy tippers and that's why they don't give them as good a service as they do a couple or something like that but i don't think that's true i think women
 	
 	
 		just that you know a single woman an individual of any kind is not going to have as large an order
 	
 	
 		to me
 		right
 	
 	
 		as two or three at a table
 	
 	
 		well i find that women are more willing to give a good tip a bunch of women as
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh couples or or you know  guys together probably
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't think they're that but that they were on this survey they were saying that the
 		that's the notion that women have i mean that waitress and waitresses had
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well i i yeah i definitely disagree with that
 	
 	
 		i like one of my favorites in Dallas is uh Baby Doe's you have you ever eaten there
 	
 	
 		um-hum been a long time been a long time
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah i love it oh gosh it's i like the atmosphere i remember when they first opened up i we went several times
 		and uh it was it was so much fun but i like i said i like to go to restaurants like that i and i like these um
 		have you ever been to what
 		when i lived in Orlando they had call a place called Shakespeare's and they probably have one similar to it here where medieval
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh the medieval
 	
 	
 		yeah those are kind of fun i wouldn't want a steady diet of it but
 	
 	
 		kind of uh a tavern pub kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and have the wenches wait on you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was a lot of fun i i enjoyed that
 	
 	
 		we uh
 		we were at the butcher shop in the West End here recently and that was sure neat it cook your own steak and those steaks were wonderful
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah where you cook your own steak yeah yeah
 		yeah weren't they i i've eaten there that was that's good but
 	
 	
 		it was uh i really enjoyed that
 	
 	
 		i remember back when that was just
 		old warehouses down there i couldn't believe when i moved back to Dallas how that had changed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly exactly same here i grew up in the area
 	
 	
 		yeah i remember i think Spaghetti Warehouse was about the only thing down there for years and years
 	
 	
 		some of my favorite ones have
 	
 	
 		i guess it kind of grew around it
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i moved from in eighty five when i came back all that was uh built back up
 	
 	
 		had all been worked over
 	
 	
 		yeah and i thought you know Deep Ellum i still don't think i'd go to Deep Ellum i don't care how chic it's supposed to be but
 	
 	
 		well there's some wonderful little shops and art
 		
 
 		art galleries and
 	
 	
 		is it really i just could i just from
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		back in the fifties i remember how bad it was and i just it just stuck in my mind and i just wouldn't go down there i don't think especially at night i might during the day but i don't think i'd go at night down there
 		at all
 		because it used to really be rough and tough in fact the only time i ever saw anybody stabbed out we were driving down
 		in the street and saw a guy come out of a theater with a knife sticking out of his back and that just is stuck in my mind and he was walking too uh they were walking him to an ambulance
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and i just
 		i've never gone back since then
 	
 	
 		that was enough to take it
 	
 	
 		no  that's right
 		i don't want to go down there anymore
 	
 	
 		well i think that's
 		those kind of things definitely tend to mark your uh
 	
 	
 		yeah but Dallas has really got a lot of good restaurants
 	
 	
 		they really do i think Dallas is a very uh up and coming area i think it's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah they just
 	
 	
 		it it caters to a lot of business groups and a lot of out of towners and and regulars also and you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 		are you a native Dallasite
 	
 	
 		uh i came here when i was in elementary school so i consider myself native
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well i married a Dallasite and that's how i got here but i would you know i wouldn't trade for it i
 		i'm from California but i
 		i just consider myself a Texan when i moved to Florida i couldn't hardly wait to get back
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i stayed down there four years
 	
 	
 		i think uh you know that uh i think Dallas is becoming diverse enough now to accommodate almost any need
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		or any desires in any kind of cooking you know Indian Greek you name it you know there's there's something for everybody and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum um-hum
 		i'm enjoying living over here in Grapevine and Fort Worth area too for for a change because
 		i'm really discovering Fort Worth they've got a lot of nice restaurants over here that a lot of people don't know about you know
 	
 	
 		our favorite one in Fort Worth is downtown Fort Worth kind of across from the uh
 		The Keg
 	
 	
 		The Keg is it down there by Sundance Square
 	
 	
 		The Keg
 		well it's down you know by the Convention Center
 	
 	
 		yeah i  i
 	
 	
 		i don't know what the street is
 	
 	
 		i'm not real familiar with down there i've been down there to the Sundance Square when i first uh moved back here i met my sister-in-law sister-in-law down there and uh
