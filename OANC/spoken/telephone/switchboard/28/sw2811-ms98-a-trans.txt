 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what i was gonna to tell you about is that my fiance and i have just finished as a matter of fact today restoring a seventy three Mercedes
 	
 	
 		you don't mean it
 	
 	
 		i i we've done a little bit of it ourselves but mostly we were lucky enough to find a a guy that works for a Mercedes dealership and he restores cars on his on his uh you know off time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		how'd you find this one
 	
 	
 		well it was uh a gentleman that works with my fiance and he had bought it for his daughter and she wasn't taking care of it and boy was that obvious when they pulled up in it it had been really um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		pretty shabby shape huh
 	
 	
 		it was in a mess it was just in a terrible mess uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		so what's the last thing you ever had done to it
 	
 	
 		well the last thing we did to it was today they had uh replaced the gear shift
 	
 	
 		my goodness
 	
 	
 		um it's uh it wasn't we had to order the part from the dealership and the guys put it in today when you shifted it down you didn't know if you were in park drive reverse whatever
 	
 	
 		oh i hear you
 	
 	
 		so that was the very last thing that we had to uh had to have done uh basically the whole car's been redone they put in new um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they used new sheet metal and stuff to to repair the body i mean there were you know these rusted dents
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a new paint job they uh redid all of the trim  we had the seats reupholstered we put in a new dash  it's been recarpeted it's just it was you know just completely
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		my goodness
 		um-hum um-hum
 		my gosh y'all put a lot of money in this
 	
 	
 		yeah it was completely overhauled and uh for what
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		is it a Diesel
 	
 	
 		it's a diesel um-hum it sure is
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		i guess it's what four speed on the column
 	
 	
 		yeah you're right um-hum
 	
 	
 		um-hum i seem to recall the old Mercedes had four speeds on the column
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and it's it's just been lovingly restored that's one good thing about about having somebody to do it your you're you're there because they worked on it here at our home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		so how many miles does it have on it
 	
 	
 		i have no idea i i doubt that anybody will ever really know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		why is the speedometer was disconnected or something
 	
 	
 		well i i i can't really remember what it shows on there but i remember when we discussed it we said that we were pretty sure that that was like times maybe or add an additional one hundred added on to that a hundred thousand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um
 		i hear you
 	
 	
 		yeah because it's uh it had definitely been through the mill but uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i got a little car that uh has a certain history to it too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's an old seventy one Maverick and i'm not trying to redo the body or anything
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've had it to drive back and forth to work now for some i guess nineteen years or so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum oh my gosh you've had it
 	
 	
 		and it's got two hundred and one thousand miles on it
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		and it's an automatic transmission and it's just a regular old everyday go back and forth to work car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i uh i guess the interesting history about this is about the only work i do on it myself an the last time i did do some work was i did a brake job on it
 		and that cost me fourteen dollars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		by buying the parts at one of the local discount parts houses you know and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and luckily this time didn't need to have drums turned or anything
 	
 	
 		replaced yeah
 	
 	
 		then i was able to do a brake job on there at fairly i think inexpensive price by doing it myself of course
 	
 	
 		yeah oh definitely
 	
 	
 		but another interesting aspect of this car like yours is
 		uh it's only had the oil changed about six times since uh seventy five thousand miles
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because i only change the oil every twenty five thousand miles
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i do change oil filters every twelve thousand five hundred though
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh other than that it only has the oil changed every twenty five thousand miles and that is a a true statement i just wrote Mobil Oil Corporation a letter as a matter of fact
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		two weeks ago thanking them for the uh good durability that Mobil One oil which is what i use in it provides
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because it does have two hundred and one thousand honest miles
 	
 	
 		gosh that's unbelievable
 	
 	
 		and it's only had the oil changed those few times and uh it uh performs very nicely it's shifting the uh transmission of course i get overhauled on it not overhauled but
 	
 	
 		hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		all the uh fluid drained out and new screen and and filters and everything put them in every fifty thousand miles religiously
 	
 	
 		right right
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it still shifts just a crisp today as it did when it was brand new
 	
 	
 		that's amazing that is amazing
 	
 	
 		and the engine still runs just as strong today as it did when it was brand new
 	
 	
 		is it the same engine that's been in it all the time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah the the engine's never had any work done on it all except at ninety five thousand miles i think it was uh we rebuilt the carburetor and a hundred thirty five thousand miles we put a new uh water pump on it no internal work has ever been done on the engine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's had uh three starters uh one fuel pump about six eight ten batteries i guess been put in the car and um uh one uh uh um  voltage regulator during all this time
 	
 	
 		wow
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's it nothing else been ever done to it except you know the usual filters and this that and the other that you have to put on a
 	
 	
 		that's amazing yeah
 	
 	
 		and doing that it and the uh radiator on it has been rebuilt twice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so the car was how old when you when you bought it
 	
 	
 		well i bought it from a fellow that i knew uh that worked up here it had sixty nine thousand miles on it at that time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he always took good care of it and he bought it just to pull a boat with and when it when it got to be old and uh or older i bought it in seventy seven from him it was about six years old
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i see
 		um-hum um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it had sixty nine thousand miles on it and i had written about synthetic i had read about synthetic oil s in Popular Science so i decided hey this is a good car to experiment on it i don't have much money in it you know i only bought it for a thousand dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i changed it over to uh Mobil One at seventy five thousand miles and i proceeded from then on to never change the oil but every twenty five thousand miles as they say on the can
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh but i
 	
 	
 		yeah oh is it does say that on the can
 	
 	
 		but the oil gets yeah it says that on the can Mobil One cans if you read them says uh uh it it it says as as the automobile manufacturer recommends or twenty five thousand miles what they used to say anyway
 	
 	
 		i didn't realize that uh-huh
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i decided this would do as a good experiment and i had read about this these kinds of synthetic oils in um as i said Popular Science
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		but the oil gets so black that uh at every twelve thousand five hundred miles i do pull the oil filter and change out the oil filter and when you do that you have to add a quart
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but this car uses no oil at all between oil changes i mean not a drop
 	
 	
 		oh i see yeah
 		that's amazing yeah and this is a Maverick you said
 	
 	
 		it's a seventy one Maverick
 	
 	
 		Maverick
 		well i had uh i had owned a Cougar up until oh just several months ago that i had had since uh um i think it was an eighty two or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i had that car only uh about two years and the engine blew in it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i had to put in a new engine that was that's an experience when you have a two year old car you know and it wasn't in warranty then i mean it must have like the day after the warranty was expired it must have exploded
 	
 	
 		uh
 		my goodness
 		what kind of engine was it
 	
 	
 		i have no idea uh V is it V eight i don't i don't know a lot of
 	
 	
 		well they have V eights they have V sixes and they have
 	
 	
 		what's the biggest one is a V eight bigger
 	
 	
 		i guess the V eight
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what it had in it
 	
 	
 		well that's interesting
 	
 	
 		and yeah so it it uh that's my latest experience with something major
 	
 	
 		i guess that's uh uh you uh you must undoubtedly get all kinds of different uh
 		uh engine types or whatever in terms of their durability depending on how they got made but this one here has just lasted and lasted and lasted
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well see that's what i was thinking i thought maybe it has something because that turned me off from American cars i mean  you know something and and i'm sure i shouldn't i shouldn't feel that way that's why i was surprised to hear you talk about this car it sounds very resilient
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		um
 	
 	
 		whatever they have in that engine whatever a kind of engine it is in that car
 	
 	
 		it's just a V eight same as what was in your Cougar probably
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah maybe it has something to do but i i know i took good care of it i changed the oil quite often i didn't even do that myself i i could never do any of this myself
 	
 	
 		you did
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i'm just not uh i'm not uh
 	
 	
 		and it still blew up
 		you're sure nobody ever sugared your gas tank or anything that got mad at you about something
 	
 	
 		yeah and it still blew up
 		well now that yeah not that i know of
 	
 	
 		because i had a van that uh somebody sugared my gas tank and it it tore that engine up and i had to replace it but if it hadn't been for that then uh
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i would've never had any problems
 	
 	
 		you would never have a problem well you know that's possible i never had thought about it but that's my i'm i have a
 	
 	
 		all it takes is a cup full of sugar dumped down your gas tank and it will ruin the engine
 	
 	
 		what what does that do
 	
 	
 		it uh freezes up the rings and everything inside so they can't lubricate sugar does it turns to like a a syrupy like crud
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh okay just like just like sugar would it turns syrupy
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh it it freezes everything up it scalds it scalds the bearings in an engine it essentially just freezes it up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the only thing to do is take it apart and completely rebuild it from bottom out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and generally it ruins the engine to the point where you have to replace it
 	
 	
 		yeah ugh well that maybe that's what happened to it because it had been it had been fine but the odd thing about it was is after i had that engine replaced that car ran hot
 		every summer i mean even though yes Texas is notorious i mean we it's true we have a hundred and eight degree days but you know it uh i had i had trouble with that car after that i don't know if it was just a lemon
 	
 	
 		um
 		um
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		even though it was a brand new engine you know so uh
 	
 	
 		that's amazing
 		might not have been rebuilt properly or they might have put too high a degree thermostat in it
 	
 	
 		yeah course it was a brand new engine supposedly now that's what the dealership told me you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well even if it was if they put the wrong size thermostat in it for the climate you're in it could could make it run hotter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		that's what i i know my i had uh had my dad to finally took it down there because i would take it back and forth and the dealership would not it was i still had the problem it just continued and continued and they would charge me you know two hundred dollars every time they looked at it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um he kept saying the same thing he said it seems like it was your thermostat but at any rate it was really never rectified and i told the people that when i sold it to them i said you know you you might need to watch out but they didn't seem to mind
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they wanted the car so
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you know as far as my ability to do anything on it i can check the oil i know  that's about as far as it goes it's been amazing to watch these guys work on this car i mean you know just from
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		how did y'all come to uh to uh make the seventy three your your collector's item you might say
 	
 	
 		well it just this this gentleman had this car and uh you know he had he had told my fiance that he was going to sell it i mean he just i mean he sold it to us for like three hundred bucks you know and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and we took before we said we'd buy it we uh took it to a Mercedes dealership and they looked at the engine and uh the engine had been rebuilt about uh i think the guy had told us two hundred miles previously or something and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they said it you know the engine alone was worth you know much more than that so we didn't feel like there was any problem
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it's definitely been amazing to to see the transformation we took
 		we took after pictures it's a shame that we didn't take before pictures because yeah it was just uh as i said rusted dents and the color was that dark dark green that's almost
 	
 	
 		no you should've
