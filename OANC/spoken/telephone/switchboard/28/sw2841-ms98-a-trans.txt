 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i have what uh about yourself
 	
 	
 		well uh a few i guess uh
 		i was trying to think  as i was asking you just exactly what movies i had seen recently i i took my wife to see one uh
 		oh my goodness i can't you tell me first because i can't think right now
 	
 	
 		yeah i i should because i've been waiting for a few minutes to talk uh interesting interestingly enough
 		i had the same topic yesterday when i called so i've got my spiel down
 	
 	
 		you mean you had the same topic twice um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh twice in a row second time it's happened to me but uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		let's see last week my wife and i went to see
 		uh Kindergarten Cop
 	
 	
 		oh now that was great we saw that too
 	
 	
 		yeah that was it was it was pretty cool
 	
 	
 		it's the first time i've seen him do a uh a comedy almost type show
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which is kind of a a change for Arnold Schwarzenegger
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah now that was a good show my my wife and i enjoyed that a lot i think the kids did too we didn't go together though
 	
 	
 		oh they went another time though
 	
 	
 		yeah they well i got one runs around i got two boys and one boy runs around with one his group of friends and the other boy runs around with his group of friends i think both of them separately saw it at two different times even with their group of friends
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and then mom and dad went to see it when it went to the dollar and a half movie house
 	
 	
 		yeah well fortunately we have a dollar movie here so i
 	
 	
 		they used to be a dollar here but it finally went up
 	
 	
 		oh i hope doesn't i think they're hedging to but uh i don't want them anyway it was worth uh two bucks for my wife and i to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah it was good show really was uh we went to see uh The King i think it's The King Mary Jo and i did
 	
 	
 		so
 		okay
 	
 	
 		that's the one that uh oh i forget the guy's name that stars with Roseanne on TV
 		oh what's that yeah Goodman and uh that was funny now that was really a good show
 	
 	
 		Goodman
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i mean it wasn't a great show it's just a B movie but it was fun i think uh i think uh you and your wife would enjoy that it's pretty light hearted humor and and and it was uh it was kind of neat kind of cute
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		couple of dollars worth of laughs
 	
 	
 		oh it was definitely worth that it it was worth couple of bucks just to get out and watch that and it was upbeat movie and everything else
 		and uh you know uh eat the popcorn and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's where they make the money is on the popcorn anyway they charge ridiculous prices they charge more for the popcorn than they do for the movie
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		The King huh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's called The King or something like that it's it's uh John Goodman i think it's you know and he's the main star in the whole movie
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and it's got a  a couple pretty good uh supporting actors
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		and uh it's funny it it really is
 		uh you know we uh rather enjoyed trying to think of a couple of others that we went to see that we went to see one movie i can't remember the name of it now though but it was uh
 		oh what was it i can't remember it's just terrible
 		anyway i i long time back uh uh for the benefit at least of the subject we're discussing i went to see Die Hard Two i guess it was Die Die Harder
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that was a scream and you know i thought that was pretty good and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know i can't think of another one other than that at the moment how about you
 	
 	
 		well uh my wife has a problem with uh
 		she can't suspend her disbelief of a movie like she'll sit there and say that won't happen that can't happen there's no way you know so it's kind of hard for me to pick like a uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like if we would go see a Von Dame movie and he runs around the screen for an hour and half just kicking teeth you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		he she'd be like no he he couldn't do that you can't beat up ten guys at once with guns and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so she can't really enjoy it
 	
 	
 		yeah so she can't even enjoy it but i think we're working on her a little bit where she just sits back and takes the movie at what it is
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we've been working uh a couple of friends of myself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh we've been you know we'll go to like uh Segal or we haven't went to Segal yet we're going to and Van Damme and like uh Stallone
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like like the First Blood
 	
 	
 		Stallone just did a comedy incidentally that uh i think's out now
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what the guy told me last night he's like a gangster or something
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'd like to see that
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm kind of looking forward that my wife says there's one she wants me to take her to see this weekend
 		and uh i'm trying it's about a it it it's one that was done a long time ago i think Tony Curtis uh uh uh
 		was uh the star in where the guy dies falls overboard or something and comes back as a woman
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh there's uh uh a movie coming out uh gosh what's the name of that
 		it's already out matter of fact it's been advertised on TV um about a guy that falls over he he gets killed somehow or another and he comes back as a woman
 		and you talk about funny at least the little snapshot previews that they've shown on TV advertising it are hilarious i mean it is really funny
 		and uh so we're going to go see that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now we saw a movie called Sisters
 		what's uh that may have been almost a year ago now i think about it
 		that was quite good
 		i don't know if you've
 	
 	
 		did that have that girl from Cheers in it
 	
 	
 		uh let's see i don't remember whether Cheers no i don't think so you mean Christie
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no i don't think she was in this one i kind was trying to remember exactly who the characters were
 		but uh it was a real touching show about three sisters
 	
 	
 		oh okay this was a comedy so it probably wouldn't be the same one
 	
 	
 		no no this this was a real uh uh sort of serious piece it had some light moments but basically it was a serious piece
 		i thought it was just called Sisters or something like that or the The Sisters or The Three Sisters or something
 		um uh i can't really quite remember and then we saw one uh some time back it's a shame i can't remember the titles of these for the benefit of this conversation although it may not be that the uh necessarily the uh
 		intent but nevertheless that that we saw one here a while back that Dolly Parton and several ladies starred in
 		three or four or five uh three or four women together
 	
 	
 		with old Shirley MacLaine oh yeah i i don't know the name of it either
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and
 		yeah that was pretty good it was okay uh you know most of t his stuff is B movies anyway
 	
 	
 		have you seen Awakenings with Robin Williams
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		i would suggest that it's
 	
 	
 		have you seen that
 	
 	
 		yes i have
 	
 	
 		was it really good i i have heard all kinds of mixed things about it
 	
 	
 		well i'm uh leaning toward medical professions myself so it had some uh
 	
 	
 		are you
 	
 	
 		you know  he was a doctor and it was in a clinical uh
 	
 	
 		psychologist something right um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah psychiatric uh clinical setting so it was interesting
 		to to say the least from that standpoint because it is a true story
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's right i think it was a take off from true story you're right
 	
 	
 		yeah so uh
 	
 	
 		yeah who was the guy he rehabilitated he starred in Taxi or not Taxi uh
 		yeah oh yeah it was Robert DeNiro right
 	
 	
 		was it DeNiro
 		yeah that he just did an incredible job of acting
 	
 	
 		did he
 		well did you ever see speaking of uh of uh medical oriented movie or at least a movie about somebody got rehabilitated did you ever see the one uh that Dustin Hoffman starred in
 	
 	
 		Rain Man
 	
 	
 		yeah now wasn't that a good show
 	
 	
 		yeah now that see if you liked that you would
 	
 	
 		i really enjoyed it
 		oh man i enjoyed that show
 	
 	
 		okay if you liked that um you'd probably
 	
 	
 		my wife and i both enjoyed that
 	
 	
 		yeah you would enjoy Awakenings Awakenings is as touching
 	
 	
 		uh-huh huh
 	
 	
 		but it doesn't have the the language and other things that might detract from the movie
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's it's really it's a movie that wouldn't mind taking my kids to
 	
 	
 		oh i see that's good
 	
 	
 		and i mean it's really clean and but it's it doesn't lose any quality i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think sometimes movies try to spice it up a little bit with things unnecessary uh language or nudity or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but this one here is Awakenings is very clean that was the only thing i didn't like about uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		rain man
 	
 	
 		it sure it makes it true to life and everything but uh you know about Rain Man it was language is harsh every now and then
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah it was cool i'd probably seen it three or four times
 	
 	
 		right yeah that that was uh one that we really enjoyed i was trying to think of uh
 		oh what was that one though
 		it slips me now unfortunately i should have done  thinking about this
 	
 	
 		well it's  you called on the spur of the moment you don't really know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah um
 		oh uh how about any older shows like John Wayne movies and things like you got any favorites along those lines
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh
 		i like most of the old John Wayne westerns uh like El Dorado is that one and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah me too
 		oh yeah yeah
 		i like almost everything he yeah i really love rue Grit
 	
 	
 		yeah True Grit Rooster Cogburn
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah oh man they i thought they were really really fun they were interesting and the one he did with his boys uh Jake Big Jake
 	

 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've seen that on TV several times and that was a lot of fun movie you know i have kind of favorite because i like the uh the musical scores to it matter of fact i had to hunt for years to finally find a copy of the record
 		uh because they made so few of them it wasn't really wasn't all that popular and that was uh uh not was it Hogan's Heroes or
 	
 	
 		yeah that TV show or
 	
 	
 		Kelly's Heroes Kelly Heroes name of the show the one that Clint Eastwood stars in and uh and Carroll O'Connor
 	
 	
 		Kelly's Heroes yeah
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now that's one of my favorite shows i really enjoy i've been trying to tape that one for years and haven't succeeded in doing so yet
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		but i finally did find an album i had to look around several different dealers here in the uh uh Maryland area
 		and put the word out to find the album that had the uh movie score on it that you know they open the show with uh
 		uh a movie score with a score to that
 		and then they wind up at the end playing a tune that is just one of my favorites i've loved it for years and i'm sitting here as i tell you this trying to think of the name of it
 		but uh  it's sung by the Herb Alpert congregation
 		uh the uh the uh  the opening and the closing score of Kelly Heroes the
 	
 	
 		do you remember much about that movie
 	
 	
 		the Kelly's Heroes the movie
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i remember that uh
 		uh their on there way into Germany they make up their own little army you might say they start out small but they get bigger and bigger all the time they bribe this guy well little bribe he's willing to go in on it they've got three tanks that have these huge pipes he puts on the turrets to make
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
