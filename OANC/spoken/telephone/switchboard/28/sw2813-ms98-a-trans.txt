 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well what books do you like
 	
 	
 		um a broad spectrum  my tastes seem to change over the years um
 		i like uh uh  mysteries adventure some science fiction
 		i like uh Sagan i read i read just about everything that he puts out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um Robert  Ludlum
 	
 	
 		great
 	
 	
 		and i've just started uh i got a whole set
 		of books on uh Sherlock Holmes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i'm just getting into that uh that's kind of uh interesting it's unique
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah those are great uh i've been a Sherlock Holmes fan for years and i think i've read most of his stuff multiple numbers of times
 	
 	
 		oh you have
 	
 	
 		uh i just find it very relaxing and very enjoyable and i always hope for my memory to to fail me so after a couple of years i can pick up a story and read it again
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh okay uh i got a whole set i got a set for Christmas
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		so i've just started into some in to him i haven't uh i've uh i think uh they had uh uh
 		Sherlock Holmes uh miniseries on uh  on educational TV
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh channel two up here i'm not sure what it is down there and they had uh uh some of his i i started watching that and i got interested in it so that's why i got the gift
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so you've been doing it for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah i started reading them years and years ago and i it's and i i'm not really much of a mystery
 		reader although i've always liked Sherlock Holmes and then somebody turned me on to a guy named Dick Frances
 		um and he's uh a former jockey and he writes mystery stories and they always involve horse racing in one form or another he's very very good if uh you've never read him
 		that would be a great opportunity
 	
 	
 		no i mean is Dick Frances
 	
 	
 		his name is Dick Frances and any book store owner will know who Dick Frances is
 	
 	
 		um yeah
 	
 	
 		and you can pick up any of his stuff and you can just sort of try it and if you like his style well he's written i'd say twenty or twenty five
 	
 	
 		oh okay yeah um
 	
 	
 		novels you know he's quite quite clever
 	
 	
 		my taste runs runs to uh Ludlum
 		you know that type of
 	
 	
 		uh the adventure stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah adventure yeah uh some of that gets i don't know i think they've got ghost writers now on a lot of them and uh they just put their name to it because years ago either that or my tastes are changing um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they just don't have the same depth that they seem to have before
 	
 	
 		huh yeah you know i always suspected uh uh
 		uh Michener of doing that you know i read some of his early stuff and then it seemed like his later stuff they would be these long long long passages that were just of inferior quality it
 	
 	
 		it was yeah it was uh just to fill a page
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i just got the feeling that he sort of has a coterie of of students and he says okay go write three chapters on this and he and he kind of he might write some stuff i don't think he writes all his stuff every word i may be wrong
 	
 	
 		yeah you're probably right um
 		uh
 		i'm trying to think of that uh
 		Stephen King
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have you read any of his
 	
 	
 		i've read a couple of his things i i just wasn't that crazy about him
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which really puts me in the i know in the vast minority
 	
 	
 		no no no no i've i've read a couple of them that weren't too bad um
 		my oldest boy is into him so he's oh you've got to read this dad you've got to read that dad but i'm not that's not really not my uh cup of tea
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		except the
 		the latest one he's got out uh it's uh
 		fourteen hundred or fifteen hundred page he had he had published it about ten years ago
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and he's got it out now with the with the the full text no cuts and no
 		he he explains that when he did it the first time because of publishing costs they asked they asked him to cut it back a third
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's what he did now he's got it out and
 		i can't even think of the name of it
 		but it's starting out pretty good um it's something that's not
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		like his present style
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 		but other than that um
 		i've read Dune i don't know if you've read Dune
 	
 	
 		i read Dune years ago and i again you you i uh i just did not care for Dune i read through it all it was laborious i i
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		felt i had to get through it and when i put it down i never wanted to read another thing by that guy again
 	
 	
 		to read it again yeah i've read uh i like the original
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Dune and then they had
 		he's had two others after that which i didn't care for at all so i kind of fell off
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but again i realize i mean i all my friends were saying how great Dune was and i just could not
 		could not get into it i read the whole thing but i didn't enjoy didn't enjoy it that much
 	
 	
 		have you read any science fiction at all
 	
 	
 		i really read a lot of science fiction and Asimov is one of my favorite authors
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think his stuff is is great just going back to his very early works and almost anything he writes i try to read
 	
 	
 		uh
 		even i haven't read any of his recent but i've read some of his old uh uh  things and in yeah i i like him he's he's not too bad some of it's
 		uh not him but some of the other science fiction i mean it's just so uh uh
 		like uh Tolkien
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i never could get into him
 	
 	
 		interesting and i was just crazy about Tolkien i read his stuff and i reread it and i read the whole twelve hundred pages aloud to my son when he was uh a young boy when he was about eight or nine
 		we would just read ten pages every night and i just did that you know for a half a year until i'd read the whole thing out loud
 	
 	
 		huh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah my
 		um both my boys are into him but i don't know it's just something i
 		i don't know if i had the time or put myself in the frame of mind for it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		what do you do what do you do for um
 		educational
 		anything
 	
 	
 		well uh uh being a college professor there's just a certain amount of academic reading i do as a matter of course
 	
 	
 		oh so you have to you're forced into it no matter what
 	
 	
 		well well well yeah forced is probably not too strong a word but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		to keep up in your field you usually have to do some uh some technical reading but uh i actually like um
 		for technical reading i like to read what i call uh soft core science like uh Discovery Magazine
 	
 	
 		that's i get that
 	
 	
 		which i like very much and uh
 		and then uh National Science Foundation puts out an excellent publication called Mosaic
 		with uh the and they get some of the best scholars scholars and scientists in the country to write articles that can be understood
 		they're not highly technical but they're not probably not as simplified as in Discovery
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but they're very good except i couldn't i just got on their list somehow because at one time i did some research for them and i'm not really sure how one would go about getting this but it's it's excellent
 		uh
 		for finding out what's going on in fields other than your own
 	
 	
 		yeah have have you ever heard of the Source Book Project
 	
 	
 		i don't believe so
 		Source Book Project
 	
 	
 		uh it deals with anomalies um
 		whether it's uh animal vegetable or mineral or or geologic anomalies
 	
 	
 		oh no no
 	
 	
 		you know like uh  uh rain fish
 		you know that type of thing
 	
 	
 		oh that would be fascinating
 	
 	
 		or the uh
 		the uh is it the Mima mounds in
 		um Kentucky i think
 		or Tennessee
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		what what about them
 	
 	
 		well it's just the Source Book Project  um
 		it gives you a short
 		uh synopsis of of whatever they're talking about and then it gives you all the sources
 		that you can look up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if you're interested in it
 	
 	
 		i see okay that would be a very interesting thing
 	
 	
 		and they they tried to uh
 		uh throw out the uh sensationalism you know like flying saucers and all that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		the things that they that they publish are documented sightings you know and an or
 		digs or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i'm kind of in to that i'm uh uh i belong to the Narragansett Archeology Society so i like going back and you know
 		digging up things it gives me you know uh it's kind of a a thrill to see something that nobody's looked at for two or three thousand years
 	
 	
 		yeah do you have any interest in Stonehenge or did you ever have any
 	
 	
 		uh
 		as far as being uh yes that type of thing yeah that's what these Mima mounds were supposedly like early Stonehenge in America
 		um
 		yeah i'm fascinated with that kind of stuff in fact just recently uh a few days ago
 		they discovered a cave
