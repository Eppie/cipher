 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and
 		how long have you lived there
 	
 	
 		i've lived in this area for about twenty six years
 	
 	
 		okay well you're familiar then very well with what's going on there
 	
 	
 		yes i am
 	
 	
 		we just moved to North Carolina from Oklahoma and i'm not yet familiar we're out in the country a little bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's a contract garbage pickup and it's all thrown together in this area they don't have that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well let me tell you what we have
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		i live in a very progressive county and uh it has we have for the last
 		uh year i suppose had um newspaper pickup but there's always been you know scout troops and that sort of thing interested in doing that because it they get earn a little money and also you know they were helping the environment but the um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the county government then got involved and decided to uh mandate newspaper collection and although they're still we still give ours to the girl scout troop at our church uh they do have curbside pickup in over the entire county for newspapers
 	
 	
 		good
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and then in addition to that they
 	
 	
 		excuse me do you have to bundle it or
 	
 	
 		uh we we can put it in paper bags that's that makes it okay that's that makes it okay um they used to only recycle let you do it uh tied with string
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		but now they do it in paper bags and they do say that it is paying for itself now in the actual municipality of Rockville we moved just outside of it five years ago uh they've been doing newspaper recycling even longer and they were
 		they had their regular um garbage or you know
 		the the social people pick it up on a separate day and they said that was paying for itself It was paying the extra salaries for those people as well as paying you know the city for doing it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well good
 	
 	
 		but the whole county now and it's a large county this is Montgomery County right outside Washington DC um is has begun a program to over a period of the next year to um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		have all well not all waste but um plastics um aluminum and other tin cans and uh glass of all colors
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and it's they they will you will they will also be picked up at the curb and it can be put together at one point and we've been doing it in my family for a while by at first at first we were doing it um
 		separating it because most of the facilities that would take it were uh
 	
 	
 		yes required it yes
 	
 	
 		required it's being separated but they've got this wonderful new facility now that separates it and they had a drawing of it a diagram of it in in one of the local papers and it works um
 		it's like conveyor belts and some of it works by gravity and of course you can imagine the aluminum because it's very light weight
 		um you know falls in one place and the glass goes another place and other and tin that would be picked up by metal is just picked up you know some other way
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um and then the plastic um you know go because it just kind of doesn't fall  i mean i guess it keeps going on the conveyor belt or something i can't remember the the design right now but it's wonderful because you don't have to separate
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that is nice and i've read articles here uh about the confusion involved in what is to be put out and what isn't and the
 		problems that uh some of the recycling centers are having because of the slick magazine pages in with the newspaper which they say ruins the whole batch and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the unacceptable plastics in with the plastics which ruins the whole batch and i just wondered
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well they do try to control that by giving a little instruction
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they do try to say you you know you should have it certain way but um on the the slick newspaper print that comes in with like the Sunday papers and so on
 		they haven't really protested magazines shouldn't be as a rule should not be put in but there are always a few of those pages and they must have a better way to do it now because they they haven't gotten too upset about that
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in general as long as it's the newspaper because there's not you know volume wise maybe it does have to be
 		you know significant volume um percentage before it's a serious problem in the plastics
 		um the the county recycling where we take ours now because we don't yet have the curbside pickup um i
 		the the transfer the you know just solid waste transfer station they uh have indicated they only want the two liter plastic soda bottles and or i guess any soda bottles that are plastic uh caps removed and uh milk cartons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um but in fact there is another facility that will take other items the the you know there are little codes on the bottoms of these things uh for plastic and they look it's a triangle
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		with arrows uh and that indicates it can be recycled but there are different grades of plastic and that's probably what you're talking about sometimes some of those plastics cannot be reused in certain ways
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		some can now even our grocery stores here we have two different large chains that of the plastic bags but you see i'm i have a problem with that i'll take them occasionally but i've decided
 	
 	
 		recollecting the the plastic bags yeah we
 	
 	
 		that i'll take them occasionally but i've decided that i will only take use paper which we are we do get a choice because i know that's biodegradable plastic isn't they can reuse it but it's really not biodegradable
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 		
  
 		right
 		right right
 		well we've had we've been collecting papers here and we uh as new residents we don't have affiliation with uh scout troops and and all that
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		we had a difficult time finding in Charlotte uh a place to finally put them which surprised me and i thought they would be
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yes i am surprised yeah
 	
 	
 		uh located throughout the city and we've
 		called and finally found one
 		fifteen miles away
 		
  
 	
 	
 		oh not very convenient then
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		well what part do you actually live in Charlotte proper
 	
 	
 		no right outside north of uh of Charlotte near the university
 	
 	
 		because my sister lives in Matthews which i think is a little south of Charlotte
 	
 	
 		is south and and east yes right
 	
 	
 		yeah well actually it's called Charlotte now they used to be called Matthews where she lives  they incorporated it but um i i was thinking that you know i i don't know what she does with hers either
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well how active how active are the schools there i'm i'm an old person Linda grew up uh during World War Two and we saved papers and tin foil and string and everything else and uh did it through the school systems and i've wondered
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well it's it's not taken on there as well although the young people i work in the school system so
 	
 	
 		if they're really active
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i teach in in the high school um the uh we have an environmental club which has just begun at our high school this year and i think maybe the young people are becoming more conscious of the need
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um of course it's going to get down to if it's not made easy as i just described the way they're going to do it in this county uh they're making it so easy that you almost can't miss
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh doing it but because you don't have to separate and all that but that seems to be the only way that it'll ever really take off is if it's not too complicated because people in general are just lazy and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in the schools they are trying to make students more conscious
 		and uh but i think the adults are the ones that have to lead the way and they have required the the students in the cafeterias to recycle but of course you know that
 		it doesn't go all the way they they make the effort they try but i think as the younger children come on maybe they'll be a little more conscious of it and eventually
 	
 	
 		that that was sort of my point too in addition to being a a good focal or central collection point it does raise the awareness if you do it through the school system and
 	
 	
 		yes yes it does
 		uh we because they they recycle the styrofoam because that's what most of the uh you know the little trays that they have their dinner you know we used to use those heavy uh plastic or whatever they were metal even trays in in the cafeterias in our schools but but now they have these
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		plastic these Styrofoam ones like they get at McDonald's kind of and um and those are being
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		probably one of the worst things we ever done to ourselves
 	
 	
 		isn't it awful now but do you know that um
 	
 	
 		McDonald's is doing uh-huh right
 	
 	
 		um McDonald's is phasing them out and uh they're supposedly going to try to recycle those that are still left we're talking about
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		two jillion i'm sure
 		so eventful it will take a time but um i i just worry about what's going to happen to the next generation um
 	
 	
 		uh no uh how do you feel about the high schools that you you teach do you feel that they have the right i i get mixed emotions when i see a bunch of uh youngsters throwing things out of the car versus
 	
 	
 		well
 		many of them do
 	
 	
 		they they're talking about environment
 	
 	
 		i know oh but
 		yeah exactly  that does seem a little bizarre um i i find that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		there is a percentage of of uh the student body uh that is a a aware active and interested
 		there is uh a much larger percentage still that it hasn't quite you know taken yet
 		um but i think they're becoming more aware i think what will make the change is um enough of those who are aware and making an effort to do something about it those are going to have to  ridicule
 		those are going to have to  ridicule peer pressure or something
 	
 	
 		right peer pressure is a big one yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah to to kind of make the effort um
 	
 	
 		well i
 		yes i am too i am too well Linda i enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		but i i'm hopeful
 		well i enjoyed talking to you and i wish i wish you luck there in Charlotte
 	
 	
 		thank you uh bye
 		
 
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
