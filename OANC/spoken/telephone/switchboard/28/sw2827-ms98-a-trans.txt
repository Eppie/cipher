 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um do you like to cook
 	
 	
 		well i love to cook as a matter of fact i'm making dinner right now
 	
 	
 		oh really what are you making
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um i um i'm making some uh i have a little turkey left from a passover which which which was in April
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i had frozen it and i'm defrosting that and making some defrosting some gravy and making corn and this wheat pilaf stuff that you can buy at a store which is like uh rice pilaf but we with with with wheat kernel that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and do you cook i mean are you single do you cook every night for yourself
 	
 	
 		no um i'm married and actually the my wife is a vegetarian
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so this isn't for her this is for our friends that came over and helped helped me do some stuff so stuff so he and i and and she's having i i do cook um virtually i cook most of the time because i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh well like if you were having a dinner party what would you cook a variety of things i mean you know vegetarian and nonvegetarian
 	
 	
 		yeah we we consistently if we cook if if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we'll make something you know uh some sort of pasta or something you know homemade pasta or lasagna or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's something that's you know really easy in fact i'm having a dinner party next Saturday and that is what i'm having is pasta
 	
 	
 		oh good idea what
 	
 	
 		well for for Christmas i got a um pasta machine and all all my friends are really anxious you know to have the homemade noodles so um
 	
 	
 		um
 		electric or uh
 	
 	
 		no it's the hand kind old fashion kind
 	
 	
 		best kind that that that that's we we bought one in Italy that's the best kind to have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah i like you know kind of still having in put that not everything's being done for me you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's real good
 	
 	
 		but um yeah so that's what i'm going to be cooking you know i thought i would have like an antipasta um salad first and um then just something for desert you know bread and wine and cheese stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um
 		that would be great have you made pasta before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um so you know so you know that it's a a lot of fun actually
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah a lot of people think though that i've talked to about it think that it's you know a lot of hard work and i said heck it's kind of easy
 	
 	
 		i
 		it actually is if if if you have a food processor i don't know if you have a food processor or not actually it it turns out that if if if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply
 	
 	
 		yeah i do
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then um and with that it it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta by throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up it it it it's just a snap from there and then you get to roll it out yourself
 	
 	
 		right right
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i made yucky i making yucky every now and then as well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's also people think it's real hard it just time consuming to get all of the little things right otherwise it's real simple it's good stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		what other kinds of uh dinner parties  do you serve
 	
 	
 		um well i don't entertain that often uh when i do though i i have some friends that i always  like to experiment on but you know um i see a recipe and think oh wow i'd really like to try this cause i'm single and i live by myself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's not necessarily something that i would cook just for myself
 	
 	
 		right you didn't want to cook
 	
 	
 		so i'll say okay you guys are experimental i want say how this is going to turn out  but  here we go and usually i'm i'm pretty good about it
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		um i have this really good recipe for this um pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing and um you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything and
 		my girlfriend and her husband loved it in fact she passed it on to her parent and
 	
 	
 		huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so it's like it really made the rounds and i was quite impressed with myself if i should say so
 	
 	
 		well that yeah that's the way these things sort of make it is you make it for one person as an experiment and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i usually find it when i make up for the first time i usually doctor it just a little bit you know my own way here and there and it works real well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		well i'm the kind of cook that i don't normally measure things i just kind of throw them in and you know i don't to the point of you know measuring down to the exact amount that they say
 	
 	
 		that means you're a real cook
 	
 	
 		oh is that what it means
 	
 	
 		if you've ever watched the ones on television like uh Jeff Schmidt the super gourmet he he just throws takes stuff he says yeah about an ounce of this  or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's real good yeah we have a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we do uh
 		uh middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually or uh we have people other that have never experienced it before and haven't had much middle eastern food
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		we make uh
 		because we're my wife is Syrian and um her families always have this food she grew up in and i've made some of it before as well so we make uh four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we put them out for people and and that's always a real big kick for people who want you know who've never tried it before
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's that's that's that's a fun idea i mean if you ever uh want something different to try
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i would try that
 	
 	
 		um yeah i've been wanting to take an um oriental cooking class and i just haven't gotten around to it yet
 	
 	
 		oh do you have a wok though yeah those
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i stir fry things on occasion but i'd like to know more about you know more elaborate things i guess
 	
 	
 		i think it's God's gift to cooking
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because it's just quick it's easy um and the food just comes out you know if you do it right i think it comes out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the food comes out very tasty not very mushy you know and and it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we live live in our wok
 	
 	
 		uh-huh really
 	
 	
 		yeah we we we like to eat even when we eat out and stuff we eat a lot of Chinese food or Japanese food or you know Korean or something or Vietnamese or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that seems to so wok food seems to be our thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so anything else you cook
 	
 	
 		um i just kind of you know cook here cook there
 		i don't have any one specialty i mean i'm always willing to try anything usually
 	
 	
 		well that's good that's always the way to do it i think it's the
 	
 	
 		and i i especially like baking and making deserts i've taken a cake decorating class and
 	
 	
 		oh the Wilson course
 	
 	
 		no no actually it was a private course through like a company
 	
 	
 		i like it
 		that's great i haven't the the the thing i really want to do i keep seeing the signs for the the Wilson class
 	
 	
 		it is it's it's neat but it takes a long time you know i mean like i'm elected to always bring cakes into work
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		like for people's birthdays and that and it's like you know
 		you bake the cakes and then i guess just because i don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it like you know some a professional would i try to i go real slow and you know it's a little time consuming but it's really worth your effort once you see how you do
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		yeah oh yeah we have um my brother can do it he's he's uh got a degree in business management so he learned to uh how to do this really well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		can you hold on one second thank you
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 		thank you sorry about that
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 	
 	
 		some one kept beeping in our calling waiting over and over again so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah he he does does that a lot so you know he cooks a lot
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you know he bakes a lot whenever he when when my wife and i got married the night before we had a party or two nights before and he baked us he made a real big cake himself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		did it up and we have a friend who can do for New Years our friend made a baby
 		cake like a baby New York
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it was amazing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i never have can't do anything with cakes so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i get the mold i put i put it on you know the frosting always melts and it's it's just horrible
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you learn helpful hints in the classes at least
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm
 	
 	
 		you know the instructor told us certain things about well don't follow what's really necessarily on the box you know if you're making just a cake from a box you know do this cause you know make it a variety
 	
 	
 		oh that that you mean about the mix itself well that helps
 	
 	
 		you know some different hints
 		yeah
 		some different hints you know and the different things the different kinds of frostings you can make you know and i have a book an it and you know all of the different you know decorating tips an things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well most frostings are sort of butter cream to aren't they
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		those are those kill me it's like it's like i'm eating sugar but they're good sugar
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i suspect that's part of the problem but you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
