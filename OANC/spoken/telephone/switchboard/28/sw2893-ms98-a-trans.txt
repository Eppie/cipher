 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		so
 	
 	
 		okay do you regularly exercise regularly
 	
 	
 		yeah i sure do
 	
 	
 		what do you do
 	
 	
 		uh i ride a bicycle quite a bit and uh work out with free weights
 	
 	
 		okay i love to ride a bicycle
 	
 	
 		i live right near White Rock Lake so i used to i try to ride about ten to twenty miles a day but i
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		haven't been doing so well this year
 	
 	
 		i went an last year i went an was exercising on a bike for a while and i when i'd gotten back i had gotten some sun that day
 		the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel it was the sweating not the burn
 	
 	
 		oh that's weird
 	
 	
 		that was wild but i exercise i don't exercise now i just had a baby three months ago i haven't really gotten back into exercising but i exercised real good for a couple of years it was
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week and it was running three nights a week
 	
 	
 		so what's your motivation
 	
 	
 		what was my motivation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a friend of mine always pushing me this was in Louisiana
 		and she would push you know she was hey let's go do it and you know she wouldn't take no for an answer
 	
 	
 		was it for health or to look good
 	
 	
 		oh i just i just wanted to look good
 	
 	
 		i would think
 	
 	
 		yeah it weren't really health related
 	
 	
 		it was just a side benefit
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah because i'm not um i'm not big or anything but i'm not in great shape so but when i worked out i got in pretty good shape i didn't build up muscle though i just got real good and toned
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't think women look good with muscles
 	
 	
 		up to a point
 	
 	
 		up to a point no more yeah  it's just some of those women that come up there looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		so what was what was the other question let's see do you do it as a task or do you enjoy enjoy working out
 	
 	
 		i guess it's a task because i can't make myself do it lately
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i uh i enjoy it sometimes and there's other times when i just get tired of it and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i feel like i'm obligated to do it because i've been doing it so i should keep up
 	
 	
 		you don't want to lose yourself
 	
 	
 		and there's some days it's just like it's the hardest thing in the world to
 		to get started
 	
 	
 		well how old are you
 	
 	
 		i'm uh twenty seven
 	
 	
 		okay so you're still young
 	
 	
 		yeah still young getting older
 	
 	
 		we all are so
 	
 	
 		yep
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's not hard to stay well if you keep working out when you're young though when you get older you know your body's not going to look as bad i seen an old woman today
 		she was about eighty and she looked so good i mean she was standing just as straight and tall and she had a small waist and she didn't have you know like you know how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and she didn't have that at all she her lips were a little bit wide but a lot of back in her time they liked women with big hips anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so she may be keeping that on purpose so
 	
 	
 		yeah i notice if you uh
 		if you stay in shape you don't age as bad
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think too i was
 		i go to school too at night and last semester i
 		had stopped working out because i hurt myself and started smoking a lot and you just those kind of things age you more
 	
 	
 		well smoking ages you quick it puts those little wrinkles around your lips
 	
 	
 		right and
 		right and you can't and then you know it just kind of feeds itself you smoke and then you don't work out because you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you get winded
 	
 	
 		yeah right and so i
 	
 	
 		oh i smoke a pack a day and
 	
 	
 		i finally quit because like i just all i was doing was going down hill fast
 	
 	
 		oh
 		and i can't quit smoking i've tried i was telling a friend of mine that be
 		almost almost as bad as being an alcoholic can't quit smoking
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've tried i just can't do it i quit when i was pregnant with my kids but you know as soon as i had them right back to it
 	
 	
 		right back to them yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it was like you know that was the only reason i quit i didn't want to
 		and i don't want to quit smoking i enjoy that i said i have very few vices i'll keep this one thank you  but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		did you ever go to like one of those health clubs or anything
 	
 	
 		i went to a health club a few years ago and now i work out at home because i don't really my schedule with school and work i don't have time to get down to one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there used to be one that was a twenty four hour that i used to go to but uh i actually prefer to work out alone
 	
 	
 		i like to work out with people i need like you i i need competition is what i need i've got to have somebody to compete with or i don't want to do anything
 	
 	
 		really
 		yeah
 		i wouldn't mind having you know working out with a friend and
 		and stuff but when you get into some of these some of these health clubs where you just stand around and wait
 	
 	
 		um-hum are you
 	
 	
 		you know i like to start get it done and get out of there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh are you married or anything no
 	
 	
 		no i'm not
 	
 	
 		well get your girlfriend to work out with you a lot of women like that i'd love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him he doesn't work out very often course he don't need to he's
 		small and he works as a laborer on the railroad so you know he's building his muscles up all day he doesn't have to do anything he can eat like a horse too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and he don't you know he don't gain it like i do but uh
 	
 	
 		uh especially having a kid i guess tends to just gain weight because you have to to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you have to well you can gain too much weight i gained a little bit too much but i looked
 	
 	
 		to uh
 	
 	
 		with my first little boy i did gain a lot of weight i got i got about fifty pounds overweight with him and i didn't loose it until two years ago and then i got pregnant and you know ruined that  so
 	
 	
 		set to start all over
 	
 	
 		yeah well actually like i say it ain't as bad this time because i was in shape when i got pregnant
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i wasn't out of shape i wasn't overweight with when i got pregnant with him i just wasn't in in shape i don't know the difference but
 	
 	
 		yeah some people are a little bit fanatical about it you know i
 	
 	
 		about weight
 	
 	
 		well yeah and about
 	
 	
 		exercise
 	
 	
 		working out and fitness you know i like to to work out to look good and stay in shape and you know i know it's good for me but
 		people that live for it and you know eat a bunch of different pills and
 	
 	
 		wel l that's what my friend did
 	
 	
 		all that kind of stuff it gets a little bit
 	
 	
 		well she was she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else and really we was you know even with her taking all those expensive expensive vitamins and stuff
 	
 	
 		obsessive
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we stayed right on the same track with each other you know developing and everything now there you can take those uh what is it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		steroids
 	
 	
 		steroids yeah i couldn't think i was going i was trying to say hemorrhoids  no i was trying to say hem hormones yeah hormones but yeah uh steroids but i stay from that crap
 	
 	
 		yeah there's really bad for you
 		hem hormones
 		yeah it's too dangerous
 	
 	
 		oh i wouldn't  i could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah i had a friend whose brother did steroids and
 		as soon as he stopped working out he just
 		ballooned out it all turned to fat and it just
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		really looked bad
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i didn't know it did that
 	
 	
 		i don't know if it does to everybody he was
 		it it just that's how it affected him and he i don't know just
 	
 	
 		yeah but i've been wanting to get me a bicycle or a bike i've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around i'm scared to run for dogs course i know dogs can get you on a bike too but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		seems like it
 	
 	
 		at least you got a chance to outrun them that way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't like to run myself i've thought about it several times and i just it i like to move a little faster and cover more ground
 	
 	
 		well they yeah they've come up that  running is not as good for you as they thought it was
 	
 	
 		it's probably i would think it would be hard on your your legs and your joints and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah it's real hard on your legs and it's hard on women
 		and it it just makes stuff move down and uh but i i i like jogging i don't mind that i can get out and do that as long as it's not hot if it's hot you can't do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh i can't
 	
 	
 		but in the rain oh i love to run in the rain just you know be careful not to slide
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you can't ride your bike at all in the rain can you
 	
 	
 		no you can't
 	
 	
 		you slide
 	
 	
 		it's dangerous
 		at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you slide all over the place
 	
 	
 		yeah oh i when i did ride my friends bike that one time i had uh i don't know what i was trying to do i was trying to make a U turn and i never could make a U turn in a bike i can do it in my car
 		but i tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked and i told her a dog was chasing me  but i wrecked it into the curb i didn't hurt it too bad i scratched it on the the
 		oh she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire i think but oh well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway it's been nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		good luck with the the new kid
 	
 	
 		thank you  she's it she's good anyway have fun exercising all right bye-bye
