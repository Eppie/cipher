 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right Clarice uh what's your favorite basketball team
 	
 	
 		well Mavericks probably the one that plays here
 	
 	
 		the Mavericks yeah
 	
 	
 		the Mavericks uh they're not doing the greatest that i've seen them play before but uh well they're doing okay
 	
 	
 		yeah they didn't quite make the play-offs though
 	
 	
 		but but
 		no no i i think without uh Roy Tarpley they're he he added something to the team but uh i think they need to let him go maybe
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he doesn't seem to course i have a lot of players that i think are really super i think Isaiah Thomas is just great and uh i think uh he
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he does really well i like to watch him play he just has a really good moves and uh  i don't know i i guess uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i guess i like to watch the Mailman play for the the Utah team uh when he delivers he does okay and uh uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i can't think of the name of the team that has Larry Bird on it oh the Celtics i like to watch them play the whole team i like their whole team
 	
 	
 		oh the Celtics
 		the they are a team is what's really good about them
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		they just uh work the ball and uh pass around and make each other look good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum i you know like i said i like Isaiah Thomas but i think sometimes that uh
 		that uh he he sometimes ends up being a one man team uh whereas the Celtics like you said they play more as a team um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		makes it little more fun to watch at times
 	
 	
 		yeah i like Michael Jordan a lot too he's really good uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		Danny Ainge he plays i like Danny Ainge okay
 	
 	
 		you like Danny Ainge
 		why do you like Danny Ainge that that's i mean you've named like four of the top names in the game and then you come up with Danny Ainge
 	
 	
 		well i
 		well i guess because he played at at my alma mater  so i i kind of watch him every now and again
 	
 	
 		did he play BYU oh you went to BYU huh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah and he played really well when he was there so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it's it's hard to uh name him with some of the very top players i think sometimes but i'm glad he's playing in the in the pros yeah he's a
 	
 	
 		yeah he's uh well i have nothing against him i just uh
 	
 	
 		you just wondered why i named him huh
 	
 	
 		i wondered yeah i wondered everybody has their their favorite you know maybe not the the big name player but uh
 		yeah he's playing a vital role he he's playing for Portland he's playing for Portland he's i mean he's coming in and doing a good job he's it was a great trade how they got him
 	
 	
 		Portland um-hum right now
 		yeah they yeah i i liked when he uh he was playing with Celtics and then he traded to Portland
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it was a good trade so
 	
 	
 		seems like uh
 		i don't know if it's mainly because of him but it seems that he plays for top teams
 		and uh you know contenders uh he might have uh did he go straight from Boston to Portland or did he hit another team on the way
 	
 	
 		um
 		i don't remember i really don't it seems like he went straight there you know because i don't remember him playing for another another team other than straight through
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah he's uh i i like to watch him play because he's a yeah he's pretty tough you know he's he's a scrappy guy
 	
 	
 		so what's your favorite team
 	
 	
 		he's a competitor
 	
 	
 		do you have a favorite team yeah
 	
 	
 		oh do i have a favorite team uh well i'm from Indiana so i like the Pacers and uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i like Larry Bird because he's from the home state also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i just likewatch him play anyway uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		let's see i like the Bulls because they're from the Chicago area and uh they've uh suffered through many a hard season before they got Jordan
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh even then once they got him they didn't make the play-offs for a couple years they had to gradually build up a supporting cast because you can't just win with one player in the NBA you have to have a a you know a good solid team
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		even though one player can carry a bulk of the of the scoring load you know you have to have the other players there to complement him and finally with uh Pippen and some of the Horace Grant some of the other guys are coming right along
 	
 	
 		i watched uh well i didn't watch them but i i saw in the newspaper and in on the news the play-off teams and
 		and without Larry Bird and and Michael Jordan when they got injured you know it was interesting i think then how their teams did um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how it it it brought the scoring down a little bit but their teams stayed relatively together you know and so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i think sometimes it's interesting we we really watch the big name players and but they have to have a solid team underneath or else they really don't don't go anywhere
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i i think that's kind of the Mavericks problem they have okay players but sometimes the strongness of the team isn't together
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know every once in a while they click during a a game and then it works for them but then it's just not always there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i i guess that's
 	
 	
 		well they made a couple trades this this year that uh well Fat Lever was hurt most of the year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that so they didn't get to reap any benefits from that and uh i don't know how well Alex English did but
 	
 	
 		English did okay he did okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		see see we don't have a TV so i didn't get to watch any of the Mavericks i think i got to watch probably one game all year so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i think Adubato as the coach of their team uh has done a lot a lot for them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think he he's uh brought some strength to that team um
 		um he he's really trying hard he's a nice guy i like him as the coach of the Mavericks so
 		i don't i don't know a lot of coaches in the in the NBA though
 	
 	
 		well they move around so much
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		can't hardly keep a one coach where he's at for very long enough to get know who he is
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true  that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah i think uh like you said i mean Tarpley if he was had his life straightened up he could really help a ball club but you know the way well he's operating now he's more of a detriment than anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think they're i think they'll let him go
 	
 	
 		they should
 	
 	
 		anyway i i uh i like basketball it's a fun sport i i like to watch it i like to um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i guess i like it because of of the quickness of it um and and i like it because it takes the players
 		have to be
 		you know it's not a game where you can just not practice i mean they have to be on the top of their game to be i n the NBA i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah or else
 	
 	
 		top physical condition too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so do you like college basketball high school ball anything like that
 	
 	
 		i don't watch much of that i watch our town Plano uh Plano East is where my children will go i have an eleven year old son and he plays basketball and my son my husband coaches his team
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they uh i think they were one off one loss to the play-off
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh i like to watch our Plano East Senior High boys play they are they did really well so yeah
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		i like yeah i do like um the the games not only basketball but the other ones too that the high schools play i keep up with that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah i i it's fun watching basketball at all different levels i mean there are benefits and and
 		bad points of watching it each each different one i mean you may not see a spectacular Michael Jordanish move from a high school player but you know it's more of an accomplishment if if they hit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know some three pointers or something the game is you know it's just a different game pretty much but that's sort of what makes it fun
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well you know what i think is you know like Spud Webb i mean
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you can really even if you're short like that you know in basketball today they get these huge tall players that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that just are you know if you want to do it bad enough i think it's a possibility in anybody's life
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he's he really goes for it and he's a good little player you know so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah he's
 	
 	
 		i think if if any of these boys want to do it they really can if that's really their dream
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so  takes work though that's the big yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		takes a lot of working
 		well Spud was just gifted with a exceptional vertical leap and that's what helps him out more than anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		plus you know he's like you said he's worked hard at it i'm sure
 	
 	
 		well
 		i just think that basketball's a fun game and and i guess i still have to stick with the Mavericks i guess as far as
 	
 	
 		yeah
