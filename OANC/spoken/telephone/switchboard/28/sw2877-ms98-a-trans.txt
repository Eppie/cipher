 		Joey the the dog is Joey
 	
 	
 		uh-huh he's the little boy Pomeranian
 	
 	
 		the cat is
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and we just got a new addition to the family so to speak we also have a fish
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		it's a mud dog
 	
 	
 		i beg your pardon
 	
 	
 		it's a mud dog it's uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		a cross between a catfish and uh i don't know what a salamander
 	
 	
 		well did you all catch it or uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we have a cat Stripper
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh the mud dog
 	
 	
 		no did no did you catch the fish
 	
 	
 		uh we had a friend give it to us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and it's all alone in that aquarium
 	
 	
 		yeah we'd like to get him a friend but um uh we haven't found one yet so how about you do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		well at the present time i have two dogs
 	
 	
 		oh really what kind
 	
 	
 		an English setter you know that's the white dog with the feathers and it has
 		uh yellow spots on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which they call i think uh liver spots
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's a male and i have a wonderful female lab black lab
 	
 	
 		uh-huh how long have you had them
 	
 	
 		quite a long time uh
 		probably five or six years and unfortunately the black lab that's a female it that it's it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had an i when she was about three years old
 		we noticed that she was having problems uh problems limping and so forth and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she has hip dysplasia
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		and it's in that breed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but now i think there are tests that can be conducted uh
 		to
 		tell whether or not
 		the puppies have the have it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i think i don't know apparently they've been so in well i don't know inbred or what but
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		well no i'm not sure that's the situation but it um for those dogs that are registered and if if you should have one
 		uh that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it uh
 	
 	
 		huh i had no idea i hadn't didn't even know that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but she's wonderful
 	
 	
 		um our dog Joey has uh a back problem
 	
 	
 		um like have
 	
 	
 		uh he he's got a bad back
 		but he's seven uh i guess he's about almost eight years old
 	
 	
 		what are the
 		what are the symptoms
 	
 	
 		um he just uh he doesn't
 		he uh you he rolls over he doesn't like to roll over
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um even you just when you touch him a certain way on the back
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but otherwise he can jump uh you know just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way
 	
 	
 		um
 		well uh i have had just wonderful luck with this lab uh
 		when i uh let's see winter before last
 		we would bring her in and uh when it was cold
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she wouldn't i you know the next morning you want to take them out
 		and she wouldn't i couldn't get her up without
 		picking picking her up and which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds
 	
 	
 		i bet
 	
 	
 		um until if i allowed her to not get up on her own it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		anyway i uh met my son's uh college roommate is a vet
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he said um let's give her some race horse shots
 		and you know in i'm i'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this but you because you all the time you know run into people with problems
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway that's when we lived in Oklahoma and uh
 		so he gave this dog a series of  it's they give it to race horses uh to get rid of uh cartilage
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's called  anyway it's a series of six shots once a week and then i noticed after two shots she was
 	
 	
 		do you have to give those
 	
 	
 		well i could have but i can't give a shot
 	
 	
 		oh i believe me i understand
 	
 	
 		i took her from Enid Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six weeks
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		and uh after the the second shot she was significantly better then i didn't notice any improvement till the after the sixth one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and ever since and he said uh a booster uh every year or two
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean maybe every six months or or something like that and when i notice in the winter when it's worse you know it's cold weather and so forth
 		then i have uh gotten a booster for her but not many people in this part of the country know anything about
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i've had to get it from Oklahoma they've heard about it but they've really never used it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i've never heard anything about it either
 	
 	
 		so dogs that get down in the hips like i think German Shepherds do it and probably large dogs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's just wonderful
 	
 	
 		does he get is he an inside dog also or does he just run out in the backyard is he fenced in
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um um well we're living now in an area where we we we're in the woods and we take walks i just don't let them
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh uh go away from me but we take walks through the woods twice a day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		and uh i can over do it on her
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but anyway at least she can go and she's not limping along and all that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		tell me about your cat
 	
 	
 		oh Stripper well he started out being a little orphan and we we took him in and uh
 		he's about two years old now and he loves his treats uh both uh Joey and uh Stripper get treats
 		and uh let's see
 	
 	
 		and is um Stripper an inside cat or outside
 	
 	
 		o h well he's outside and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he's got a way to get in he's got free access of a window we like to keep open
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to
 	
 	
 		well of course  that's nice they they
 	
 	
 		
 
 		Joey on the other hand is a little different he has to go out whenever uh we ask him and when he when we ask him
 		he uh he barks he'll either bark for food or he'll bark to go out and he'll tell you which one he wants
 	
 	
 		well he's been
 	
 	
 		he's been through obedience school
 	
 	
 		well he has been trained and you've keep you've kept up it up haven't you
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 	
 	
 		yeah it is wonderful i i have some neighbors across the field and um
 		they when we first moved here uh when the dogs and i didn't feed we have a very nice kennel and everything but but since i i didn't want to i was i just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i kept watch and never let them get away but now every couple weeks they would one would slip away and my neighbor said
 		to me oh i noticed those dogs dogs are so well trained anytime they hear your voice they come so that made me very proud
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		well have we been talking five minutes
 	
 	
 		i'm not for sure
 	
 	
 		i'm not either but
 	
 	
 		i think maybe we have but
 	
 	
 		yeah well um so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 		have you ever done this before
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		oh okay um i haven't ever called i've put in the paper work i just never made the call
 	
 	
 		oh really uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah so i didn't know if they stop you when the time is up or
 	
 	
 		no they don't no i i glanced at the clock when um we started and i think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something but one day i was talking to a lady about gardening and i'm i love gardening and she did too an and after
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		after about twelve minutes or something the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh  well at least you know you did your part
 	
 	
 		uh-huh but it's been so much fun too uh talk
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how did you get into this
 	
 	
 		well my best friend in Virginia's daughter is a part of this project in Texas
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and so she knew that i had the time and would be would enjoy it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's true
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i mean i
 	
 	
 		so but i have a hard time getting anybody because i guess do you work
 	
 	
 		um yes i do
 	
 	
 		yeah and probably just got home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um during the day i mean i think and i understand also they want men
 	
 	
 		right i was going to tell you the same thing they're really looking for a lot more men to participate
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband does
 	
 	
 		does he yeah i need to i've got some applications i need to hand them out but uh this is a great project that they're working on and it's really going to lead the way uh for a lot of economics um applications and and
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		development in the voice area
 	
 	
 		yes when i think so too and i haven't helped them out on the men on men particularly but my husband had been made in fact he's been
 		probably has made a few more calls than i have because i tend to not make them around dinner time i try to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know make them do during the day but nobody's home
 	
 	
 		well this is the perfect time for me
 		well maybe i'll get you next time
 	
 	
 		well good
 		yeah it so fun much fun to talk to you
 	
 	
 		all right have a good one
