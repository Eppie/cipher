 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay cars you you maybe this is a fantasy we can to talk about any kind of car we want here
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac
 	
 	
 		hey that sounds like a great deal to me  you have great aspirations  well let's see i we just bought uh a seventy three Mercedes that we have restored
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's great your husband uh i'm i'm a hobbyist too i like to work on cars too
 	
 	
 		and it
 		yeah it has really been a lot of fun uh we found some guys that actually you know worked for a Mercedes dealership and uh they also repair them for other the people on their off time
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		so have we we have redone that thing from stem to stern i mean inside outside you know we've redone the body repainted it detailed it so you know i really haven't thought
 		much past that it seems like you know i don't know if i'll ever want another new car again you know
 	
 	
 		was you why they they didn't say buy it they didn't necessarily say buy it new they just said what would you buy you know
 	
 	
 		maybe not
 		yeah that's true i i don't know it just seems like uh you know for what we've put into it i feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more than you know yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh sure a restored vehicle is is great i think certainly if it's an old Mercedes will be good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right we the one thing that uh we did decide as it's it's we wanted it to be as authentic as possible but
 		we did break down and put a CD player in it  that's not quite authentic but at any rate that that was one thing that i one of the features that i did want
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		i'd passed up on one and put a sunroof in it i had to stop there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you all you all done a lot more when i talk about working on cars i sure don't do that
 	
 	
 		yeah well of course we do it ourselves but like i said we were just lucky to find these guys that do it you know they're they just weren't really expensive and
 	
 	
 		oh okay okay
 		oh that is good to have uh knowledgeable people
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah you know right and they work on it so the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and and work on it or work on it so
 	
 	
 		that's amazing
 	
 	
 		yeah it's you know it's really it's really been nice we uh
 	
 	
 		i i do all my own work uh so i i have Chevies mostly well that's all i've got right now i've got three Chevy V Eights i'm uh i'm uh a Chevy i'm an American car person but i do like Mercedes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah
 		you're an American car person yeah yeah i i have always had an American American car and uh i had a real real bad experience with the Cougar that i had it was an eighty two Cougar
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i don't know i think it just soured me on it for some reason because i had trouble with it starting the engine blew up  in it i had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i i thought what the heck you know we'll try something different so
 	
 	
 		well i'm not a Ford person and never have been as a kid and uh i do like the V Eight engines and i think the the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i went to the auto show with my daughter hear recently down in Dallas and i to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling engines right now i mean i'm not saying that they were a couple of years ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		really
 		yeah right yeah yeah i would that that there's i see a marked improvement you know you know as far as uh what i've heard about performance and such
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so uh uh hopefully it'll stay that way i mean you know i'd i'd i would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know even though right now i'm not driving an American car but uh i think
 	
 	
 		i uh you know they said they said what do we want to buy i i'm uh seriously not seriously thinking but i i would like to put it in that category uh buy a Cadillac but i wouldn't buy a new one and you know of course if i had the money i'd be happy to by a new one but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i do look for a one year old vehicle you know with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah twenty thousand yeah yeah well that's what my parents are avid Cadillac freaks they had uh and i think my my mother drives the SeVille now that's uh i guess it's a couple of years old
 		and uh she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was sort of
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i remember those yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and she it final just wore out they had they had purchased it i don't can't remember how many years they had that car but she loved the styling of it
 	
 	
 		that she may want to save if she she doesn't have it anymore
 	
 	
 		no she sold it and she
 	
 	
 		that since they don't make them anymore she that could be turned into a classic in in ten fifteen years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know
 		yeah she kept telling herself that and it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because
 		my dad said well just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it i mean he came back with a new car  yeah i think he had an ulterior motive he could just see you know dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went but uh
 	
 	
 		no he wanted new one yeah right yeah
 	
 	
 		they they really are nice cars there there
 	
 	
 		i i'm still a full size person and i like a full size Cadillac i i want one of those i think they are i don't know a classic but they're certainly not they haven't changed in about uh twenty years and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and they'll eventually phase them out uh and i sure would like one ever those uh
 		uh within the next five years or so
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again you know they had
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they've scaled everything down so much and uh i have i don't i've never owned a really large car i don't know i think that Cougar was the biggest thing i ever had and
 	
 	
 		well even the Japanese cars are bigger too but uh i've never had a Japanese
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah now the Lexus are very nice looking cars you know
 	
 	
 		i've never had a Japanese car i i've had friends who had them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think they're a lot over rate and their's no styling to them that you can't tell one Japanese car from the other they all look alike you know i don't mean that as a joke i mean they really all look alike and the adds i don't have any idea what which car it is
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		what is what yeah uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		until i look at it to see what it is and i think they have not uh lead the field in styling they do have nice sports cars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the price is way more you can get a Cadillac for the same price as you can get a small Japanese car it's ridiculous now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah i know that uh i've i've sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike  you know i guess it just uh there seems to me they're all the same shape i have a very good friend that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		has a Buick Regal and she she's had she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it and that's what she's going to buy again and i'm like oh please it looks exactly the same as this old one that you've got and so i guess it's in the eyes of the beholder i suppose
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah yeah well if if you're interested you  to go to the next auto show i i look at the Cadillacs and boy there were some Cadillacs that i didn't even realize they made but they were just styled so differently
 	
 	
 		really
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they were standard Cadillacs but they really looked beautiful
 	
 	
 		are they still are what they're what they have out for like the next year is everything still pretty square it seems like the Cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really i i can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the
 	
 	
 		oh no they have they have convertibles now in the Cadillac field and they have that new uh it's not the big uh Fleetwood the one i want which is the same in the last twenty years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there's another one that has came out in the last few year it's not the Seville the Seville is totally different no the auto show they had fantastic looking cars so uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		now when when was this when this was this recently
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it was a month or so ago
 	
 	
 		oh okay because i have a
 	
 	
 		well they have it every year
 	
 	
 		yeah usually when i see the new cars it's during the fair when i go to the auto building at the State Fair and that's usually when i see anything you know
 	
 	
 		right now this was uh in it was downtown
 		in the uh Convention Center they had all the cars they had certainly had Japanese and German cars they had the full range and they had some they had some new cars that weren't even out they had a uh
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		new Chevy Suburban truck you know that big big one that was uh they didn't have a price on it nor did they know had a it would cost it had a microwave in it and everything it was they had several futuristic cars
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 		oh my word
 		that's wild you know you you hear about things like that and you think that can't possibly be done i mean it just that's just too weird
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know
 		and i like engines they had a lot of broken down engine not broken down i mean you know cut uh displayed engines you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right uh-huh so you could tell the what see the inside of them or whatever yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah but uh that that sold me in buying a new car you know i mean certainly interested in buying a new car but again the yeah the American cars were for superior in styling and new engines
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah hum well maybe somebody's finally woken up you know
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i think so because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while and i think that i i would definitely buy again there's the question are we in the market uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i could buy anything you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you know i could fine i i was really crazy about Jags for a while and the convertible what is it XJS or something like that
 		and i you know thought that's a dream car and and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant you know i
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well i work on them myself so i don't that you know my cars don't go to the shop you know so uh i am a mechanical engineer and i've always done it myself and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well that's good that you can
 	
 	
 		i've got three of them and uh i can't remember one i think i had one someone welded a muffler on for me in a years time i think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that i've in it just the welding on like i said i don't do that you know
 	
 	
 		oh really that oh gosh that's great
 		i think it takes a talent to do that you know my my husband is uh engineer but he cannot i mean i or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it that's might be part of it but uh
 		you know we just i just say forget it we'll just take it in and have it taken care of he drives drives a Honda
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i noticed that when i was a kid uh i was wasn't a mechanical engineer but i worked my way through college as a mechanic so i learned early from fifteen on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and dropped it for a long time when after i got out of college and then picked it up again later on and now again i've got three vehicles and i i don't i never  and they just don't go to the shop at all you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		well that's to  that's one thing that when you would consider see when i go out to think about a new car or buy another car i don't think about well is this engine that i can work on or that you know my husband can work on or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know so you're you're pretty lucky in that respect that
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm keeping V eight V eight Chevy engines because that's what i know and in fact i stock the same part i'm like a little stock if you brought your Chevy to me i could i'd probably have some parts for it right now you knows
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's what you know yeah
 		um-hum
 		that's pretty good it's really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car and when i say we have redone everything i mean we have redone everything and it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's great i've always wanted to that too
 	
 	
 		it's really been so interesting the people you meet because uh my husband Carl has called all over the country you know he's gotten these catalogs trying it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts than you might think this is for a seventy three
 	
 	
 		oh i can imagine
