 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		what uh what baseball teams do you follow
 	
 	
 		i follow i've been a long time Cincinnati Reds fan because when i was growing up and i was five years old i wanted to be a catcher so i was a big Johnny Bench fan
 		so i was a big Johnny Bench fan so i've been through the Reds with the Reds since you know nineteen seventy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i remember the Seventy World Series like i said i was only five years old then but i had to give a report to my dad every because that was when they played World Series games in the afternoons sometimes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		i've kind of gotten away from them until the last couple of years because i didn't really know many players and their team but i also being from the Indiana area i like the Cubs and the White Sox
 		so i kind of follow those two teams
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a little bit and you know since moving down here the Rangers you know i've been picking up on them a little bit
 		and uh
 		it looks like they could do all right this year and uh of course they're in there with the right White Sox i believe and they're in their division so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the White Sox headed for probably another good year i hope what about yourself
 	
 	
 		oh i guess mainly the the Rangers such as they are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they do seem to have a pretty tough division though with Oakland and Kansas City and White Sox all uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		jammed in there
 	
 	
 		yeah do you go to a lot of games
 	
 	
 		oh i get to i don't know quite a few in the summer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's i've been looking forward to it i've only been to one game
 		and i just moved down here at the end of last summer so that last season was winding down so i'm hopefully i'll uh get to a couple this year i want to see Nolan pitch one time
 		that that's be that'd be really neat
 	
 	
 		yeah it looked like they're starting off kind of shaky but they they've gone i guess over five hundred now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i was hoping that no hitter that he threw would would get them fired up a little bit
 	
 	
 		it might
 	
 	
 		but it's hard hard to tell
 	
 	
 		did they uh play today
 	
 	
 		uh i was trying to think they were up in a stand at Detroit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know if they're playing today or not
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right that's right
 		yeah i watched a little bit of the i was flipping back and forth between the the Pacers and the Celtics and uh the White Sox game
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that was on today
 		i i just like i like the White Sox i've never really got into them and then this friend of mine was just a hard core White Sox so he took me to a game and you know i think they're you know they're really neat because they're such a young team
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		actually the youngest team in baseball and they got some
 		you know the last three or four years their number one picks you know they're all suited up and playing for them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the draft and uh
 		you got to like that you know building the team through draft picks and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah it says a lot for their future
 	
 	
 		yeah it does hopefully some of their players will come through and they got Tim Raines a veteran and they got Carlton Fisk he's you know still pretty solid a lot of experience
 		but uh
 		uh you like the Astros or anything like that
 	
 	
 		oh i don't really follow them a whole lot um i i hear about them occasionally i've got a friend whose a a trainer for one of their farm clubs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think so  we hear off and on about them they've never really done a whole lot i mean they're up and down kind of like the Rangers are  most of the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well when was the last time the Rangers really did well
 	
 	
 		it's been probably three or four years since they were i think they finished second in their division i don't remember what they ended up last year third or fourth i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so they were contenders till about three or fours years ago
 	
 	
 		yeah they have been off and on uh maybe maybe three or four times since they've been here
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i never really followed them all i knew uh
 		kind of watched them a little bit in the seventies there again you know cause i was a little catcher in baseball i liked to watch a Jim Sundberg and uh like Jeff Burroughs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh forget who else used to play for them but uh yeah those guys were were really tough
 	
 	
 		well they've been like a lot of teams and the minute they do real badly in the past they just got got rid of their manager this is Valentine's the first manager they've had in on you know any kind of length of time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so hopefully he'll eventually put something together
 	
 	
 		you think he's pretty good
 	
 	
 		i i can't  i don't know uh sometimes i think he is and sometimes i wonder
 	
 	
 		yeah i was watching the game yesterday and they had had bases loaded
 		and they tried a uh a squeeze play
 		and uh i just couldn't understand that i forget whose who was batting and but uh
 		i don't know i just
 		i couldn't understand that move there was only one out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's like you know give the guy a cut you know you got bases loaded you know one mistake cause a lot of these players aren't used to bunting that much and it's a easy double play
 	
 	
 		yeah true
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		i guess i was feeling pretty confident about the team Valentine this year until uh he got mad at Pete Incaviglia and just cut him for because he was upset at him
 	
 	
 		you didn't like that move
 	
 	
 		well i i can understand his point i thought it was kind of childish to just cut him instead of trying to trade him because then Detroit picks him up
 		and he started out real good for them and he he's gotten kind of shaky now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think they should have at least gotten something for him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's true
 		what about uh
 		Sierra you a big Ruben Sierra fan
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he's been around what four or five years
 	
 	
 		i think so yeah
 	
 	
 		you think you can see him staying there for awhile or
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i think as long as he produces he and Franco they they run kind of hot and cold too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think Franco hit a home run was it last night to win the game
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i'd i turned the game on i don't know who won
 	
 	
 		i think they won six to five and i think that was on his he hit a home run at the end and broke the tie up
 	
 	
 		well good
 		yeah i'm kind of into baseball cards so uh
 		last year i was buying a lot of Juan Gonzalez cards
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		so i'm hoping he's going to blossom and make me a rich man someday
 	
 	
 		yeah  that'd be nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i think the Rangers have the the pitching staff they need if they would just produce some offense they might do all right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i'm definitely looking forward to going to a few games this summer that's good entertainment at a budget price
 	
 	
 		yeah you said you were a Cincinnati fan has uh all this brouhah a with Pete Rose over the years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		caused caused you any distaste for them or
 	
 	
 		no you mean like
 		no
 		i mean
 		thing about rose i mean you know that he's got a problem in his personal life i just
 		you know he he messed up but i still think he's belongs in the Hall of Fame and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you know he played for so many so well for so many years that
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh it's just too bad it's you know like the players that do drugs or do you know are alcoholics they just have a problem
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's too bad it carried over and has hurt his image and everything else
 	
 	
 		well but it didn't didn't seem to really hurt the team in fact seemed to kind of fire them up and make them work harder
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		after he was gone
 	
 	
 		yeah i think Lou Pinella is doing a good job too obviously
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he knows you know he's
 		you know he's been there he's played a lot of ball himself
 		so he's been in some World Series and you know he's
 		a lot of experience as a player and it looks like he's doing all right as a manager
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well
 		thanks for this is the first time i've ever been called so it's kind of interesting yeah i usually get home and pick up the phone and do some calling so uh
