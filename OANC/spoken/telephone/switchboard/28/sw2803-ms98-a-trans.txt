 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um i think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service
 		because it it seems like and i'm i'm thinking of the community of community of people that are in jail now i think that maybe if if
 		if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done because they would they understand people more they understand helping people more they understand the plight of people
 	
 	
 		that's true um-hum i agree with you in the sense that uh i think that it's important for people to uh also share give something of themselves
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i think that there's too much
 		in the in uh a way of like self-gratification today
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there's not enough sharing
 	
 	
 		um-hum i would think that for like people that are just filthy filthy rich
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they
 		can see and i'm i'm speaking about people that are like born rich
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's all they know and i'm thinking that community service would help them uh just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know if they were to work in in uh uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know in a soup kitchen or something they would understand how other people live
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know on the same note if poor if
 		poorer people  uh were working to to serve the community
 		i don't know they probably have a better perspective of of i don't know just life itself
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think the Peace Corps is great too because uh it you go to different countries and you see
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh you know in fact i saw an interview on TV the other night with uh Patrick Swayze and he's making a movie in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think it's uh
 		Calcutta or either India somewhere where it's a it's a very poor poor country
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he said that people in the West
 		he said since being there and i guess he's been there about six months he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		and he said that people have no idea he said of of what human sacrifice is you know since being there he's he's learned to what it is to be poor and have nothing and yet those people have
 		uh such uh a happy
 	
 	
 		um-hum demeanor yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh yeah in in other words they don't dwell on on what they don't have they dwell on what they do have and they're happy with each other type of thing
 	
 	
 		right
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		and he said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it it's just completely changed his life
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i i think that that you know this on the same note
 		being he was exposed to that and maybe he wasn't before and now he sees and i think that anybody that works
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		in the in some kind of service or for the community or something they can see you know you don't see what you don't you can't know what you don't see
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		exactly right
 	
 	
 		you know so and you have to experience some things you know a lot of people know that people that other people are poor
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you they don't know what poor is
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		unless they actually see it and you know help or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i i know that it that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of uh you know helping them learn how to survive how to plant how to find water and i've seen so many uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		extraordinary things on TV that people have done
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		working in the Peace Corps and how you know uh the people or the community they worked in is so much better
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's like one person can make a difference
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i i really believe that they can in something like that
 	
 	
 		there's something i i've really been skeptical of you know when you watch television you'll see the service announcement for children in other countries
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and if you want to send like you know fifty cents a day
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		or something like that and you can help a child
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's
 		i don't know i guess it's just me but i don't know whether to trust that or not
 		i mean there are so many scams and things going on you know i would love to help somebody
 	
 	
 		i know
 		and how do you
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know but i just i can't bring myself to
 		trust
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		this this company who's trying to do this or whatever it is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know just because people are so i don't know just today people are just so money hungry that i think they would do anything
 	
 	
 		i know
 		it's true it really is it's the sad life i think today it's um
 	
 	
 		and so i mean you don't know what they
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's it it's not like it used to be even in in the years of my growing up i mean i'm fifty three years old and i have seen a town change from a town to a city
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you would think that more people would be better you know share more do more you know be more community oriented and all but if they just get more uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		unto themselves kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah more self-centered um
 	
 	
 		right and and it's not the sharing of uh a neighbor to a neighbor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and  we would go out and not even lock our doors
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and not even worry about it
 	
 	
 		but you can't do that today
 	
 	
 		but today i mean you know it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know
 	
 	
 		yeah even when when i first moved to Dallas from New York it seemed like Dallas was so open you know everybody left their doors open you just run in the store you leave your car running
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and this was only uh well i guess it has been awhile it's been almost ten years since i moved here and it's amazing now now how much it's changed i mean i don't go out i don't go outsid e at night you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		in Dallas they
 		i was going to say because i i heard uh in fact i was talking to someone from Dallas uh just last week they was saying that uh in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for TI and she had gone over seas to Tokyo
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she shouldn't go because she was alone you know being a girl from another country and everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she said they thought for a few seconds and they said uh no there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid
 		they said to her that even if she left her purse
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		on the subway
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		okay that she would have that purse returned to her
 		this is how confident they were okay with nothing missing
 	
 	
 		wow
 		wow
 	
 	
 		okay this is a foreign country
 	
 	
 		better
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you would think you know uh being uh an American or whatever you know a foreigner there that that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 		oh
 		God that would be the exact opposite here i mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it
 	
 	
 		okay
 		and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in in and around Dallas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's where she was from
 	
 	
 		um-hum that is sad
 	
 	
 		she said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that that's a big that's a big thing with me i live in a one bedroom i'm single
 	
 	
 		you know she had there are certain
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i've i could live in an apartment i live in Waco okay and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i live i don't make a lot of money but i live in the high price apartments simply because i feel safe here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i pay i'm paying probably the hundred or hundred and fifty dollars more
 		than i would be paying somewhere else but i wouldn't be able to sleep at night and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be you know i feel very safe where i am
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know instead of
 	
 	
 		and that that's why i think if people were more exposed to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh especially uh young kids getting out of high school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean at one time they would go into the service to have the same exposure and you know uh to further their worldliness so to speak
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and go to see uh foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see it was like they said join the Navy to see the world type of thing you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but nowadays they don't do that anymore it's not uh a thing uh a lot of young men don't even uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		have the desire to go into the service
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't even consider it
 	
 	
 		or to uh you know do something for someone else
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah and it
 	
 	
 		and i don't know i i attributed i think a lot of that to women working
 	
 	
 		to
 	
 	
 		you know to mothers not being at home
 	
 	
 		yes yes i was talking to someone yesterday about that and we were saying that the basic uh the the basic family is is disrupted these days
 	
 	
 		the bonding process yep
 		it very definitely is
 	
 	
 		and so i think you know before the father would work and the mother you know would stay home and having that mother there that base i think was a big part of of family big part of
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		of what you know your your uh youngsters thought about what they did you know
 	
 	
 		yep
 		and the thing is like i think a man can afford to support a woman
 		but the woman affords the luxuries
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in in other words like anyone can live on a certain income no matter what it is you have to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		so to speak okay it it's what's important to you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now a family i i think that like girls today have children and six weeks later they're back to work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		they don't even have a bonding with that child they don't ever ever see the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child the first like say six years of life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so much happens in that period of time
 	
 	
 		when i called
 	
 	
 		and i mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		big deal i mean they're they're in school you're at work that's great but it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and the
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
