 		i mean Star Search Star Trek
 		yeah uh-huh
 		okay is
 	
 	
 		can't be compared at all it
 	
 	
 		is it better in your opinion
 	
 	
 		oh much better
 	
 	
 		um-hum what's better about it
 	
 	
 		uh well it's it's it's it's better put together better better dialogues the the the uh
 		the the stories are a little deeper and and and the the the technology of course that they use is much more believable from a from a scientific aspect also they're they're much more sound about what they say and do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		is it much more believable sounds like i would i would probably like that better then the the old Star
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh it's got got a lot more credibility than than the others also they they they they touch you know a a a a lot of issues that are are are quite relevant you know
 	
 	
 		okay
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah yeah yeah i like it
 	
 	
 		maybe i ought to try it out sometimes  uh

 		right you like that show
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i like that um i don't watch a whole lot of television but when i do i like just a lot of sitcoms because i look at television myself as
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		kind of a get away so i don't i don't like to watch a lot of serious movies uh not on television anyway uh when i watch TV i like to kind of getaway kind of laugh and that i like i even like to watch the sitcoms
 	
 	
 		yeah well that
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well sure
 		it's a it's a good escape
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right now i'm watching uh
 		The Wonder Years
 	
 	
 		The Wonder Years that's a good show
 	
 	
 		and yeah yeah and i like that because the
 		you kind of get to think along with the characters you know so that's why
 	
 	
 		yeah well uh you you you don't sound old enough
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		to to  to go back that far  uh i am unfortunately uh so  i was there during the sixties and i that that's what i love about the show it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 		oh
 	
 	
 		back a lot of memories and it's it's it it's amazingly accurate
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum i was going to ask if it if it's accurate for you uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah it it it it really is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		because i really can't i guess i can't tell but i i enjoy watching it and i think we learned a lot from it
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		you know and how it was back back then and you know
 	
 	
 		yes yes well it it it is it it is accurate there's there there is um uh
 	
 	
 		because of you
 	
 	
 		the the latter part of the sixties was totally dominated by Vietnam and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		those issues and i mean you know it was it was everywhere and and that is the one thing that i notice they sort of shy away from a little bit
 	
 	
 		right
 		hum
 	
 	
 		i mean  they hit it a little it but they don't you know i mean it was in everything at the time i was in college and and it totally dominated college but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh at at at one point uh before nineteen what was it i guess it was
 		seventy
 		you know uh when they enacted the the what they called the lottery
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		system of the draft in which um you know uh uh
 		everyone's everyone's birthday was chosen it was chosen at random and and only the first third of those were taken and and and would be inducted into the you know Army the Army was the only one accepting toward the end
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so um
 		you know it it it it really was terrible because uh until until that it least every one was going crazy at least when they inducted uh they they did the lottery only only one third of the people were going crazy because
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right right
 	
 	
 		they were going to go have to go and it was a war that was really quite unpopular but
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was kind of crazy
 	
 	
 		yeah unlike this war that we just got out of here
 	
 	
 		yeah anyway so so but but they they should uh uh you you you you know i think maybe maybe hit that a little heavier on that show what other shows you watch
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um i like the Thursday night lineup on NBC the Cosby Show A Different World Cheers i really like Cheers and uh even
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah Cheers  i i used to like the Cosby Show i've kind of gotten burned out on that though
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm kind of getting burned out but i still watch it i guess just for the heck of it because i've been watching it
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i like Evening Shade a lot of the new
 	
 	
 		yeah i've got a friend that keeps threatening to kill me if i don't watch Evening Shade
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a really good show that's a really good show
 	
 	
 		she says that it's it's a really good show so i'm going to have to check it out
 	
 	
 		and uh Designing
 		Designing Women i like that a lot uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh
 		so do i
 	
 	
 		yeah i like a lot of the newer a lot of the newer shows i like um there's
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i i i was really glad to hear that they were finally taking that dinosaur off what Dallas did it's last show
 	
 	
 		oh yes that was Friday in fact i went to a last episode of Dallas party
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		at a friend's house and we just all got together and watched the last episode although although we didn't although we hadn't watched it in years you know yeah it really was everyone was pre tty disappointed in the ending
 	
 	
 		oh they
 		
 
 		yeah i hear it was the dog of a show
 		
 
 		oh well go out with a whimper
 	
 	
 		so yeah exactly uh
 	
 	
 		i guess that's the way to go
 	
 	
 		what else do you watch besides Star Trek
 	
 	
 		oh do is there anything else on
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no no i i uh i watch a lot of i've got cable here so i don't watch a lot of network stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i mean you know the typical three networks i um i do watch a lot of CNN stuff and and uh uh i'm home most of the time so
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		yeah i find myself watching a lot of CNN i like they have a fashion show on CNN that i like to watch
 	
 	
 		huh yeah i i got really uh i mean i i i watched it a lot before the the the Saudi crisis but after that uh it just seemed like it it became apart of my every day viewing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right you feel like you really don't know what's going on unless you tune in at least for you know fifteen minutes or so and
 	
 	
 		yeah and and that's what i like about it i can tune in any time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right and get the all all the days events uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and get all the yeah i don't have to you know uh view it at at a certain time of day i can i can check it out anytime generally and uh and find out what's going on and i like that i
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i remember  i remember when Turner started that thing they said that it would never fly and for the first year or two it really it really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		sort of wallowed but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah and and if you know notice i mean it's gone so far in the with just with just with this
 	
 	
 		well the thing is is that that the world finds out most i mean like you know it was interesting uh like during the Saudi crisis the people here were finding out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		about more what was happening by watching CNN than they were getting i mean the military folks even
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right and the the networks themselves were depending on CNN
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh exactly
 	
 	
 		for a lot of things you know they would make they would even mention CNN and have their footage on and everything
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		yeah
 		yeah so it it it it really has become sort of like the world's eye
 	
 	
 		so their going to become
 		right exactly
 	
 	
 		uh and and i you know it was a it was an idea whose time had come that Turner's quite a character
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um um-hum
 	
 	
 		Ted Turner
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway i really enjoy i really enjoy having access to that all the time
