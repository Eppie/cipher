 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay i guess we're set
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		current events
 	
 	
 		i get my current events basically from news uh just because i watch pretty much a lot of television um
 	
 	
 		television news
 		is it uh
 		CNN or Headline News or just local news or what it
 	
 	
 		uh i watch a little bit of everything i like to tune into CNN to CNN because uh and you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on everything in about five or ten minutes i think news today um
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		it's kind of losing its importance like on in in on radio if you hear any news at all it's like two seconds you know really quickly on regular stations
 	
 	
 		right well on commercial radio i guess i i tend to get more of my news from
 		national public radio in the morning on the way to work evening on the way to school so
 	
 	
 		yeah that's good too uh-huh i like KRLD
 	
 	
 		so i don't uh
 		i don't see much TV mostly when i'm in school but i do here
 	
 	
 		yeah where do you go to school
 	
 	
 		uh University of Texas at Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh okay i went to UT at Austin
 	
 	
 		so right
 	
 	
 		but uh i'm a news reporter so i  i should get all i can my news from the news from the TV
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		i do tend to throw on Headline News when i'm doing things around the house and just let it play and listen but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i usually don't intentionally although i should i don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		or i don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news
 		if it comes on i just happen to hear it
 		now i will intentionally buy a newspaper to watch to
 		to look at the news but other than
 	
 	
 		yeah all i ever get out of the paper is the Sunday paper so
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		i read the comics that's about it yeah
 	
 	
 		that's about it the Sunday paper it's so full of stuff but you pick your favorite section and the rest you throw away although you paid what almost two dollars now to get it but
 	
 	
 		right right
 		i like to listen to uh national public radio on the way to work because it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's variety you know they throw in a little news and a little bit of other stuff it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		tends to get
 		like Headline News if you listen to it for an hour when you
 	
 	
 		is it is it pretty good coverage on there i mean um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah it usually is and they throw in a lot of you know a lot of interviews and commentaries it's kind of like getting a newspaper there's a lot of
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		sections to it and they they present different sides of things
 	
 	
 		hum
 		because i find like on KRLD i like to listen to that but each story is like no more than two or three lines
 		you know so it's
 	
 	
 		oh well they spend a little more time you know they cover the headlines and then they go into a lot of issues and things where they they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and interviewing people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that'd probably be better
 		especially when you listen to the like popular radio stations like mostly the music stations
 	
 	
 		and it's
 	
 	
 		news is is pretty much nonexistent they'll have little little teeny weeny news breaks you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and only in the morning i guess there's a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah basically
 	
 	
 		i haven't listened to a
 		top forty radio station in so long i wouldn't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		so let's see um
 	
 	
 		and i guess i get some kinds of
 		other of you know business related news through trade journals and things but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's about it
 	
 	
 		the only reason i get trade journals is like if i'm looking for a job or something
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		which is what i'm doing now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah  trying to get out of wherever they are
 	
 	
 		a lot of people are
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		but uh i think i think news is
 		i'm wondering where it's going
 		you know how
 		i think it would be nonexistent pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper
 		uh i know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news
 		and now it's it's kind of your final choice you watch first you go to CNN then you go to radio or something like that i think it
 	
 	
 		yeah well nobody wants to sit down and read
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it takes a lot more time to read something and you've got news bombarding you from everywhere now you know you turn on the TV turn on the radio
 	
 	
 		yeah so much for my effort
 		yeah yeah
 		but i think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again
 	
 	
 		why is that
 	
 	
 		i don't well just because i'm i'm thinking that it it's getting so short on radio just you
 		you still you have two or three i know in Dallas you can probably get two two all news radio stations
 		out of i don't how many popular radio stations and then on television you have just the news at six and ten
 	
 	
 		yeah i just
 	
 	
 		and i just i just see that dwindling in in
 	
 	
 		i find it hard to believe that people'll go back to reading over television i mean just given the way
 		society is and i enjoy reading but most people would rather turn on the tube and
 	
 	
 		true yeah
 		true that's true too yeah
 	
 	
 		and and flip through the channels you know and get the headline news that thirty minutes of
 	
 	
 		than sit down and take the effort to read the paper
 	
 	
 		right
 		and they don't have to go get one you know
 	
 	
 		one thing i like about the paper um as opposed to television is that
 		uh
 		when i like when i report
 		because i'm in television i have to get the basic the main facts and that's it that's all you have time for whereas in the paper i like to read the articles because they get every side every single side and
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and every point they make you know and and it's all there
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's why i like uh national public radio because when they get on one of these little they they give you headlines that are brief
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just they touch on what's going on and then they'll get into something and really explore it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's it's informative it's a lot more informative than you know a quick half hour news show that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they tell you what they want you to hear
 	
 	
 		yeah because that's what we do i mean it's like each each story is thirty seconds
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know so it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time
 		so and it'll probably get shorter and shorter
 		as the years go by i think
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah there's so much going on in the world
 		communication you know spans the world now and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		there's too much going on you can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there
 	
 	
 		i think that is one good thing one great thing about news and that we saw right during the war just now is that
 		we got all the information within minutes you know whatever happened we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and the question is how much of it or some how some of it i guess there's a lot of debate about censorship and and what we're really seeing is it is it the true story or is it a little bit biased
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		because even though we do get the story right away they were censored as to what they could tell us so all we had to sit here and and ask is well what aren't they telling us
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know so that that was pretty scary but we i talked to one woman and
 		she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia she wouldn't want to know you know that they're bombing or or this and that's going on
 		and at the same time i talked to another woman and she
 		was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam
 		and she didn't know what was happening at that time and she was so happy to get the information
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know so it's just
 		a lot of different opinions on that
 	
 	
 		i i you know i like to to know what's going on sometimes i think there's just a little bit too much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you get in the habit of
 		like i say turn on Headline News and it'll play over and over and you just tune it out because it's the same thing but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and then too a lot of times
 		i think uh especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion it's like
 	
 	
 		yeah they tend to dramatize things that are
 	
 	
 		you know like this Kennedy thing it's just i mean everywhere you turn Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy you know what kind of shoes did he wear on the night and you know it's just like okay this is ridiculous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		like who cares really
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		but what are you doing something on a computer oh i heard the little clicking
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		trying to
 		do some C programming
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay well it was nice talking to you okay take care bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay take care um-hum bye
