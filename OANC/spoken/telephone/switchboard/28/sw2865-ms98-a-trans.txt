 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay i think we're supposed to discuss the changes in the roles of women in the last generation or two and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and my opinion is that uh the  biggest changes uh probably are about two
 		and one of course is obvious and that's the working woman
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh the second one which i don't know if you'd go along with or not is that maybe a lot of women are not as uh likely to want to be dominated as past times
 	
 	
 		well that's i would say that's probably true uh i know in in my wife's case she is a very independent sort uh you know she she has a lot of say about uh you know just about everything that uh happens in our family life
 	
 	
 		and you're proud of that
 	
 	
 		and yes i am i i you know i i feel very confident that if you know something were to happen to me or to us either one that uh you know she would be
 		capable of taking care of her own you know what ever her own needs are right and and i think that's very important
 	
 	
 		of course
 		well uh another uh thing that i want to talk about is which of the the changes that you can think of are the most significant
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i i really think that that that independence of of women is uh probably more important an and i guess that uh really came about because of the change or a lot of it anyway because of the change in the work force
 		uh with more women working and having uh more uh important or or uh
 		what's the right term anyway their jobs is being you know more people depending on them and more management decisions made
 		i think that uh lends to being you know more independent and
 		stepping out and saying what you want to say and what needs to be said
 	
 	
 		well and don't you think that you do see more women who are um becoming part of middle management
 	
 	
 		yes i i i that's even even uh upper management is is uh i think is going to be a a coming thing for for women too uh
 		and in the professions also not just uh not just within company management but you know professional people that uh
 		are going out on their own attorneys and lawyers i'm an accountant a CPA
 	
 	
 		attorneys
 	
 	
 		and uh i know quite a few women CPA's you know that are out working on their own running their own accounting practice and doing quite well
 	
 	
 		uh-huh let me ask you a question uh while we're talking about the CPA women uh in uh a firm say do you think uh a woman CPA gets paid equally to a man
 	
 	
 		uh i would i'm not sure but i would think so within uh within a public accounting firm
 		uh if they're on the same level of responsibility now i would say that there's you know some
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh or i would even say a probability
 		that women still have it a little more difficult to achieve the same level that a man does uh there's you know there's still some stereotypes uh within even within the the accounting practice
 	
 	
 		what and even within women
 		that they perhaps some women do not expect uh
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		
 
 		um but um within public within public accounting
 		within the what is now the big six accounting firms in particular the uh the people that's starting off in accounting uh have an awful lot
 		of uh hours to work and and there's a lot of stress put on them uh a lot of requirements for
 		uh you know traveling and being available all uh hours and and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		going away on those audits
 	
 	
 		right and and i think that uh that some women may you know they may tend still tend to to not want to do that  to the point that they would restrict their own possibility for
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh for promotion to achieve that but you know the ones that the ones that really want to uh certainly can go ahead and achieve that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well what what future do you see for us in the next twenty years say
 	
 	
 		um i i would say that uh
 		there will be you know in the business world there will be more uh opportunities more expansion of the women's role in business
 		and i see uh women's roles expanding in the political area uh quite a bit uh of course you know we in Texas we've got uh uh a uh woman governor now
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		uh and we've had the all let's see what have we got uh four say five major cities in Texas that have all had women mayors i think uh recently uh three
 		at least three of them have women mayors now
 	
 	
 		Charlotte also has a woman mayor
 	
 	
 		and uh you know i see i see uh
 		you know the movement of women into into the political arena as being very important uh
 	
 	
 		well i'll tell you what worries me a little bit about uh the role of women these days and i'm hoping that that's going to be a change and i don't know if you see it or not my husband doesn't always uh
 		see it or understand it uh and that is the uh the trial of trying to be the superwoman the supermom the
 	
 	
 		yeah the supermom yes
 	
 	
 		yes and uh i have gone through that uh myself and it is hell it really is is tough and to be able to excuse myself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		from doing that was a wonderful liberation
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i guess i had i think the woman pretty much has to do it themselves but i believe that in the future that they're going to stop trying to be all things
 	
 	
 		right
 		right i i think they'll be uh  you know in in the political area i suppose uh
 		for for the most part politicians have gone through their a a good bit of their business life before they get into politics
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and and i think that that if that's the the situation for women they will have had their family life and their business life you know may be earlier and then move into politics
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think that's uh you know that's the way that uh that you can have you know women can have all things you you just can't have them all at once  and uh i think that's you know that's the case for men  you know for the most part too
 	
 	
 		yes and
 		a very i will say this very quickly i had an attorney friend who said and he'd been practicing probably twenty five years and he said i wish there were more women in politics
 		they are not quite as crooked
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 		well i i think that's uh that's the truth and and i i think that there's i think and this is uh may be a bad thing for me to say but i think that women have a higher moral uh character for the most part
 		than men do and it you know the  along the sexual type you know the
 	
 	
 		the acceptable
 	
 	
 		the the the little things that men that get involved in
 	
 	
 		morals that we uh-huh yes
 	
 	
 		right that uh women just don't tend to do that of of course it takes you know it takes a man and a women both but i think that women have
 		or or a little more uh discreet or at at least a little more careful about what they do and are and you know
 	
 	
 		are reticent about it anyway
 	
 	
 		woman a woman congressman's not going to have her picture taken on a boat somewhere out in the Caribbean with you know with some young guy you know for the most part yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		however i being uh uh former employer myself
 		i did change from being someone who i who felt that women could uh share out share it one job and things like that and i became
 		more understanding of how men often are  are for for many years have thought about uh
 		women in the working world and my husband couldn't believe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he started teasing me and calling me a male chauvinist or a female chauvinist but but i do i think there certainly some pluses uh on both sides we just need to get them all put together
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		well it's been so nice talking to you and good luck to you good luck to you and have a nice day bye
 	
 	
 		right and uh
 		yeah it's been nice talking to you too
 		okay thank you you too um-hum you too bye
