 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what do you think about the benefits in jobs
 	
 	
 		um i'm i'm
 		relatively relatively satisfied with the benefits i have i think that um our health insurance is terribly expensive
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money
 		but um you know that's that's my major complaint i guess what about you
 	
 	
 		yeah and a lot of times they turn down your claims so that leaves you paying for all of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		or or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		right the the health insurance i have is MetLife and if it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then uh you just pay  ten dollars and then uh the insurance pays the rest of the bill
 		or if you go outside you get uh seventy thirty
 	
 	
 		i see
 		now we i have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered but what i found recently is
 		what they've been doing is they they poll somehow the area
 		and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so recently when when we had a claim
 		um they didn't pay the eighty five percent they paid much lower and when i called they said oh well that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area and i was really surprised because
 		either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out
 		or their you know their statistics aren't very accurate
 	
 	
 		right and and they're probably doing it to their benefit anyway so
 	
 	
 		yeah i would assume that you know whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it's it's difficult What about other other benefits are there others that you're dissatisfied with
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well i work for Sears and and um that's about the the only real benefit you have is health insurance
 	
 	
 		well you have vacation i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah but everybody gets vacation i mean like uh TI and some other places you know they have social recreational facilities and
 		they have a driving range and weight room and you know i think they even have a swimming pool and
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm not familiar with that sort of thing but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but you know to me vacation  is is an issue and i mean different places have different amounts of vacation i would assume
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um you know the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay perhaps or um
 		um i don't know i suppose um sick days some places count the number of hours and some places just sort of believe you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um ours is based on number of days and you know people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		right
 		but um otherwise
 		i'm not not aware of any problems with the benefits around here
 		so maybe that covers the topic then
 	
 	
 		yeah well i don't know the working the working conditions you know if you could include that in benefits
 		some places aren't very safe to work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you that you have to work under
 	
 	
 		uh-huh or maybe a benefit uh not really a benefit either but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		um but you know i suppose some places are are more stringent about that than others
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		and and maybe arriving late or something like that you know how how they enforce the rules
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		but other than that i don't have much feeling for  for the benefits since like i said um i don't have a big problem with with them i
 	
 	
 		um Workmen Workmen's Comp is a big thing now in in Texas because um
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		um how much it costs the employers and a a lot of them are going to their own insurance now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it reduces some of the length of the benefits and uh
 		and i don't know besides that but i i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing
 	
 	
 		oh i i didn't know that somebody could avoid Workmen's Compensation
 	
 	
 		well well they still have to pay it but they buy their own instead of going through the state
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		so apparently it costs less that way
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		i suppose that whenever companies can avoid um benefits it's to the to to the benefit of the company
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and at least you know financially in the short run but i would think they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied working for them
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i what i think they they should be able they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are
 		and how much profit they're making instead of trying to cut everything down and then have everybody be unhappy and and have a constant turnover of people
 	
 	
 		right i mean sure the payroll is lower that way but i would assume that the productivity is way down also
 	
 	
 		yeah the productivity and the training costs if they have to train the same employee a new employee every six months then i don't see how they can save money
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		no i agree
 	
 	
 		yeah okay it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		well thank you for calling bye-bye
 	
 	
 		yeah bye-bye
