 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but we needed to get back uh to our older parents
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i am loving it the weather is divine
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		was uh did you like Oklahoma while you were there
 	
 	
 		oh yes very much yeah
 	
 	
 		um what did you all do
 	
 	
 		well my husband was with uh University of Oklahoma and Phillips University in Enid and then he went with uh a family corporation that had uh has oil and ranching
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and varied enterprises
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh he just quit a perfectly good job and came we came East  yes
 	
 	
 		really
 		so is uh is he working there then or
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh he's doing uh quite a bit of consulting work and has been offered a permanent position and he's contemplating he he's liking this free time actually
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's just wonderful after all these years of working
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well how did how did you get uh hooked up with the TI switchboard thing
 	
 	
 		um  a gal who works uh with TI on this project i think she's a temporary worker uh mother is my best friend in Virginia so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh i see i see
 	
 	
 		we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well i
 		my wife has talked more than i have uh she's talked to four five different people it seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from Dallas in fact she's talked to a couple of people from North Carolina i think yeah
 	
 	
 		really uh what is her name
 	
 	
 		her name's Tina
 	
 	
 		yeah well i haven't talked to her i haven't i haven't talked to a Tina yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh well uh the the call was probably for her they wouldn't accept my uh T I N number so we put hers in but uh uh like i said we're getting getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party so but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		some what yeah i i've only talked to one or two and they've they've all been in Dallas but she hasn't talked to anybody in Dallas yet so that's interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well you haven't told me uh what sports that you are active in
 	
 	
 		well the sport i like best probably is basketball but uh i guess i'm probably better at softball and so i'd like during the summer months it's occupies quite a bit of my time but
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i play in a couple of leagues and and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend but my family usually goes with me we try to do everything we can together
 	
 	
 		well i think that's uh easy entertainment for a family too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well they
 		uh a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams we uh that's usually the team i play on with the tournaments and stuff and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age so they play together pretty well and
 	
 	
 		under the stands under the bleachers
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah pretty much and uh Tina enjoys uh the other lady real well so they you know that's kind of nice it's like getting together with them so to speak
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		yes well it's getting a little hot isn't it it
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's been raining a lot here so far so we haven't really had any kind of real heat i think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in in the house so it looks like an air conditioner day but
 	
 	
 		yeah it sure does or maybe this evening anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah it yeah but you know i'm sure you're familiar with that living here we go we go through Enid you know quite a bit we go to Tulsa from time to time and my my parents live in southern Illinois so we drive up there and
 	
 	
 		very much so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well lots lot of times we take seventy five and uh it seems like
 		seems like that goes through Enid i know i've either seen the signs or
 	
 	
 		no no it doesn't Enid is uh it's in the northwest it's uh directly across the straight uh state from Tulsa
 	
 	
 		um i know i've seen the sign somewhere yeah
 	
 	
 		uh sure you have yes well Enid is not uh an unknown little city it uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		an awful lot of people know where it is or have been there and it was uh a very uh self-sufficient uh wealthy uh town for a long time anyway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know until uh everything happened the bottom fell out
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it's beginning to do well but there's a lot of uh old time wealth there that has helped to stabilize things
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		so uh how long you said you've just lived in North Carolina just like six months then is
