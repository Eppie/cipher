 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well do you think we're paying too much in taxes right now
 	
 	
 		well frankly i think we're paying too little i think we have paid too little since Reagan and them decided to cut it
 		uh i used to get these uh surveys from the Republican Party from time to time asking if i thought it was a good idea for them to cut taxes
 		and i kept saying no i felt like what we ought to do is cut spending and keep taxes the way they were well granted maybe the only way they could keep the spending to be uh
 		that is curtail the spending and cut it was to cut taxes forcing spending to have to be cut but uh i always felt like the Congress uh just ought to shoulder responsibilities of biting the bullet
 		uh that they uh uh are are supposed to be able to uh you know handle shoulder
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh cut their spending and if they had uh done that without cutting taxes we wouldn't find ourselves in economic quagmire we're in now
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think too many people are not paying enough taxes some are paying too much uh the the middle class but the uh upper class the wealthy people are not paying enough
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think the legislation that there ought to be legislation that make makes it more equitable for uh depending on how much you earn
 	
 	
 		are you so you like the progressive income tax
 	
 	
 		yeah i sure do uh-huh i we think everybody ought to be paying their fair share there still too many loopholes available to to get by with
 	
 	
 		well
 		well i i thought they had closed most of the uh loopholes when they came out with this uh pretty well constant fixed tax type uh about the only well i know there are a few you're right about that but
 		primarily the only thing that was supposed to be any longer tax deductible was your your first and second home mortgages the interest that is
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		and that was about it now i think there are still some real estate oriented type tax hedges
 	
 	
 		they cut it back on rental property income
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that uh you can't uh get uh tax deductions on uh say a second third fourth house that you own on paying uh taxes on on that
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's where the rich see uh certainly have a second third fourth and fifth house
 	
 	
 		right
 		and they also cut back on things like limited partnerships
 	
 	
 		right uh in what way what loopholes then are are left that you're talking about
 	
 	
 		well the maximum tax bracket is twenty eight percent
 	
 	
 		right well thirty three if you're in that hump but
 	
 	
 		so nobody can pay any higher than right
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh uh
 		uh i i felt like they ought to cut the capital gains tax
 	
 	
 		i think that's right too i agree with that
 	
 	
 		because it it for for once finally with taxes having been cut it makes the little investor like myself capable if you're able to set aside a little money aside to do a little investing and make a few bucks without getting it all taken away from you
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and you ought to get your salary taxed once and if you're able to save some money to be able to invest in
 		stocks and bonds and various things like that then to get it stuck to you again seems just a little bit unfair
 	
 	
 		right
 		i'm saying the way our taxes are structured right now it does not encourage saving
 	
 	
 		no it really doesn't but on the other hand how how um how would we change it to encourage saving
 	
 	
 		um well that that's a good question
 	
 	
 		and go back to things like tax free IRAs and like that they wound up coming back
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree with that that that's i uh
 	
 	
 		okay yeah i thought that was a good move too that certainly in
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i wish we would do that i'm in a bracket right now where i cannot take advantage of an IRA getting a tax deduction on it
 	
 	
 		i hear you
 	
 	
 		i used to be able to do that but uh i can't now and so then there's also the problem now where i've got some contributions that were tax deductible and some that aren't and i have to keep those separate
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and now that
 		right
 		yeah and that's absolutely unfair i agree
 		and it seems like every time Congress and and and uh the presidency gets a set up like the had now see that's the kind of tax cuts i'm for
 		not necessarily just a a broad range tax cut on salaries so much but tax cuts where they don't tax savings of various kinds you know savings where you're willing to tie your money up at least some minimum period of time some some
 		uh minimum number of years and all like like IRAs were
 		uh it it that that those are reasonable alternatives that the average person can get in on and not just the rich alone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh uh seems like every time that uh people begin to make a little money at that and a lot of people jumped on IRAs i mean you did you apparently you apparently did and a lot of people i know did too
 	
 	
 		oh i still do contribute to an IRA even though i can't take advantage of any tax breaks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i'm in one too but it seems like as soon as they uh got to going like gangbusters and the Congress saw that big pile of money beginning to form out there they wanted to come in and tax it again
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and and uh that that's only again because they would not
 		uh uh police themselves and their spending
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i i don't know i i don't know what else to do about it i mean seems like we are are are constantly reelecting Republican presidents and Democratic Congresses or Democratic presidents and Republican Congresses and they can't ever seem to get together
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think one of the things that may maybe does encourage encourage uh saving in a small way is that you can't write off taxes on personal spending
 		uh that may keep a again that may cause a recession as well though because it keeps people from going going out and charging their credit cards uh to the max
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it cuts down on uh how much uh spending were their going to uh do for the year
 	
 	
 		do you think this latest interest cut rate cut that the Fed just went through is going to uh get people back on the spending
 	
 	
 		i'm not so sure about that uh we're still uh in a recession as such and uh it that tax that cut in the in the the prime has not encouraged activity in the market yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think people are going to follow the stock market if if it takes off
 		uh that's a good indicator that the economy is turning around and people are going to start spending again right now a lot of people are fearful about their jobs
 	
 	
 		well
 		oh yeah i know exactly how you feel
 	
 	
 		there are a lot of layoffs uh you know unemployment's way up and uh they're just saving money uh until things get better
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh uh-huh i uh was talking to a fellow today and he seemed to think it was going to make a difference but i said hey if a lot of people are all ready borrowed up
 		to the hilt i don't care how cut low you cut taxes they can't afford to borrow anymore or they won't just because they want to try to get a handle on what they have that you you've got to cut them
 		drastically such that the uh idea of refinancing
 		at a lower interest rate becomes the thing to do
 	
 	
 		right well you can do that with say a mortgage payment but they charge so many points in order to refinance a lot of people can't afford that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and
 		that's right or or less the break is considerable between the the interest rates and the cut between say eleven percent mortgage down to no more than nine percent mortgage that's not enough you've got to get down to eight maybe even seven and a half
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's basically what we're doing right now is uh people a lot of people have eleven percent mortgages and they can get nine percent now but it costs them three points to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and that's not enough you need a eight percent loan to be able to do that
 	
 	
 		three percent of yeah three percent of their mortgage mortgage right now or or of the uh principal that's left on their loan is uh a significant chunk of change
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and uh a lot of people aren't aren't in a position to take advantage of that
 	
 	
 		so i i i'm not so sure myself that uh that cutting interest rates is going to do it or cutting taxes either i just think we've gotten ourselves so
 		uh gone through such a uh uh period of time where we've been so credit hungry
 		and um we have gotten uh u h so out on a limb in debt not only uh federal debt but consumer debt too
 		that uh i'm really concerned whether any kind of taxation one way or the other is going to make a difference
 	
 	
 		yeah well another thing that uh kind of irks me right now is i just got my tax appraisal on my house and it went up ten thousand dollars from last year
 	
 	
 		uh uh-huh
 		well you know that's what's happened to me i got my appraisal well we get them up here they give them to you three years out
 	
 	
 		there's
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean you you get one every year but it it it
 		puts in at a what they expect it to be for the next three years you know based on what it is right now subject to change of course
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh real estate values up here in in the uh uh uh eastern corridor have dropped about two and a half to five percent
 	
 	
 		real estate values here have dropped at least ten percent over the past uh two years
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well see the pressure's is more up here so it hasn't dropped quite as bad because the population being what it is but nevertheless it's dropped
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh this hasn't been reflected in my appraisals and i was just telling my wife the other night you know i says i i wonder who it is you talk to here in the state about about protesting this because
 		if and only uh interest rates i'm sorry uh property values don't come back up
 		which means i can see that i can uh get again at least what i could have gotten for my house a year ago then i'm not being fairly appraised
 	
 	
 		right
 		there's no justification here for an increase in uh the value of a home
 		the property values are still going down and i'm not sure they've hit the bottom yet
 	
 	
 		um in the Texas area
 	
 	
 		so uh when when they
 		yes when they all of a sudden increase with all the layoffs and what not uh real estate prices have not been going up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		ha
 	
 	
 		uh there's too many too many homes on the market right now too many people are just bailing out on their homes and leaving them their abandoning abandoning their homes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is a lot of that going on
 	
 	
 		oh yes there's two homes on my street right now that sure
 	
 	
 		um that's going to put the banks in dire straights
 		because the banks don't want the property they want the money
 	
 	
 		that's right there are a lot of banks that are in trouble we've had banks that have been closing for the past two years in Texas we've got a record number of banks that have been gone all ready gone under
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well do you see where the tax situation could really help that any
 	
 	
 		uh no i don't i think that's mostly with the economy and the job market
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i think it's unfair that uh the tax appraisal has gone up this year when in fact the uh the value of the homes has not
 	
 	
 		oh i do too
 		yeah yeah i think it's absolutely unfair but they've gotten into this mentality and uh i don't think they know how to appraise a house down
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know how what they use to justify that uh because say i've got the same model home as some of my neighbors and they're all appraised at the same level
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		even though i've made more improvements on my house than somebody else has and nobody comes out to take a look and see what you've done to get a proper appraisal
 	
 	
 		now out here they do they take pictures of house and everything and what they do is they look at what your particular model at least three of them have sold for within the last twelve months
 		or later if if they have the data they don't always have that much data because they may not have sold that many of your model
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but here they could for instance i i've had to they do it randomly more or less but they try to get three at a time over a twelve month period because uh one of the houses i sold i'm in my third house now i uh
 		my second house i actually had an appraiser come out and take pictures of it uh that he had to go
