 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		what kind of painting are you planning to do
 	
 	
 		well i have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um it's a rent house and i decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper so i decided i'm going to paint
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint
 		and i'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them
 	
 	
 		oh what would be interesting
 	
 	
 		either that or maybe rag rolling to give it kind of a country look
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments but they look very interesting and you get some beautiful effects with them
 	
 	
 		yeah uh one of the books that i bought where it's describing describing the sponge painting said you can like layer different colors and
 	
 	
 		yes yeah i've seen that done where there's uh oh i saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat and then it had a little bit darker sort of peachy color
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in between there was a sort of a rust uh put on very sparingly and it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco
 	
 	
 		
 
 		ooh
 		yeah
 		um what i what i'm trying to do is i've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms so i want something that's going to tie that together
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm changing the like the towel racks and stuff the the fixtures out to make them wood i'm going to put wood in there so it's going to have kind of a country look um
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that should be nice
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i haven't even decided as far as um what kind of paint to buy i don't have an actual instruction book so i'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now
 	
 	
 		well uh
 	
 	
 		um it's going to be a big experiment
 	
 	
 		yeah i was about to say you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because you might find that it's beyond uh what you're willing to put into it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		although i think it could turn out really nice i haven't ever done fancy painting but i sure did my share of just regular painting uh i've painted several houses inside no i
 	
 	
 		yeah i've
 		um-hum inside
 	
 	
 		never painted the outside
 	
 	
 		what what kind of what kind of paint do you normally use
 	
 	
 		well uh we used a latex uh wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork and my job was mostly the woodwork
 	
 	
 		okay
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers and i got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine uh trim work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where i'd use a small brush and uh try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum well we only have one only one of our bathroom has a window in it so i'm hoping that um it won't be too much of a a problem
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm i'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first because i i think
 	
 	
 		well i was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it
 	
 	
 		no i'm i'm planning on taking it off
 	
 	
 		i have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now which make it much easier to get wallpaper off uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago oh with a just a scraper and wet sponge and it took forever i would not recommend that method
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh if
 	
 	
 		well that's something that that's worthwhile checking into then because i
 	
 	
 		if you can rent a steamer if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble If it's really old you don't know what it's put on with
 	
 	
 		it it's hard to tell it's the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i know the house um was built around the mid fifties
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it may be the original wallpaper
 	
 	
 		could be yeah um if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too if it's paper it will probably shred
 	
 	
 		um in one bathroom it's um it's probably paper uh it's silver silver and yellow and white
 	
 	
 		um uh-huh
 		
 
 		well the wallpaper that i was trying to remove was black this this was in a bathroom too
 		and the the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white and the the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background and then it had
 		vivid uh almost neon colors
 		of hot pink and turquoise and lime green and silver and uh a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that
 	
 	
 		um that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom
 	
 	
 		oh it was awful it was absolutely hideous and and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it and a
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		a guest went in there and he said it's a good thing i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something to drink and went in there i would think i was having hallucinations
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
  
 		really
 		well i i've also been thinking about after looking at all these magazines um these design magazines and stuff i'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too in a color that will kind of um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		tie in our um our um
 		our uh comforter um with a color that's kind of um um burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design um and i'm not really sure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know if maybe i'm biting off more than i can chew
 	
 	
 		well i'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale
 	
 	
 		yeah well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting it wouldn't be any kind of special um special effects type thing
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it would be just plain paint
 	
 	
 		well it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time because if you uh use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to
 		trim out uh all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it and it can be done a whole lot faster
 	
 	
 		hm okay
 	
 	
 		and with rollers and uh modern latex paints you can wash up easily because they're water soluble
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they dry fast so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend if you have some help
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and then if that if you discover the little tricks and tips about you know how you get through corners and how you do trim and uh
 		how long to leave the masking tape down because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it
 	
 	
 		it it peels the paint off when you take it off yeah
 	
 	
 		when you pull it up um-hum well not i if you leave it on for weeks it'll do that if you take it up the next day it should be fine
 		you want it to get dry but not uh just real hard you don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried too hard that's the problem it'll come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long
 	
 	
 		yeah okay
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i've i was told i always used the nice wide masking tape but i've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth because it
 	
 	
 		oh really okay
 	
 	
 		uh it rips as you pull it off for one thing and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and the whole point of using it is to save yourself work you can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but use use good uh stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well i really appreciate all the helpful tips i think you are just made my project a lot easier
 	
 	
 		well i wish you very good luck with it and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business the last time i had something done was my kitchen cabinets and i decided that was too much to tackle i'd hire a professional
 	
 	
 		
 
 		if you were if you were closer i'd i'd i'd tell you you could come over and supervise
 	
 	
 		well if i were closer i might oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i hope your project turns out great and i really uh think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting i think that could give it a really
 	
 	
 		well we'll see how it goes  i may just be flat painting over it
 	
 	
 		uh
 		well of course that's the other advantage of paint if you don't like it all you do is put on another coat
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up
 	
 	
 		yep i i need to go to the dentist so it's was nice talking to you Kathleen um bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
 		thank you
