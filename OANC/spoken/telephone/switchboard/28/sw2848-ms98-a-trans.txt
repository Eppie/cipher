 		no
 	
 	
 		nothing like that no
 	
 	
 		uh
 		would would you like to go on one do you think
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so because
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because uh i like to fish
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i camp out and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		well they sure are a lot of fun they sure do a lot uh good eating
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if you like to eat that's the place to go
 		that's one one to go on i i it's the best eating in the world
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i mean it's nonstop the minute you get on the ship until you get off
 		you can start eating and you can eat all night long if you want
 		fantastic
 		i'm going to go to Europe in the in the Fall
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm really looking forward to that i've always wanted to go and
 		i have a friend that's a uh flight attendant for American and her route is London to Dallas so
 		she wants to go see England
 		just because she just flies in and flies out so she  she knows London but she doesn't know the rest  so we're going to go to Wales and Scotland and England
 		i think that'll be fun
 	
 	
 		is that in the Spring that this Summer
 	
 	
 		uh we're going in the Fall September October
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i think that'd be great
 		plus like i say i like i like cruises i'm going with my sister-in-law i'm going on a cruise next summer
 		uh for about seven days and uh i'd i haven't decided i've been to the Bahamas but i think i'd like to try the uh the Mexico one this year the Cozumel and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Puerto Vallarta and that that route around like that i believe this next time
 		but the Bahama one was nice and if that's one of the cruise we can get on i i'll take it again because it was really a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		and the water's real clear down there
 	
 	
 		oh just crystal absolutely crystal clear the fish are just beautiful and if you like snorkeling
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh just you just can't beat it i i love to snorkel
 		and the the beaches are just snow white
 		absolutely snow white have you ever been to the west coast of Florida
 	
 	
 		um no just to Galveston
 	
 	
 		oh well the west coast of Florida all all those beaches are snow white like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the east coast you have to get down to Miami before they're any you know before they're snow white but the west coast is just beautiful
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i i go i moved here from Florida a couple of years ago back from i was living in Texas i went to Florida and came back and uh
 		oh i'm going to retire down there one of these years and it's going to be in on the west coast of Florida because it's so gorgeous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the sand sand is just out of this and it's just like sugar powdered sugar
 		around uh
 		oh Venice Beach and Clearwater especially has beautiful beautiful snow white sand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's really nice
 		but i grew up in Colorado so i don't care for the mountains too much
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and California i'm a native Californian and they have mountains there my mother lives up in northern California
 		they're nice to visit and i didn't enjoy growing up in the mountains and
 		i'd rather go to the sun than i would to the to the mountains i mean they're all right
 		i don't like it because i have to go now see to see me mother i have to go to the the the mountains
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but if i didn't have to
 		if i didn't have to go i would never go
 	
 	
 		did you ever go to Yosemite
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that's pretty isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah it is and i've been to uh of course i grew up in Colorado where it was really mountainous and beautiful
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh when i go back and visit it i'm really disappointed it it it doesn't uh i remember it as a child and it's nothing like what i remembered as a child it's so commercialized and i it really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		made me
 		got kind of turn my stomach when i went back and saw how commercialized it had gotten but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not a camper outer so i you know i if you like to camp out so that's fine but i i don't want to camp out
 		i like the luxuries too much  i guess i'm spoiled i am spoiled
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i spoil myself i guess so i
 	
 	
 		and then in in Colorado it's mostly streams and they've dammed up some of them now so yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it just so you don't
 		Colorado just doesn't really show me anything anymore so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		now my where my mother lives in northern California is absolutely gorgeous i mean just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		picture postcard gorgeous and it it you know it just out of sight but uh it's too uh i've got to be by a big city i i can't stand living that far away i fly up into Oregon and drive down to her house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so she's really way up there and it it i just it's just too far away from a a big city for me i got to have a shopping malls and  what have you
 	
 	
 		and northern California really is out in the boondocks isn't it
 	
 	
 		oh boy she is in  it's it's a good twelve hour hour drive just from San Francisco on winding winding winding river roads
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's way on up past the wine country and everything is like i say it's really gorgeous but
 	
 	
 		but
 		you fly in through Portland then
 	
 	
 		no Medford Oregon
 	
 	
 		oh they have a airport there uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and then drive down it's about an oh an hour hour and a half's drive from Medford Oregon
 		but it's all mountain driving
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and fortunately my sister picks me up i don't have to drive it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		tried driving it once from San Francisco and that was a that was very dumb i'll never try that again
 	
 	
 		they have a they they have a coast highway there don't they or
 	
 	
 		well this uh where my mother lives is uh it kind of in the middle of the state up north so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they're about uh an hour or two drive from the ocean for the coast
 		so you could go up that way but it would be out it would be out of your way better from from to go to her house at like up through Redding and
 		on up that way
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		how far is it from Tahoe
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i don't know four hours i think four no
 		i can't remember i seem like it's eight hours somebody somebody told me it may be
 		it may be twelve so i can't remember mine i know my son
 		went from Tahoe to over to their house so and he knows that i i never have gone there so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		master the mountains too
 	
 	
 		yeah it really like i say it really is gorgeous
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i uh i like the sunshine better i mean i'd rather go out where there's beaches and
 		i don't i like to sun bathe and uh you know it's getting so dangerous now the sun bathe or the sun burns and cancer skin cancer and everything so i load up you know on
 		the sunscreens and so i because the ocean to me is real soothing and comforting comforting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so that's why i like to to go there but and of course i don't like uh i like uh i like to snorkel so i have to go where there's real clear water to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah and around here the uh the Possum Kingdom is about the
 		the closest place
 	
 	
 		is it really uh
 	
 	
 		yeah they have real clear water and plants
 	
 	
 		oh i've never been now where is that near
 	
 	
 		it's uh near um
 		well it's it's kind of near Abilene but it's it's uh about halfway in between here and and Abilene
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		it's uh you if you know where Albany is then uh it's about maybe an hour west of Weatherford
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		out there west of Fort Worth
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's a big it's on the Brazos River they dammed up the Brazos River
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and it's beautiful
 	
 	
 		is it
 		no i i guess i've never been up there my my
 		when i moved up here uh uh uh from Florida i i misplaced my snorkeling i think they what they did they didn't unpack it it must have been in a box or something they didn't unpack because i ended up without my snorkeling equipment and and a few other things and they must have
 		been in a box that i had in my garage and they just didn't get them to me so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm going to have to start from scratch i guess and buy all new snorkeling equipment
 		but i had some really good snorkeling equipment i really hate to start over again but there's no other choice choice but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway have we talked our five minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so
 	
 	
 		okay well it's been nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah nice talking to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		uh-huh bye-bye
