 
     		
 	
 		so you like to fish huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i like to um i don't have a boat but i like to fish and there's a lot of lakes around here um are there many lakes up there
 	
 	
 		yeah actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me we actually uh we have the those little the the the Great Lakes you know Great uh Lake Ontario is right near here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		plus we're in what's called the Finger Lake Region of New York where there're lots of small lakes everywhere and these are uh real good um for like you know bass fishing and so forth
 	
 	
 		they have mostly small mouth in them or
 	
 	
 		no we have a quite actually quite a lot of variety here's uh there's we have large mouth small mouth um sort of musky pike stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know all sorts of fun stuff like that um
 		we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on Lake Ontario every year
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's it's that's a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how about you do you like what what do you like to go for
 	
 	
 		oh it's it's uh i fish for bass but i hardly ever catch one but um
 		um they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon and uh you know they wash when they open up the dam and let out water they wash down the fish and uh you catch that white bass and crappie out of there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um
 	
 	
 		every once in a while there'll be striped bass
 	
 	
 		we have uh some friends who live on a lake and it the lake it just seems is is completely filled with bass to the point where you know normally you go you you go fishing for bass you get a lot of sunfish or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		or cat or whatever and some other strange stuff but in this particular lake we went out with some friends once and we just every time you tossed the line in you pull up a five six seven inch minimum bass and usually you pull up you know thirteen to fourteen inch bass
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a real it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just we pull up you know bass after bass and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		during perch season as well you pull up a lot of
 		uh probably during during perch season the perch will run in very large schools so what they'll do is just you'll you'll be sort of boating around these people own a little row boat and they'll be boating around and they'll hit a they'll hit a school of perches in the middle
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and when they do you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at they they just drop it in they they can't pull it in fast enough
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what do you what do you catch perch on
 	
 	
 		um i they actually
 		they according to them you can catch when the perch are running you can catch them on just about anything
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		they tend to use i guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes but you know i've she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they'll corn or salami or bread or anything they'll they'll they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded these large schools
 	
 	
 		yeah it's sometimes i use corn but uh uh some fish steal it off the hook sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a big problem
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 		the other day i was fishing with bread uh there's a college across the street and they it's it's full of carp
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh i caught a carp on a about what size is that uh i think it was a number two treble hook and it's huge its its mouth was just full of hooks
 	
 	
 		um
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so he was in a bad way but uh it's he was fast
 	
 	
 		a big one
 	
 	
 		he's uh yeah well it's uh it was sixteen inches long
 	
 	
 		wow that's that's that's a nice size carp
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it was about a pound and a half you know but all they're good for is the fight boy they don't they really don't want to come out of the water they they zip through the water you know you're how your line goes you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i thought you know that uh i wasn't going to be able to get it in because uh the one i hooked just about ten minutes before when when i tried to raise it out of the water it fell off
 		so it wasn't hooked very well but you know i got it that far i figured that uh
 	
 	
 		that that that counts
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what i said that's what i told the guy the guy was standing there and he laughed when it fell off  and i said that's a quick release right there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do you do you do you actually like the taste of fish do you like eat the fish that you catch or are you more of a sport fisherman
 	
 	
 		um catfish yeah but uh i haven't eaten anything else you know
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		um there's some uh my dad has a farm and there's he has two ponds up there and my uncle has a a pond upstream and there's a lot of crappie in there now
 		but uh i think he's the only one that's that's caught enough crappie or a big enough crappie to eat but the catfish there's you know there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and
 	
 	
 		right so you can just
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh because i don't actually like fish it's sort of so when i fish it's more for sport than anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah and if you know when you when you have to look in their eyes and you know hit them in the head or whatever that's what you do with a catfish you know because you have to sever their spinal cord
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 		and and and and and be careful you don't get stung
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i know it have you ever tried uh deep sea fishing
 	
 	
 		uh not yet my brother went off the coast of Maine uh when the i don't know what they Mackerel that school out there it's he he said that it was just like that  they were throwing like uh uh hell benders or uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh some other kind of treble hook lure and and uh each time they bring them in they'd have at least one sometimes they've had two on you know one on every hook
 	
 	
 		yeah we i was out in  Florida with a friend
 		a while ago and we would go and just uh drop two you know a a two or three rig two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat we just dropped it down there and
 		the captain had you know some kind of sonar in the boat so he'd maneuver us in into a school of fish and you just drop it in and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it just you you get one or two at a shot you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a good deal too it was it was a like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		you know and and and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want
 	
 	
 		yeah down here it's like two hundred dollars a day
 	
 	
 		well this is yeah this this this was for a you know large there were
 	
 	
 		a group party
 	
 	
 		maybe thirty of us on the boat we we weren't all related just you know thirty people off the shop in the boat there if you want to go on a boat alone it's like two hundred dollars a day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but this is great because it was i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know so you'd get to go out there for five for for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and and fish all day it's really nice
 		it's real enjoyable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i i don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not
 	
 	
 		i think we're probably close though
 	
 	
 		yeah it's nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		nice talking to you too good luck with fishing this season
 	
 	
 		good luck bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye-bye
