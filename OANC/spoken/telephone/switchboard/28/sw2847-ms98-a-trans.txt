 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		tell me what books you read
 	
 	
 		oh boy well um i haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately i read uh one book a friend recommended to me i can't even remember the guy's name it was a science fiction Dean
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Cole or something like that and it was so frightening and it had so much violence in it i just  could hardly stand it yeah i didn't think it was so great she thought it was riveting you know but i couldn't deal with that but um
 	
 	
 		um i try to avoid the
 	
 	
 		mostly i read i'm a marriage and family counselor and mostly i read things to do with raising kids and now i have two little kids or codependency or you know fifty thousand things like John Bradshaw's books on uh The Family and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Homecoming and Inner Child and so i read usually that kind of stuff if and right now i'm reading um Judith Viorst's book called Necessary Losses where she talks about different losses that we've had in our lives that we have to get past if we're going to mature and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so in my in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old i i read  yes that's really changed my reading habits because i used to read so much especially when i was in school
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that does cut into your reading time a lot
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know but gosh it's uh it's getting pathetic now if i get through a magazine i've been
 	
 	
 		well my my kids are up and out of the house now so you know i'll uh encourage you that you do get uh a little more time to yourself later on  i won't say lots
 	
 	
 		yeah later you're probably looking for your kids so you can  talk to them when they're out running around with friends  yeah what do you read
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		oh uh well i read for a living uh i'm an editor
 	
 	
 		you do oh oh how interesting what kind of books
 	
 	
 		and so i i'm at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and therefore i read uh psychology sociology anthropology political science philosophy linguistics history uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		yeah and you name it i've read some of it
 	
 	
 		yeah well that sounds like a fascinating job
 	
 	
 		it really is it it's a great place to be and the uh it's nice to work with people uh who
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		are not required to use your services and so therefore are grateful and not arguing you with you about them if they don't want an editor they don't come
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true that's true well you probably i i seem to remember that uh little byline on a lot of things i've read um is is is that um do they have a mail
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hum
 	
 	
 		kind of campaign that they send to professionals in the social no
 	
 	
 		no we don't uh normally we don't publish uh things under our own imprint uh
 	
 	
 		hum that sounds so familiar
 	
 	
 		we have had books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different uh commercial and academic publishers and university presses
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh i end up sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through sometimes just a few chapters because that's as far as they get
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i also get of course lots of references to neat stuff to read about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm uh i was just thinking when they told me the topic i should just i should read the uh titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that i'm in the middle of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm reading uh Within the Plantation Household which is a history uh sort of a sociological history of southern women black and white living on plantations
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds interesting yeah
 	
 	
 		uh a book called Poisons of the Past which is about ergotisms that uh fungus that grows on rye
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it causes the uh uh Saint Anthony's Fire Disease where people fell into fits and
 	
 	
 		i thought that was going to be some
 		oh
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		there is a a theory at least that a lot of people who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of ergot
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and a book called Job Cues Gender Cues which explains
 		uh how certain professions and vocations get uh flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other like uh nursing
 	
 	
 		um-hum nursing or
 	
 	
 		started out all men and then in the nineteenth century began to have women and now it's practically all women
 	
 	
 		yeah secretaries i bet that used to be mostly men who were secretaries of any type for business
 	
 	
 		and that uh
 		that's right and the thing that changed that was the manual typewriter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but then it became you see just sort of a clerical task whereas when you wrote it out in long hand you were a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		then you were important
 	
 	
 		yes you were a confidential assistant to the person
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah like the scribes who did the old documents you know for churches and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and stuff yeah that's interesting
 	
 	
 		and then i've got a book called Fashions in Science which is a sociology that explains uh why certain theories get to be popular in uh sociology and
 		uh how difficult it is to swim against the tide if you have a different idea that isn't vatted by your peers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then i have one novel that's called First Light that's about uh archeology
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		the British novel so it's it's really quite interesting i haven't got too far into it yet
 	
 	
 		gosh really
 		so are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts that have not been published
 	
 	
 		uh those are all books that are out uh published and bound now but they're just things that
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh pertain to various things i'm working on or were uh mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity so i got them out of the library and decided i'd read some more in them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		my goodness well that's fascinating gosh
 	
 	
 		so i read a lot of history and uh a few novels an occasional mystery stories just for fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah yeah i never have gotten into any of the romantic novels or any of that kind of stuff my husband reads a lot of the um well he did before we had kids the Star Trek and all those kind of sci-fi kinds of things you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you really he's got a quite a collection of those but uh
 		my stuff revolves uh revolves revolves around uh one hundred one thousand let's see i've got one called One Thousands Practical Parenting Tips which teaches you to put elastic instead of shoelaces in your kid's shoes hey i've done that to every pair my three year old has
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh hey that's a nifty idea
 		great
 	
 	
 		you know really and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i think the the boom to parents and the the shoelace department was those little Velcro tabs i think that's inc redibly
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah but there's a surprising number that are still around that aren't that don't have those so that's an alternate means of dealing with  but um i'm trying to think of what else i've got uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		since i'm um a therapist and all i've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups so i've got all the different alcoholics what they call the blue the blue book the big book
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and all the OA literature and all the CODA literature so i'm trying to get familiarized more familiarized with that because i refer clients and different groups and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well let's see i'm trying to think of the
 	
 	
 		what do you think is the most promising or practical book uh of that kind yo u've read recently
 	
 	
 		um oh i definitely i have a a love affair with John Bradshaw i just have found everything i've read of his to be fabulous
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		um he started out with one called The Family which does the family systems and people's roles in the family and then he did uh Healing Healing the Shame that Binds You
 		about how shame can just be so paralyzing and people isolate and withdraw and then the third one that he came out with is now called Homecoming uh and uh there's a subtitle to it i never can remember what it is it's something like um A Journey
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		In Your Inner Child or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i knew his literary agent in Houston when she was just uh convincing him to write all this down he was teaching
 	
 	
 		oh he's just great and now he's had the the first the first one and the third one put into a ten session uh PBS series
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw i saw one of those episodes on PBS uh from time to time out here we have four different PBS channels that we can get on the cable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and they'll have all ten of those shown back to back in the middle of the night for people can video tape them
 	
 	
 		i know yeah so people can just tape them i guess you know  but i definitely have gotten a lot out of his lately he's just probably been one of the most there's an author that's in um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's in uh Arizona who used to be in Dallas it seems like we have a lot of these that have been in Texas called PM Melody who does a lot of writing on codependency and she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		a workbook called Breaking Free and just some real uh helpful practical things for codependency so that's been another one that i've thought was real helpful but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		other than that uh my reading centers on Paddington Bear and  Winnie the Pooh and  Doctor Seuss
 	
 	
 		oh yes  oh
 	
 	
 		but i really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so much more uh new things out that you know i i'd pull out the classics once in a while for my kids but there's such cute things out for kids
 	
 	
 		oh there's some absolutely wonderful illustrated children's books
 	
 	
 		oh i know and i just go to the library because i just they're expensive i mean it and they go through them so fast you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i just i really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out and they just love to sit and read and now finally the littlest one is old enough to to sit you know and watch the pictures instead of grabbing it and trying to rip the pages out
 	
 	
 		exactly right uh well
 	
 	
 		so that has been fun to do that you know go through the children's literature and uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i read the Publisher's Weekly uh which lists all the upcoming books forthcoming books and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful but i was tickled to see that some publisher is uh reprinting those the James Thurber books for children
 	
 	
 		oh wonderful
 	
 	
 		the Wonderful O and The Thirteen Clocks that have been out of print for about oh i think about twenty years
 	
 	
 		gosh really well i'm going to have to look for those yeah
 	
 	
 		well i had those for my kids and they really did enjoy them
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh but they were old copies then i didn't buy them when my kids were little and so they probably were out of print all of already when my kids were small but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um i was really happy to see that yeah i guess it's in honor of his hundredth
