 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		current events are uh sometimes hard to keep up with there've been several days when i've been busy doing one thing or the other and don't catch the news on the TV or don't get around to a paper
 	
 	
 		um-hum huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's it takes a little bit of time to stay up on things i kind of prefer
 	
 	
 		uh uh
 	
 	
 		uh if i want to know something about a given topic uh about some some major event that's going on i kind of prefer to go to the public television route uh watch some of the the longer exposes on the given topic it's
 	
 	
 		yes like the Lehrer News Hour or something yeah i think that's that's helpful i think that's right
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i i i listen to the evening news you know to get the kind of thumbnail things but i try to read the paper each day uh covering the
 		the headlines and then the in each of the sections and then i think i enjoy the editorials about as much as anything
 	
 	
 		hm yeah
 		that's uh editorials give you uh an insight into people's perspective of of issues better than you know it's really funny to look at somebody and say well i never really thought of it that way how could they think that way you know an
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah that's right that's right or or to help you understand really how you think i think sometimes
 		um we're very divided about about our feelings about things and uh sometimes the editor will help me focus
 		uh you know somebody who's thought about it at great length in order to write something about it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		usually has a kind of an uh an approach that maybe i hadn't quite considered
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i find them very interesting and helpful i think to uh settling my mind about things
 	
 	
 		right the uh radio has become uh a new tool that i started using lately i'd had it on the local KRLD for a long time but now uh
 	
 	
 		plus
 	
 	
 		with uh CNN a station broadcasting CNN's headline news just the audio portion of it it's a good little clip in the morning i can catch ten fifteen minutes of that to cover it covers the morning real well
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah i think
 		yeah i used to listen a lots when i drove but i don't i have eye problems and i don't drive now and i i don't listen to the radio very much just because i don't i'm not where it is
 	
 	
 		yeah i i keep one in most every room and i end up uh the mornings in the bathroom during the shower and the like i can pretty well cover that twenty minute segment that CNN does in the morning
 	
 	
 		uh that's a good idea
 		yeah that's a good idea
 	
 	
 		and they if you leave out the sports you can really get everything in about ten minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they cover uh most of the nations events especially during the war time as it was going on they keep me up to date on how my brother-in-law was doing over there and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it was nice to hear the the what plane had and hadn't crashed because he was flying them and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the bias though that i find uh kind of another topic the the bias that i find in some of the coverages it's kind of hard on oh let's say it's a major issues to get uh an unbiased opinion
 	
 	
 		i think so too
 	
 	
 		uh you just happen to have a type of person that gravitates toward that that profession then you end up with a hierarchy in that profession that won't promote someone with a a uh different point of view so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		different point of view yeah i think you have to be very careful in it with the media in that for that reason because they they are not because they are very biased
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		most of them have very biased feelings it's hard to hard to get one i'll tell you the the we take the Insight magazine and i find it to be as uh about as unbiased as any i've found
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah that's nice to have anything that'll show both sides to something and uh try their best to dedicate you know equal space here and there for an issue
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but you know the funny thing the history of newspapers uh i was kind of amazed uh not being a real historian buff i
 		i listened to a program one time on uh i believe it was Larry King Live was had an old newspaper guy on there and he was saying that uh
 		the history of newspapers were to be a hundred percent biased that's all they were were that guys opinion he owned the press and he could say what he wanted and he got politicians in office and he did everything he wanted to
 		and people knew it people knew that you know this person put out this kind of print and that's what they said that's what they felt
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and then they slowly you you know out of public cry changed a little bit toward being a little more unbiased
 	
 	
 		hm that's interesting
 	
 	
 		but that their origin was uh a hundred percent you know i want to present this view and that's what the newspaper did along with a few other tidbits of obituaries and pure factual things
 	
 	
 		to be biased
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the majority of comment was sheerly sheerly editorial and and had bold faced lies in print just to get the point across you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		isn't that interesting
 	
 	
 		and uh he was he was giving the history of several politicians that were made made and broken by that uh process there
 		and i i
 	
 	
 		kind of a sad commentary though when you think about it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that uh that that kind of power was was was at one time flourishing in this country
 	
 	
 		it is
 		right right and it's it's such a valuable tool and and their should be some moral
 		uh you know there's so many people to be duped
 	
 	
 		yes yes there's still a lot of people that believe if it's in print it's gospel
 	
 	
 		yes yeah that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		that's too bad really
 	
 	
 		yeah it is it's kind of uh TV they mentioned TV radio and newspaper as just uh
 		uh and then friends and the like i still get a little bit of my information from magazines uh especially if it's a technical nature and professional nature as it were
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh if you're going to catch up on what the latest developments are mechanical design wise or car wise or anything like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's true that's good source of really good information usually
 	
 	
 		and i guess the housekeeping realm still gets its main articles from the Good Housekeeping style magazines
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think that's right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i think that's true
 	
 	
 		especially as fast as they can print these things these days some of my stuff comes every two weeks and then it's a lot of material
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 		well that's true be awful if you couldn't read isn't it i've i've learned to appreciate that i've had some eye problems in the last four or five years and there are times when i couldn't read for one reason or another and it's a real it's a it's awful
 	
 	
 		yes that's true
 	
 	
 		the so the printed the printed or whatever word is really a valuable thing to us even though sometimes it may be slanted i think you need to learn to think and understand that you have to interpret
 		and stand up for yourself decide what you think and
 		make decisions
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i'm calling here from work and i've got another call coming in so i'd better let you go okay bye
 	
 	
 		all right good to talk to you um-hum bye now
