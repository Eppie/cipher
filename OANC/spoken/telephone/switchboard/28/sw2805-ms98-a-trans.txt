 
     		
 	
 		all right um
 		what kind of recent camping experience do you have
 	
 	
 		well there are several things that we've done as a family um
 		as far as uh when we go on vacation we have four children  and so it's difficult sometimes for us to afford the hotel all the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so we take our tent and we pitch it and our kids are just great at camping my husband and my son are scouts
 		and are very adept at that kind of thing and so it makes it a successful thing you know we just pitch the tent and we find the campgrounds that have facilities which is really nice because there are a lot of them across the United States now
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um
 		and uh uh like i said our kids are just really good and we have a four year old and even he's not any big problem with it
 	
 	
 		oh that's good yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i think it's uh it's a lot of fun uh
 		my camping experiences have been mostly with my son who was in the scouts he's he's huh he thinks he's an adult now but uh we started camping with the cub scouts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh camped uh you know for several years with the with the Boy Scouts and and went to some of the scout uh camp sites around
 		and we've had really had a good time uh
 	
 	
 		they're nice too
 	
 	
 		with that
 	
 	
 		yeah um and i was a den mother for a while too and uh like they have a thing called Mom and Me and that's right you'd go out with them even the mothers do and camp over night
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		but uh
 		our first uh first camping experience was uh the fathers took the the uh Webelows i guess it was camping uh and we went over to uh a lake over in East Texas
 		and we my son and i borrowed a one of these pop up trailer tents
 	
 	
 		oh how fun
 	
 	
 		and it rained it started raining about the time we left home and it rained
 		uh like that was a Saturday morning and it rained all day Saturday and it was still raining Sunday morning we went over and set up camp and you know stayed there over night
 		we couldn't do anything so as soon as we woke up Sunday morning we you know we had breakfast and then we all came back home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i think he and i were the only ones that stayed high and dry so to speak
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		most of the most of our camping experiences have been you know pup tent type of you know little two men tents on the ground and sleeping in a bed roll you know and that kind of thing so it's uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		we did have a really bad experience uh we went to Corpus Christi one year and um
 		while we were there we  uh had camped on kind of a sandy ground area instead of uh the hard firm uh dirt ground
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and in the night there came a very um windy type weather and it blew our stakes out and and the the tent fell
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that that that's always bad when the tent falls on you in the middle of the night
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah so that wasn't too exciting but good experience for us to know that we definitely didn't needed to do the stakes into a firm ground
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah you need to be on higher ground sometime you don't want the if there if it's going to rain you don't want the water to run down into your tents so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		but uh yeah we had we've had some really good experiences it it's been several years since i've been camping but uh as a matter of fact my son uh is camping now he camps every weekend he
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh how fun
 	
 	
 		he's uh involved with the uh Scarborough Fair down at Waxahachie and he goes down there on uh Saturday on uh Friday night
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and camps and stays uh Friday night and Saturday night and then comes back home after it closes Sunday
 	
 	
 		and stays so
 	
 	
 		so he has a tent that's i guess he's got a permanent tent site for his tent stays down there all week you know and he just goes down and spends the weekend down there
 	
 	
 		well that sounds great
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so he's really having a good time camping and and you know his experiences that he got from scouting have really you know been good for him uh from that he he lost interest in scouts but he still uses what he learned so
 	
 	
 		see that's that's very nice
 		the only thing i think about camping is when you have to cook outdoors and you don't always have to do that but um we have a dutch oven and and we found some really fun recipes that we can do in that that are quite tasteful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		you know you uh do you do the cooking in the coals where you wrap everything in foil and
 	
 	
 		we've done that before uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but yeah that's we uh my my wife and i took the uh the scout leadership training program
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we really had a good time with that we did have a uh
 		i guess it was a raccoon that came into our campsite and stole some of the food you know that we didn't have set up i think it actually went into the tent with uh with a couple of ladies that were in our group you know went in an and got stuff out of their tent
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		oh jeepers
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but they uh you know it was uh it was a fun time and we we've enjoyed camping what you know what little we've done uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we're not
 	
 	
 		well i think camping is one of those things that you can make memories with so  i think it's a wonderful activity and it's just
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		we uh
 		we went uh one time one time with a uh another group or with the the scouting group but it was the parents uh you know it was a family camp out
 		and one of the things was that uh the uh we had uh uh a couple that were uh from India
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and they demonstrated cooking some Indian food out you know on a on a little gas burner type thing out there you know it was part of our our entertainment you know for the thing they cooked some kind of uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		of an Indian uh pastry type thing on a in a skillet skillet you know so it was really it was really interesting we went to uh
 		down to Glen Rose to the uh where the dinosaur tracks are and there's a campsite you know down there in that area that we uh that we went to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well i'm from Utah and before we moved to Texas and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i see the different kinds of camping there are you know like the mountain camping and then here it's mostly flat land
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i'm not sure which i like better it's kind of nice to be on flat land but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah right
 		well yes
 	
 	
 		but i think you get a more scenic type thing in there so
 	
 	
 		right yeah so if you haven't camped down around at that place down around Glen Rose you might enjoy that uh it's you know it's got some it's got some hills and stuff down there so
 	
 	
 		no i don't think we've ever gone there
 		oh that sounds nice
 	
 	
 		yeah but uh yeah you know well i've enjoyed i t and uh make you make me want to go camping again you know okay thanks
 	
 	
 		well thank you
 		i've enjoyed talking to you
 		well go go go  have a good day um bye-bye
 	
 	
 		you too bye-bye
