 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		yeah so um what do you feel about the universal health insurance issue
 	
 	
 		well well i'm i'm not really very much in favor of it at all uh i i feel like uh the the government gets involved in in a little bit too much of our life anyway
 		and health insurance is is one thing that i'm i'm not sure that they have the expertise to
 		to run it anyway and i i just kind i kind of feel like like i say we've got too much government already
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i guess my my initial reaction would be that that i would be for it mainly from the standpoint that that i find um my health insurance not very effective and very expensive
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so i you know am am probably being very naive i'm hoping that that by by centralizing it it might get better and be cheaper
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess i i i i guess my my my my own opinion of of uh government programs in general  especially those that
 		are centralized type you know centralizing type of programs i have not seen one yet that that that i i felt like really worked the way it should
 		i think that uh the private sector has uh a lot more expertise available and has the incentives to make a program work whereas a a bureaucracy
 		uh people that work in in a bureaucracy are just there to keep the bureaucracy going
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so uh i'm
 	
 	
 		what about uh things like in Sweden isn't isn't that sort of a centralized or in lots of places in Europe
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess uh uh like i said i i i don't really know that much about it i i've uh uh mine may be more prejudice than opinion you know i i guess i've got uh
 		uh prejudice against the government you you know uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i feel like i feel like too much government is too much government
 	
 	
 		right i you know i guess i can certainly agree with that
 		but um
 		you know like i said i feel i'm being uh being stung every time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i know that uh the British like i say i know i understand that the British system uh which is you know centralized medical program
 		does not work very well or at least the people are not real real happy with it
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and and uh i i that's my understanding anyway
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum yeah i knew they had one but i just i guess i assumed it worked which is is uh not a good
 	
 	
 		and uh you know
 		yeah
 		yeah you know when when you when you read uh uh uh see the some of the articles or or watch in particular watch some of the British made television shows
 		you get the impression that it's it's more or less a joke uh you know a lot of people use it because they don't have an alternative uh an affordable affordable alternative
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but they're you know they still it doesn't work very well i know in here in Texas in in the Dallas area we have a uh a county run hospital
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know the county furnishes the hospital and people that don't have uh access to to insurance and stuff are able to go to that hospital
 		but if you go there if you're you know if you've got an emergency you have to be almost dead before you can get in like you know in a timely manner because there are so many people sitting there waiting all the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for medical services that you know if you may be there five or six hours you know for just normal treatment
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and  i guess i'm not uh i'm not too keen on having to go to a to a some kind of a location like that on on a routine basis
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum maybe i don't know much about HMO's but my impression is maybe maybe some uh HMO's are sort of a low form of centralization
 	
 	
 		well i guess uh to some extent uh an HMO i i have been involved have have been a member of an HMO before for a short period of time and and that did work very well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it was you know the company it was a company sponsored plan and and it it is you know individual doctors that do own or have a you know have a a shareholders in an HMO
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so it's not  i i guess uh it's not a it's not a government run operation and that's that's you know that's my main objection i you know i don't care how they finance it
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know  they could they could put a tax on me and say this is for medical insurance and then hire a you know some kind of private company that's not run by a government
 		to you know to run the program
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and that might work but
 		if it's if it's going to be run you know and supervised
 		at at at a government level by a bureaucratic type you know operation
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i don't think it's going to work myself
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i do i do think that we're headed that way i think that there's a strong possibility that in in my lifetime i will see
 		uh you know  see one
 		in operation so
 	
 	
 		um-hum is that because of of the the cost or or government wants it you think
 	
 	
 		well i think i think that uh i think there only
 		that want it uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think the government
 		will respond you know to
 		when i say a lot of people i'm not saying a majority of people but i think the government will respond to that group that does want it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know so
 		you know you know i guess i i
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		i'm a i'm a pessimist in that in that respect
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well but that's interesting because you know it's it's i don't know that much about it but my initial response would be more favorable and and perhaps i need to to learn more about it so that i'm not so naive on it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well i guess and and and and perhaps mine too you know perhaps i i need to know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have stronger arguments for why are are or find out the the arguments in favor of you know so but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but that's i guess that's  i had not thought about before so
 	
 	
 		right well it was nice talking to you okay okay um um-hum bye-bye
 	
 	
 		yeah it was nice talking to you too okay thanks
 		bye
