 
     		
 	
 		are you still there okay it worked that time okay
 	
 	
 		yes
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well we just ate out um had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late and we had Italian um have you ever been to the Olive Garden
 	
 	
 		no i haven't is that good
 	
 	
 		it yeah well
 		do you really like Italian food
 	
 	
 		it's it's not my favorite but i like it okay
 	
 	
 		then don't
 		then then this'll probably be i mean this isn't really excellent Italian food that sounds terrible to tell you go go somewhere where it's not that great but it's um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you're not going to believe this i have to tell you this if i don't because you're in Plano that
 	
 	
 		that's okay
 	
 	
 		but my um  unit here  is acting like he's dying of tramane poison  it wasn't that bad  actually it's very good it's all the um for for run adult males
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which i'm not Italian no it's uh it's all the garlic bread and all the uh salads you can eat with uh an entree
 	
 	
 		oh oh oh that sounds really good
 	
 	
 		so it wasn't too bad it really wasn't but i was more in the mood for French toast anyway so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but i really like Italian food though but do you have any favorite
 	
 	
 		well are there just the two of you
 	
 	
 		uh yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay well when my husband and i go out we have four children so that makes a difference for us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		but we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and and feed the whole family like that
 	
 	
 		yeah and you can usually get a variety of what you're looking for like at Gatti's or something like that
 	
 	
 		right
 		right but when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere and we usually head on down um oh what's the freeway down here
 	
 	
 		uh six thirty five uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and there are um all along that that freeway there are are restaurants but one of our favorites is Pappasito's
 	
 	
 		oh yeah Pappasito's we went there on my birthday in March it's great
 	
 	
 		no we love to go there yeah
 		you know it always kills me because i don't like the the decorations so much it's too
 	
 	
 		too much like a bar naturally and Mexico yeah i know i've seen it
 	
 	
 		yeah but i love the food i love the food they just are great
 	
 	
 		the food is probably i'm not a i'm i'm not a Mexican food gourmet by any means but it's probably the best tasting i i don't know if it would you classify that as Tex-Mex
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		um the shredded beef the the type of spices or sauces they use
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh i like to get uh uh a shrimp uh it's a shrimp dish and i don't remember the name of it but it's rolled up into into something and it oh it's really good that's good
 	
 	
 		every every
 		really
 		uh-huh
 		i've never had anything there that wasn't delicious even
 	
 	
 		yeah they really good
 	
 	
 		even though you have to stand in line and all that that's the only thing i don't like about it too it's a little bit with the the meat market atmosphere you know even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to um be around not to be around that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i'm trying to think of what else we like to eat the one thing i notice it's it's just um about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt i mean we find it prohibited just the cost anymore
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah it's very expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah and i don't know how you feel about that but i think some of it's over priced
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		i'm glad i'm talking about food normally these conversations are
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a
 	
 	
 		yeah it is i don't know um
 	
 	
 		no sometimes Mark and i that's my husband Mark uh go to the August Moon which is down there it's a Chinese uh restaurant with the lions in the front
 	
 	
 		um-hum uh-huh
 		oh yeah my husband likes that yeah off of Arapaho down there yeah August Moon uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh it's pretty good as far as Chinese food goes but uh Chinese isn't my favorite so
 	
 	
 		i don't like it at all usually so
 	
 	
 		but he likes it kind of so he says that's a good place now me i'm i'm like i said seafood i'm i like that
 	
 	
 		yeah i love seafood and i i like a lot of different ethnic foods i like Japanese food there's a place on Greenville um called Sagar's
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um
 	
 	
 		well we haven't been in years down near Presby and i had a meeting down there today and i saw that and i i said gee i remember that they offer you um authentic Japanese feeding or American or piano bar
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and i remember when we went  we were married with another couple that was just dating and um i had never had sake  it made all the raw fish taste great
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but if you're ever looking for a very uh it's very pretty inside and the girls wear kimonos and you know if you're ever looking for that um but what other kind of foods gee i don't know um we went to a place called Grishman's in Greenville
 	
 	
 		is it oh how nice
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which was really over priced
 	
 	
 		i don't know that's
 		was it
 	
 	
 		um-hum but great desert bar
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um  that's what we need isn't it no there's lots of nice barbecue places here now i like barbecue okay Texas barbecue and that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i like barbecue have you ever been to the i think it's called Spring Creek Barbecue yeah they have pretty good food yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah now they're real good yeah they're good
 	
 	
 		there had oh and my husband's going upstairs and he said and free ice cream  i didn't know they had that oh i can't talk i had chocolate Bavarian tort for desert today which i never eat at lunch and it was wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah free ice cream yeah
 		oh
 		is to die for i bet ooh
 	
 	
 		it was yeah in fact if i could pick my um restaurants on how their coffee is and how their French bread is and the butter and the desert i would be
 	
 	
 		in heaven
 	
 	
 		yes i would be in hog heaven and how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want or do you still order for them or
 	
 	
 		well my two littlest i just had a baby and she's six months and then my four year old he he still but my other two older two they can so they're they're they're
 	
 	
 		oh congratulations
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they're kind of my my littlest girl she's still like wants McDonald's McDonald's McDonald's
 	
 	
 		yeah everybody every child that i even know that eats vegetables um  below below five years old still after a certain age realize that there is something called McDonald's
 	
 	
 		oh i'm telling you
 	
 	
 		it's really sad isn't it because it's hard to get them away from junk then
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of funny is sometimes we're like we all want different things and so there's a Fifteenth Avenue down here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i know where that yeah
 	
 	
 		and along that street are all these fast food restaurants so we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing and then we go to a park over there so we can all have our own that's on the nights we can't decide
 	
 	
 		right that's all
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		well that's all right as long as that i was going to say because with six people how do you um with two we have a problem
 		i mean i can't even imagine you know trying to uh you sound like you're doing pretty well there with four children
 	
 	
 		well i love them they're good kids
 	
 	
 		that's the way to yeah well we're getting ready to i shouldn't say this on this conversation but it's just on my mind we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt
 	
 	
 		so
 		oh how nice
 	
 	
 		yeah we're excited
 	
 	
 		it'll be neat
 	
 	
 		i think it'll be worth it and somebody said to me in terms of  this is food so i can say this but they said you have to bring the formula and i said what's that
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they laughed and i said well you know
 	
 	
 		uh food's food
 	
 	
 		i'm thirty something and i and i said is that what makes them drool anyway you know i guess it are you is it a little bit constricted because a lot of restaurants don't take in terms of talking about restaurants i mean are a lot of restaurants
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		how are they when you have children let alone three or four children
 	
 	
 		you have to be careful if you go to a a restaurant that that really is more adult you know with the atmosphere and everything they if you're like we could probably take our oldest son and our oldest daughter
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they know how to act i don't i don't think i'd chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a distraction and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the yuppie kind of crowd yeah yeah i just i just i've been in some places where they say they take children and then i've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude you know and that always just bothered me um
 	
 	
 		what yeah
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves  i don't know what other kind of restaurants really Pappasito's we love um we went to one Italian back on the Italian we went to some place across from Collin Creek Mall
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it was absolutely putrid for Italian food i can't remember the name of it it's on um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		is it Tia's not Tia's um
 	
 	
 		i can't yeah no that's Mexican um it's right across from on the Dillard's side there or Folley's
 	
 	
 		yeah i know which one it is and i can't think of it
 	
 	
 		i can't it's in the strip yeah and it it had white tablecloth i think it was like paper where you could write on them or something with crayons and it was just terrible
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		i mean i was shocked i mean the dish was dirty um
 	
 	
 		it's one of those ones you have a bad experience and say i don't think i'll come back here
 	
 	
 		yeah where you felt like you were
 		right like you're in a bad part of Italy Italy or something
 	
 	
 		yeah oh dear oh
 	
 	
 		um boy but other than that i don't know we we do our share of pizza eating too
 		but it's more like uh go get it and carry it in because we're too cheap to pay the delivery  and i don't like strange people coming to my door um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah yeah yeah
 		well i i've about said what what what my favorites were and i can't really think of any other uh
 	
 	
 		me too
 		no except it just makes me fat no i'm just kidding but you can
 	
 	
 		places
 		uh yeah you have to watch it if you go out to eat that's true
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true but you can always blame it on having children no
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah there you go
 	
 	
 		well i enjoyed talking to you and i guess you know
 	
 	
 		well good luck
 	
 	
 		maybe we'll see you in the restaurants somewhere okay uh-huh bye bye-bye
 	
 	
 		yeah maybe okay bye-bye
