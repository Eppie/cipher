 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay well i heard Dallas is pretty bad with the crime
 	
 	
 		well you know you last night i was listening to the uh ten o'clock news
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings the number of drug deals that were going on and crime and and it's so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore
 	
 	
 		um-hum the same way here in Dennison i mean uh back a couple weeks ago they found uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		some people i don't remember at some fast food restaurant they had been i can't remember if they been shot or if they just been thrown in the freezer but i'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast food restaurant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i've worked in fast food restaurants they don't have that much money on hand they really don't
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i did too i remember used i used to work at uh Kentucky Fried Chicken and uh and i just couldn't believe um you know that now i would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh because of the the crime that they would uh just kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there uh in their cash drawer
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		right my husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he well i don't know he decided not to work one night or something and one of the guys that
 		was working was shot and Kenny quit the next day he just he couldn't deal with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah oh i understand what your talking about
 		so yeah i have uh uh you know a real problem uh even though i live further out in the suburbs the crime follows you anywhere it it doesn't matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		everywhere
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um so but i just think about all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from
 	
 	
 		it just seems like a lot of people are attracted to the bigger cities though the worst part of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i lived in Louisville Kentucky for a while i i lived on the outskirts too but Louisville was pretty bad especially during like the uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		Kentucky Derby at this time of the year it's horrible to live in Louisville
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum um-hum yeah so i don't know um you know it's asking about what kind of steps we can take um
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		uh you know just as citizens to try and um uh protect ourselves i know i have um you know a home security system plus i have the uh the special lights uh on on the outside and i have this
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		the ones that blink off and on for the self i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah that uh
 		yeah yeah by themselves uh if you if there's some kind of movement then they'll automatically come on um but i mean it's just that i constantly think about keeping us safe and protected verses um
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		how many kids do you have
 	
 	
 		two two
 	
 	
 		oh a boy or
 	
 	
 		one of each um-hum yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh that's what i've got it is scary are your babies are they babies or
 	
 	
 		no no they're teenagers now
 	
 	
 		oh well good that they're a comfort to you i've still got babies i've got
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i've got a four a four year old he'll be four and a three month old and it's scary  sometimes
 	
 	
 		oh wow yes that's a problem yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm used to living in uh which we don't live in the city but we just
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's still more crowded than what i'm used to i'm used to having you know eight or ten houses on one street and this one's got houses on either side and you know real close together and just
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's different yeah living down here now now the nice thing uh i feel a little bit more comfort since we're so close together like this um
 		uh i feel like that there's going to be uh less crime or your neighbors going to be watching out for you um because it's it's practically it's in their backyard too
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh oh well we think our neighbors are stealing from us actually my husband
 		they uh
 		well the one of them's a teenager lives next door and her friends are pretty wild
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they've stolen gas out of our vehicles and well he went and got a locking gas cap for his they weren't stealing it out of mine so much because my car the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to siphon gas out
 	
 	
 		oh goodness
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so he went he went and got a locking gas cap and they cut tried to break that off he
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he went down to Uba and noticed that it was hanging off where they had tried to break it off and they stole our tailgate off his truck
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh goodness
 	
 	
 		well we can't say they did but
 	
 	
 		someone did yeah
 	
 	
 		we're pretty yeah
 		it had to be somebody that you know could do it in the middle of the night and you know they'd seen it earlier
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum yeah i know that uh it's uh it's a real problem it doesn't matter really where you are anymore it's uh more of a matter of what you the steps that you do to keep yourself safe
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um so that's that's what i try and uh do
 	
 	
 		well the only things that we can do as citizens is you know like those uh watch groups that they'll have walking but they can be dangerous too and i've thought about it you know uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		really uh-huh
 	
 	
 		this isn't like walking around and looking for somebody you can get yourself into trouble
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah you know i was uh going home the other day and i saw um a guy who who looked like he was breaking into a window and i thought gee whiz you know i don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's the he's the person who lives there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh you know and and i was thinking well i need to call the police when i get back home and because it was about oh about four or five blocks from where we live and uh and i thought no you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because i wouldn't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight but anymore you know the crime happens in daylight as it does in at night
 	
 	
 		yeah well i watched it on TV oh i guess last year sometime they'll break in at the day in the daytime and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i hear that you know it if if you lock yourself out of your house and you try to get in your house it'll you give that half the time it takes you to break in uh a professional could break in in in half that time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		in half that time wow and that's so scary so scary you you think you've got yourself all locked in and safe and and uh somebody could break in a nd uh well i have a dog that's the one thing that i like is
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 		uh-huh i'm getting me uh i want a German Shepherd um i don't want any of those ones that will  up the kids but i do want a German Shepherd
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		right
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		because my husband'll leave every once in a while for he works on the railroad and i'm scared here by myself so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah oh yeah so that's another uh we just a little dog now but he is just as vicious as if you know if you if somebody and loud
 	
 	
 		and loud
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and i thought that uh you know we'd have to have a big dog but we don't need a big dog we got this little bitty dog that uh part Dachshunds and part uh Cocker Spaniel and he um he's very protective
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		yeah Cocker Spaniels are loud  well there
 	
 	
 		yeah very protective
 	
 	
 		now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog that's a deterrent because they know that that dog's going to bark
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but it's easy to fool a dog too you know throw them meat or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it's a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		from what i've hear you know saw on TV
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh wow gosh well it was nice talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah it was
 	
 	
 		okay well
 	
 	
 		and uh maybe we'll meet up again alrighty bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
