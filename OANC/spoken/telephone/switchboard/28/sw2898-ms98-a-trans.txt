 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh all right i had to register us in there
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh hopefully you're a basketball fan
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		hopefully you're a basketball fan
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm from Indiana
 	
 	
 		great i'm glad you are i'm not i i i could care about any of it you know  but go ahead i i would like to talk about uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		maybe college basketball i i like to see it
 		uh be more of an amateur sport i'd like to see it turn back to like the Southwest Conference down here i would like to see Texas
 		and all the teams uh since we're supposed to talk about specific teams
 		i would like to see them turn back to
 		where the college player plays for four years and they're not they're not semi pro and just go on and are stolen by the the NBA the the League you know in three years plus i'd like to see them to be true athletes where they're they're taking a regular
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		college course you know i'd like to see they didn't ask that but they're talking about college teams i you know since you're being you can talk for hours go ahead you you you if you like sports go right ahead with this one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um well
 		i know like what you just said um Purdue had to had to uh
 		their best player this years you know averaged twenty points a game they had to make him sit the bench and actually kicked him off the team because um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		his uh grades even though they passed Big Ten standings and they passed you know NC double A they weren't they did not pass um Purdue requirements and so
 	
 	
 		now that's surprising that they uh that they have better requirements that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's what i like to see go ahead i'm all for that
 	
 	
 		and see so he was treated like all the rest of students you know
 	
 	
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		and and so um you know their very best player they probably lost over half their games because
 		you know by twenty twenty points was what he averaged um and so you know he had to sit
 		you know he was kicked off the team and then they've got three players top you know recruiting class this year that are going to have to be
 		well the the prep school they go to before they can play because they aren't smart enough you know it's just sad because i mean Purdue even though they're one of the few schools that really uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		stress academics they're really suffering you know and
 	
 	
 		oh i i agree i i think that that there's a lot of inconsistencies uh
 		uh when some conference uh players come from outside of Texas you know and and play us here uh they're obviously plus practicing sixty hours a week you know and and there's no consistency seems to me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that like Purdue uh uh when they're trying a student athlete is spending so many hours in class he only has twenty twenty five whatever hours he has
 		to spend on practice he should be playing they all should be playing another team that that has about twenty hours to practice a week but uh you there are teams that practices sixty hours a week they're not going to class at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		like
 	
 	
 		i mean that's that's what i mean by semi pro there's too many semi pros in college and and i think they ought to get rid of that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's what happened to this guy i mean he was uh
 		he didn't go to class and so they just said you know you can't make the grades you're going to have to see you later
 	
 	
 		well i'm all for i'm all for the oh baseball has a uh a uh minor league system and i think that the football and basketball they asked us to talk about basketball
 		should you know let let them go have a semi pro team but i think i'd like to see college athletes let's talk about college basketball i like i like that if any basketball that i like i like that i i don't i don't like the pros at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't either it's
 	
 	
 		uh the high scoring there's no defense it seems like and they just kind of score a hundred and twenty five points you know the other team scores hundred twenty two you know and i don't really
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh get much out of that
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 		yeah it is fun to watch some real disciplined teams play in a in college
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i saw Princeton i think it was or Harvard play this year and they're they're like all white and their starting guard had SAT scores of fifteen hundred
 	
 	
 		oh it did
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams because it was like they played so much smarter and more disciplined i don't know if they won very many games but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know their style of play was so much different from some of the teams that just run and gun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i like high school football which again again is is not the subject but that's so much fun to watch because they're they're the the pure amateurs you know and there's no money involved you go to college you don't really know it it loses it somewhere
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh whatever sport it is if they're really putting putting a lot of money in these players let's face it ninety percent are being paid
 		so i'd like to see college basketball and all the other sports go back to being amateurs i i don't care about seeing the best players in the world play i like to see uh the people going to Texas just play and the ones that are in class and and like to see athletes uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh or students students fellow students like myself you know to to play the game i i in fact i like amateur sports i i don't i don't see it has to be i don't think that college football football and or or basketball should have to be semi pro you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's
 	
 	
 		i wish it'd return to the to good old days of the amateur and everybody play that's what i like everybody should play you know
 	
 	
 		i'm kind of racist i guess when i say uh i like to see the white guys do well you know  instead of the run and gun all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah well again i'd just like to see the the true athlete the student true true true student athlete play basketball you know i don't like to see the ones that aren't have no intention of going to class uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and again just picking a school uh Texas uh is
 		is usually not the best team you know because the other teams are i'm sure practice a lot more and uh SMU down here
 	
 	
 		in fact
 	
 	
 		in in footballs been trying to get back uh to having true student student student athletes and and that's what i think is a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		there's just so much pressure on the schools i think to win though you know that
 	
 	
 		to win and get and money yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and you know if it's like if they don't win they don't get any money so it's and and the school suffers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		which is kind of bad but that's just how it always is
 	
 	
 		yeah i always thought that college university
 		was to to for an education and then sports sports of course is part of the education i don't think that sports has to make a lot of money or you do away with it i don't know why they don't keep fencing and all that you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and they seem to be there's articles in the Time magazine and all that about whether it be basketball or anything else if it's not making money then we'll do away with it well that's that's not i thought it was you know so that you give them an education of that particular discipline
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i and i i just think that amateur sports should stay in universities that's where it's at
 		and i i'm sure saddened to see i think it was Wisconsin or somewhere they were getting rid of fencing and a couple of other things i don't know what it was and it just seems so sad to have to only rely on
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		you know college football is that all they're going to have to make money you know plus i didn't think that was the objective was to make money but it seems like it is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh it really is i know there's a lot of pressure on schools to have a winning program
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to get the best athletes so they can keep their seats full
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you went to Indiana University University oh Purdue okay
 	
 	
 		uh Purdue yeah
 	
 	
 		well good uh you're you're a TIer up in Sherman oh very good
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh
 		are you from Dallas area
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'm in the facilities down here down here in Dallas
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess football is the big sport down here isn't it
 	
 	
 		uh certainly high school football and college football but again high high school football uh is just so much fun to watch because uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh you know just not everybody plays of course but they're still uh it's good and it's still you know the kids and there's absolutely no money involved whatsoever and you know they're going to class you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you heard of Damon
 	
 	
 		it it's just real amateur sports
 	
 	
 		have you heard of Damon Bailey
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		the IU uh white guard that plays well last year when he was in high school uh
 	
 	
 		hum-um
 	
 	
 		they drew a crowd of like forty one thousand for the state finals when he played
 	
 	
 		is that right  that's uh i never has been in a basketball uh football game in high school that had that many
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah  so that's uh i mean that's pretty big like he's from Indiana and he plays for Indiana now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		Indiana State  seems to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there the Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd but you know the college the high school games i mean that seems seems to be the big attraction and college
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well my office mate here Earl he he goes to all the Maverick games and he loves that he he would be this would be great question for him uh to talk about basketball like he's got i'm looking at his calendar he's got all over the place uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and he goes to a lot of the Maverick games and everything and but i i i can't get interested at all zero i i listen to him and occasionally i'll watch them on channel eleven
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh gee i can't uh more than five minutes of a basketball game just seems about that's it of uh uh pro anyway uh of
 	
 	
 		yeah seems like you could set the st the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play and then it'd be the same result you know because they they start they shoot so much and then the last
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i'm surprised a little bit when you're talking about basketball how some players work and Mavericks had
 		oh two players this year that they got rid of last year i'll think of them in a minute Perkins Sam Perkins can't think of the other one they're both
 	
 	
 		Tarpley
 		is he one Tarpley
 	
 	
 		pardon me yeah Tarpley and they both left this past year and both of them were on were on play-off teams uh
 		so they they benefitted tremendously by by leaving the Mavericks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and Sam Perkins here uh
 		he's one guy i did follow from think he was in Virginia i can't think of what school he went to but from i guess he's been here about five six seven years in the pros
 		and he was he never quite achieved the you know the super stardom that he had in in in college but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		basketball they have a nice i don't know if you've been down to the sports for Reunion Arena it's really a nice uh certainly the
