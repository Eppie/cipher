 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then i have a five year old daughter and we cut out things
 		kind of you know and color and uh
 		and uh use markers and things like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um how about you
 	
 	
 		um well i used to be more into crafts when i was younger like high school stuff i was in 4H and i did a lot of latch hook made rugs and stuff um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i've learned how to crochet but i don't really know i mean i don't do it that much not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad i'd rather be outside
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		um
 		i used to play trombone
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know if that was a
 		not really
 		i don't play it that much any more but
 		i'd um what else do i do
 		mainly do reading i don't have a lot of crafty type things i do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		what are some other things you like enjoy
 	
 	
 		i don't know my my father is in the in the antique business
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he uh he goes around to garage sales and he buys all kinds of um
 		china and figurines and statues and stuff and um there's some stuff that's really for um uh auto repair it's called J B Weld
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i repaired a a gasoline tank with it once but he mixes colors in it it's an epoxy resin that you mix together
 	
 	
 		oh cool
 	
 	
 		and he makes like the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a a statue that's real small it's like about maybe the hand's about the size of a cricket
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and uh has uh like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out
 		and he was repairing that and uh it came out pretty good it's kind of a kind of a ivory color all over and and uh has some age spots in it and it looked
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know just like it it had been there all the time
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and he fixed some fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them and uh molds that in he had a blue blue bowl a few weeks ago that he he fixed that way
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it worked out real well too
 	
 	
 		do you ever huh
 	
 	
 		and then he and then he um
 		he thatches uh you know those uh thatched chairs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		course that's like that that uh hooking that you were talking about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that takes a lot of time
 	
 	
 		that's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and he used to paint um
 		a long time ago but i think he's stopped pretty much now
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but outside of outside of art class in in school i i stopped doing most of that unless i i mean like he has a computer and i use um the graphics
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um software on that
 		to uh to do figures and to to look at things you know see how they work
 	
 	
 		right
 		that sounds interesting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		does he ever uh refinish furniture or anything like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah sometimes
 		but it's it's not one of my favorite things especially from the vapors and we had uh an entertainment center we did last year
 		uh we bought it at an unfinished uh furniture place
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and sanded it down and uh stained it and then lacquered over it
 	
 	
 		it's pretty time consuming isn't it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		it's good it's nice to have it when you're done i mean looks pretty so
 	
 	
 		um-hum sure is
 	
 	
 		i've done that once but it didn't come out that well
 	
 	
 		did you use a did you use a Zar stain
 	
 	
 		uh i don't remember it was i had my parents buy everything and i ended up it was their table their kitchen table it came out really dark
 	
 	
 		uh
 		they had a um well i saw the commercial on TV and they and uh and the people at the unfinished store recommended it that's called a it's Z A R
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it spreads real evenly and it doesn't dry too fast so it's if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we put we put tung oil on it kind of made it sticky for a while but after it dried out it was you know it was real hard and it was all right
 	
 	
 		i remember  took me a long time it took me like several months or several weeks to do it during the summer and then after i got it done it was pretty dark and ended up not being real smooth looking
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		since since i've moved away they've had it redone so
 		i kind of kind of gave that hobby up real quick
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 		i don't know
 		like i said i like doing a lot of outdoor stuff so
 		but during 4H i mean they really encouraged to do all kinds of crafty stuff which is interesting interesting i like that
