 
     		
 	
 		okay there's there's one  um i'm at living in Texas where you at
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm in Rome New York
 	
 	
 		in where Rome New York Rome New York okay well Texas let me look at my husband and ask him  does Texas have state capital punishment
 	
 	
 		Rome New York yeah
 	
 	
 		yes they do
 		he's reminding me of where i live yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i new New York does not but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they're they're trying to reinstate it and the governor's opposed to it being that uh Democrat that he is uh Mario Cuomo
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it
 	
 	
 		yeah i um i ethically don't like the idea but or i should say morally i don't like the idea but um
 		social ethics ethics and ethics socially and ethically i think it's a good idea
 	
 	
 		i'd i would agree with that they almost even more
 	
 	
 		in certain crimes
 	
 	
 		i don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically but i'm really offended by the thought that i have to support uh just the existence of you know murder rapist whatever  you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		right and any demand on the street no i know
 	
 	
 		right that that uh after they've gone and done horrible things molested children and kill them and whatever that society has to pay uh upwards uh thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah and Texas is having a problem right now and it's the the the the the repeatable crime i think that's the the  repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're they're patrol the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done
 		oh heinous things from calling from uh killing police officers to i mean just multiple you know molestations molestations to murders of children just you know really bad things
 		and they're get these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and now they can't find them and they're finding bodies in ditches you know i mean you think think why they say it's because you're over crowded it's over crowded then you think how can every is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten
 	
 	
 		i
 		i don't know it's a hard question you look at the United States we have the largest murder rate of any developed uh or uh
 	
 	
 		right i know
 		and then and i don't know how Americans are about handguns but uh yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that uh in the state capitol here in Austin Texas
 		they had been uh looking at a bill uh making it easier to accept the bill to access to access handguns and they passed it
 		which basically means without an FBI check any person in this state over twenty one can get a gun
 		
 
 	
 	
 		here in New York it's a lot harder than that uh it takes uh it takes almost six months to get uh handgun permit in this state
 	
 	
 		is it that's good
 		say that good i think that's like the state of Virginia yeah that's great
 	
 	
 		now the the and that's with uh you have to have uh
 		oh a police investigation you have to have references and i know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i know it there is it's very easy to get uh
 		uh you know there's no no restrictions whatsoever on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that which aren't
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the the i i don't consider to be the kind of a a crime uh  weapon you know uh so
 	
 	
 		right they're not the cattiness behind right yeah i mean i don't like guns in general but when i think about uh this topic like capital punishment i look at somebody
 		i mean i just remember when i was in college in a dorm and i think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in Florida in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and how they just executed well it hasn't been just but it was in the i think the second or third quarter of last year nineteen ninety
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad you did you know this had nothing and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but i actually i mean there should be more cases like that where they
 		flip a switch i have and i might be too cold too but they flip a switch i don't know i mean
 	
 	
 		yeah i well
 		and and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped and then
 	
 	
 		so many times
 	
 	
 		yeah and uh did it again and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i mean and that's just maybe because of the little more that they said celebrated that uh he's not the only one you know you you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime there was something on and this gets back to capital punishment
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true and they buried her alive
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh God
 	
 	
 		and Peter Strauss had played the lead role and the man and and the at the end of you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh
 		that's nice
 	
 	
 		great
 	
 	
 		i mean you know i'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence
 		but it does serve as a punishment uh definite punishment you know lasting punishment
 	
 	
 		that sure there's an end to the the situation
 	
 	
 		right in that particular instance um
 		but i but i don't but i know it's not a end all and be all that's the problem i have with it in Texas they think it's an end all and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something else gas somebody
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime ridden and we just moved here uh we've been here before lived in Minneapolis Saint Paul
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh which has an exceedingly low crime rate and then we were transferred back here and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were you really begin to see uh just how problematic
 		just living is even suburban no matter where you are and how you're in Rome New York is that and and is that like near Albany or Syracuse
 	
 	
 		right
 		Rome New York it's up state it
 		it's uh near Syracuse it's about uh well i i actually live in a Village of Sylvan Beach i work in Rome um
 	
 	
 		what what type of area is that is that uh in term
 	
 	
 		it's more rural uh it use to be use to be a uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh have a lot of heavy industry but it's kind of uh all the industry has gone south and uh now the Air Force is the largest employer in the uh area and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh so it's
 	
 	
 		how would how is the situation in there in terms of crime and things that would not too bad
 	
 	
 		not too bad it you know you the still have the um
 		more drug problems and typical uh small city type problems but i don't know that there's a real
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh no there isn't the harsh  crime and all
 	
 	
 		not the harsh criminality
 		that you find in yeah now Dallas is a
 		i'm being very sarcastic it's just a great place um on some days uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's um
 		i don't know the good ole boy network here is uh very strange like i said they believe that if they kill somebody you know
 		tit for tat and deed for deed that that does something uh but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that i mean they really are over crowded i mean that's that's just not a cop out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		um and i just you know i'm originally from Pennsylvania which i think is basically like New York these days i'm not sure if they i don't think they have capital punishment there
 	
 	
 		think
 		think Pennsylvania Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because i'm from uh from Pennsylvania also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		just uh just outside of Philadelphia
 	
 	
 		i'm not trying
 		yeah and i'm from Pittsburgh so oh well we'll forgive each other
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um because they use to be very very conservative when i was growing up i and i can't i haven't lived there in twenty years but um
 	
 	
 		right
 		the west part of the state is and then the east part of the state is got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so
 	
 	
 		there you go
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know that's a different topic subject altogether but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know i think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime i think everyone would you and i think are probably honest and candid because we could do it on in this vehicle um but i think everybody if they were touched by it would say
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out which i think every human does i think they'd say yeah do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me you know um
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah if your friends or family get uh had that happen to them i think everyone would uh i they'd probably
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face as they did it
 	
 	
 		yeah i just don't think that uh you can rehabilitate i mean i just don't uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class and i just the subject i remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something uh just it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and
 		when you see how many repeat offenders there are uh check check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and um rape rapist getting their hand just slapped
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session you know all these uh intangible intangible intangible things and you're thinking
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal either
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because you wouldn't know what you're getting um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i don't know methods of capital punishment i have no opinions on that either i just
 	
 	
 		well uh i uh yeah i don't know i think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless because i guess it's a pretty pretty rough thing to be uh electrocuted
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		is it uh how about the injection is that suppose to be
 	
 	
 		oh yeah an injection yeah that would be even yeah i didn't even think about that
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm not even sure in the split among the fifty states do you know which way it is the ratio it's more than aren't uh that it's more that don't have it isn't that correct
 	
 	
 		i think yeah there's more that don't have it but amazingly it's like uh Massachusetts went back and reinstated capital punishment oh maybe six or seven years ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but uh it's on the books which
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah and always say do something about i'm not sure if Texas Minnesota i
 		they didn't they didn't they were against well did they have it they were against it um Texas as i said has it but i haven't been back here long enough to to realize whether or not if they've done it in the last
 	
 	
 		right
