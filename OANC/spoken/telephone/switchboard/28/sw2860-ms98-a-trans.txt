 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		there we are
 	
 	
 		yes
 		tell me what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up
 	
 	
 		oh well uh when they were little we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks and things of that sort and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		boy i had two boys they were both interested in things like model rockets so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets
 	
 	
 		i have two boys also
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um my children are um are swimmers and so as they were growing up much of uh our um normal life outside of school and everything around and
 		revolved around their swimming so in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older i became involved in it too so we were always together at their meets
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh well that's good um mine were not terribly sporting uh they both did T-ball and soccer in grade school but neither one of them carried on uh the sports after that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		yeah the the boys tried those but they really they did go in they started swimming when they were oh seven and eight and they really loved it and they're swimming both
 		they'll be one is in college also swims in college and the other will continue to swim in college and they're fortunate they may even made nationals
 	
 	
 		oh wonderful oh that's great
 	
 	
 		and so we would drive up to see that when we whenever it was reasonably close but we did a lot of things um and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children um
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		we live near Washington so we we would always go in for the museums
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sure
 	
 	
 		that's always a big uh thing and one of my children is uh also a musician so um one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go  either my husband or i or both of us would to concerts with him
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and my other child um uh is in big into tropical fish so our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit fish stores or go to fish shows so
 	
 	
 		ah
 		my goodness uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well we didn't have any uh avid uh activities like that they they were interested in a lot of things but nothing to quite that depth i guess but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't think we've we've missed a fish store on the entire east northeast coast of the United States
 	
 	
 		we would
 		oh my goodness well we did go to things like aquariums and uh uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		natural history museums and zoos and all of those things that one does with kids uh
 	
 	
 		yes in fact it's funny our vacations have always been um uh uh
 		uh as as they've gotten older when they were younger we would go to the beach but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things and that there would be a a feature each day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		ah yes
 	
 	
 		whether it would be going to one summer we uh we went up to New England and we went to the marble quarries up there and uh uh to see that and another day we fish hatchery and so we did
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know we did try and of course we learned too
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um and uh i don't know i uh when they were very young i did not work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i started working half time when uh they were at the nursery school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and i i started working part-time when they were in um junior high school and high school and now and i worked in the school system and now i work a full school day but that leaves me off on holidays and summers
 	
 	
 		but i was still home yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it was a it was a you know i think they need me more when they were older than they do when they're
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think it uh they need you in different ways
 	
 	
 		that's true yes
 	
 	
 		you want to be around for the crisis and things like that and
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		but it's not quite so much the hand holding and peanut butter and jelly making
 	
 	
 		um yeah that's that's for sure that's for sure what do you do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see
 	
 	
 		well it look well the one trend i would say is that
 		with so many more women choosing professional careers there are fewer of them home in the afternoons and i don't think it needs to be the mothers but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah when they  you know it was funny i can remember and my mother and i have talked about it how important it was when i came home from school
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it wasn't really conversation but there were always things that just tumbled out
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh a
 		granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it but it when they when it's not there they miss it
 	
 	
 		i think that's true but i don't i also think that's at least in my experience truer of girls than boys even when i was there my boys didn't share all that much with me and certainly not to the extent i did with my mother
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah no i i i realize that but it's funny they don't always do it but occasionally they do and you want
 		and when they do there's a reason for it that they're sharing it and you want to be available at least i've wanted to be available when they for some reason they had they were bouncing something off of me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about and it was uh you just felt gee if i weren't here
 	
 	
 		um-hum who would they ask or what would they do
 	
 	
 		how or or if my husband
 		that's right
 		yes that's exactly right uh but it has been um it's been interesting and particularly i i think because the society in which we live families are separated you don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i mean i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives
 	
 	
 		yeah well i did too we were close to my uh maternal grandparents i mean just a few miles and uh close enough to visit my paternal grandparents know quite often they were fifty miles away but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 		see and we're uh that we i i grew up with you know every weekend there was some visiting somewhere um and it was sort of an Italian family um but my children we although we have some relatives in the area that we
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		we see we they don't have it's not that constant
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins
 	
 	
 		well when my kids were quite small uh we lived close to both sets of grandparents and they saw them a lot but they don't have any cousins uh or they didn't their uh their cousins are about ten years younger
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh they never played together or anything and there are only two of them and they didn't live in the same town
 	
 	
 		yeah and i i just sort of think
 		yeah that the trend of of families and time where where parents are spending less time you don't have the families too to take up the gap
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and so the kids in some ways are are are suffering a little bit in that uh the model the role models that get the the the family issues that get discussed and all these i think are very important parts of them growing up so we
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we try to to do it as well as we can we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone and cousins and aunts and uncles and we do but it's although it's not the same we are
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's part of i think teachin g too is what a family is like because then how how do they pattern their own
 	
 	
 		well everyone makes it's own model but uh it it seems that there should be some continuity and it's helpful to have uh things that
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		become family traditions and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		that's yeah well we've always we have had this tradition um that we always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had now this year it's been was hard with our son now being in college so this was one thing that we um weren't able to do this year but we did that for ever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until uh our older son went away to college
 	
 	
 		oh well that's the kind of thing that they will remember though
 	
 	
 		and we have advent calendars still from the time that they came you know to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		ours finally disintegrated we had a felt one that was like it was a Christmas tree that had uh a little trinket for each day
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		that was pinned on the date and then you took it off and put it on the tree so at the end you had a decorated tree
 	
 	
 		that's uh-huh
 		well
 		ours ours is uh a friend
 	
 	
 		and it finally got moth eaten we threw it way last year
 	
 	
 		uh a friend of mine from Denmark hand appliqued one for each child
 	
 	
 		how nice
 	
 	
 		and i mean they look today as new as they did when they gave them to she gave them to us and there's a ring and you buy a present
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and you wrap the present up and i mean the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of Band-Aid and an eraser and things
 	
 	
 		how cute
 	
 	
 		to today where um sometimes i put a little gift if i see something that's uh occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save for their
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		their future to sometimes just money um pieces of candy so i think as they're getting in college i i just my for my older boy that was in college i put a dollar bill for each day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh i'm sure he appreciated that
 	
 	
 		which was the equivalent um well it was the equivalent of a Christmas present
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it was uh and it was and you know it was fun but that's a tradition and they will those will be passed on to them when they
 		when they get married and leave
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well you were saying what other trends are there and one just occurred to me because i was editing a book about it recently
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that is the trend in a lot of uh lower class areas for the grandmothers to be raising the children
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		and that's a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs
 	
 	
 		the broken yes and the broken families we um as i said living in an area of Washington DC
 	
 	
 		and
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we definitely see this uh and um it's that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising um children from the streets too frequently
 	
 	
 		right well we had a sociologist at the center where i work who was writing a book on uh multigeneration
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		matriarchies in a way uh where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she's still living at home with the mother
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes well this is a this is a sign uh this is in fact uh we've been studying this in our school that um this is one of the symptoms or not the symptoms it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing it's a rite of passage
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it they uh the the fact that they're unmarried has nothing to do with
