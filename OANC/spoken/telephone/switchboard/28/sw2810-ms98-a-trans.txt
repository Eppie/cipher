 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um
 		the one of the things that i've heard uh many people complain about the school systems was that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they didn't feel like uh people were dedicated to teaching their children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or their heart really wasn't in it you know so what they went and got a degree and and everything but it wasn't
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		their not doing it just because they want to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		are you saying the teachers or the parents
 	
 	
 		the teachers the teachers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know
 		well how do you feel about that
 	
 	
 		well i guess i
 		have mixed emotions on one hand
 		i think golly the pay isn't good enough if you didn't really want to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah you shouldn't be doing
 	
 	
 		it's probably something else out there
 		but on the other hand i think that maybe some people have thought that was kind of an easy way out
 		you can major in something basically useless to the world as a whole like say Spanish or geography geography being one of my favorite subjects but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		nevertheless it's not exactly the thing that's going to make you bucks
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but you could then go ahead and get a
 		teaching certificate and perhaps
 		feed your family a little
 	
 	
 		yeah what do you think about the the recent bill that was just passed you know where
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		they're taking the money from especially the the Dallas area
 	
 	
 		you're calling from Texas then
 	
 	
 		school
 		oh oh yeah i'm in Dallas Texas
 	
 	
 		i'm in Plano
 	
 	
 		okay yeah they're taking uh
 		the money from our schools here and distribute it some of the other outlying and and especially like west Texas what
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		what do you think about that because it's it's you know the money's coming from us here that live here and work here and
 	
 	
 		well
 		i have always believed in sharing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know if my neighbor next door was hungry and they needed something to eat or something to wear i'd be glad to share and so i guess in the global sense you have to have that kind of feeling to a certain extent but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i also don't believe that people who get funds or equipment  or anything without some of their own personal input
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		take care of it nicely or appreciate it or use it properly
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		those things have to be taught
 	
 	
 		
 
 		excuse me yeah i agree you know
 	
 	
 		so
 		you know so there's that end of it too and and i think it's going to really
 		
 
 		you know so i don't
 		i don't say that in a selfish way because i think there that it's probably not totally equitable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and i don't know that there is a good situation entirely but golly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it sure going to make a big difference in our school system
 	
 	
 		yeah it is
 	
 	
 		you know it uh i was um-hum i was talking to a friend in Irving who sits on a parents advisory council with the Irving Independent School District and she was saying they are number one
 	
 	
 		Plano yeah
 	
 	
 		they are adding next year they are adding thirty minutes to their school day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in order to accommodate the extra teaching that's going to be needed
 		because they're eliminating all aids
 		they're going to they all aids all paid aids everything is going to have to be volunteer through the parent teacher organizations
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and frankly we're all ready maxed out with parent you know uh volunteer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		work i work part-time out of my home and they did you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm always getting called and you know and used utilized you know what i'm willing to do it but i know during the days when i was uh just not a working mom at all it was ridiculous
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		they call you all the time
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah until i just finally had to say
 		i am so sorry that you know just cannot do everything for you
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		you know so there's and and the moms that work a lot of times just can't help at all and yeah
 	
 	
 		right well i i i believe that the school puts a big demand on the students on the teachers and the students for for the fact that they expect the parents to go out and
 		a lot of times chauffeur or lot of times you know buy a lot of things that might seem unnecessary but i it's unreal on the cost of sending a kid to school because of you know you spend your time voluntary and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		plus you buy a lot of extra arts crafts aids things like that notebooks for reports
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so many
 		yes
 		well and just you know the yearbook and the T-shirt and the teachers presents and the you know it really starts
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know we have five children so i know that it really
 	
 	
 		projects
 		oh my goodness so you really do yeah like uh all types of projects little bug things you know that
 	
 	
 		you know
 		um-hum i just helped a little girl yesterday a teenager friend of ours she had to prepare something for to study Greece
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they were i think she needed a recipe and the history of of the recipe or the type of food and also um
 		had to actually make it and bring it enough to serve you know fifteen people and i found the cheapest thing i could find that i could help her with and even so figuring it up i think she spent close to twenty dollars
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um and it was say you know we did a couple of different ones and it was the least expensive and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and still be able to fix it at home and tote it up there and what not so
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but that's
 	
 	
 		that's amazing because if if every child does that what are they going to do with all that
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a lot of money
 		yeah and would they really eat it of course that's not really you know the quality of education
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		
 
 		you know i think that probably you know here in Plano we are
 		uh of course state legislature you know added uh five days next year
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh i think we're going to be seeing alternative calendar very soon i i'm still basically against it although i i do understand the positives
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that are you know touted but i think overall
 	
 	
 		how do you feel about the Plano school system you feel like it's pretty good compared to the others surround you know Richardson and Allen and
 	
 	
 		there is a quality of excellence expected here it's very difficult
 		for the children in this school district to
 		excel in more than one area
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because if you get into drama if you get into speech if you get into drill team or athletics or whatever it is i mean they want you night and day they want your time they want your blood
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		yeah money and
 	
 	
 		you know so
 		and uh you know i have children who
 		been fortunate enough to be in in these extra curricular things but golly
 		you know it's just really you know it's like a smaller school system you know you could be in the drill team and you could be cheerleader too and you could be you know on the football team and still be on the basketball team and still try out for band you know
 	
 	
 		real demanding
 		
 
 		basketball
 		right
 		yeah that's amazing
 	
 	
 		so
 		you know that and you you can't do that in this school system so you know we've been working on college stuff for my oldest daughter and shoot you know
 	
 	
 		that's a
 		that's a big difference
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that uh you know you kind of
 		you know you have to to look when we were writing things down i said you know you can't really talk about all your individual things but you know you've got to make sure that when you put down band here that it's not just any old band that this is a band that took
 		this honor and that honor and participated in this competition and participated in that competition so they understand really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right
 		that's wild
 		well it's been good talking to you
 	
 	
 		well yeah this is uh this is interesting interesting topic
 	
 	
 		
 
 		thank you uh good night bye-bye
 	
 	
 		thank you Jackie have a good day bye-bye
