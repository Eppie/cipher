 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		nope
 	
 	
 		did i interrupt your reading schedule
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		been playing on my computer
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		well have you what have you read good lately
 	
 	
 		um lately
 	
 	
 		well well not not even lately tell me
 	
 	
 		well uh let's see last book i read was a science fiction book called Weapon
 	
 	
 		who's it by do you remember
 	
 	
 		um uh it was it was his first book i think not very popular
 	
 	
 		yeah my husband is a big science fiction uh reader but i don't uh care for it as much i don't have uh
 		he's a computer man too so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that sometimes goes hand in hand
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah what books are you into
 	
 	
 		well uh i'm at a stand still right now but uh um we haven't lived in Charlotte very long
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so uh and our furniture is stored somewhere else so i've had a lot of time i've read a lot of books
 		but and this is uh one group of books i'm wondering if you've read that i i guess i started reading them two or three years ago by Jean Auel uh the first one was Clan of the Cave Bear
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no i sure haven't read that
 	
 	
 		oh gosh that is wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then the second uh book of hers was Valley of the Horses
 		and the third one was the Mammoth Hunters are they sounding familiar
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and her last one which i think waited everybody waited about a year or two for to come out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh uh Plains of Passage
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh i think
 		Clan and and you have to read them in order you have to read the Clan first
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but that has that is the most different book that my i've read in many many years probably since Brave New World uh made such an impact on me many years ago
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		that's a good book
 	
 	
 		and my husband says so too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the Clan so it's if you can pick those books up uh and sometimes they're packaged together those first three in paper back
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well the last good book i read would be uh let me think
 		uh the last series i read was
 		Power that Preserves and have you ever read those by Donaldson
 	
 	
 		yes i have
 	
 	
 		yeah with the leper
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but how do you uh read more realistic books perhaps
 	
 	
 		um what do you mean
 	
 	
 		self-improvement or yeah how-to books
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		lot of computer books i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm into um neural networks and
 		artificial intelligence
 	
 	
 		you're into what
 		i'm i'm terribly i i'm sorry i didn't
 	
 	
 		neural networks and artificial intelligence
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's kind of what i've been studying in school and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		are you uh working or you a student
 	
 	
 		right now i'm just looking for a job  yeah
 	
 	
 		are you
 		well my husband is working uh temporary well under contract we had moved here after twenty years in Oklahoma
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he in fact he started with uh i guess uh well first generation computers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and is that called mainframe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so he's under contract now with uh an insurance company that has bought many agencies so uh
 		and they really needed he's an accountant also
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so they needed someone to uh
 		uh get things under control so he's been reading a lot about different kinds you know several agencies are on um
 		uh one system uh some others are on other systems right now what's not red house but what's what's that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		red house
 	
 	
 		oh i can't not red house uh the system i guess is what i'm trying to talk to um
 		he's converting to it and then they will convert from it to another one later on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but he he's you know he he's good at and he's probably uh
 		as good at troubleshooting as anybody that you can find
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but anyway uh let me talk are you uh are you married
 	
 	
 		oh no

 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's called Women of Substance
 	
 	
 		hm
