 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right uh how long have they been recycling there in Virginia
 	
 	
 		um actually quite a a a while um i've lived here for six years
 		and  can you hold on just a second
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		hello
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sorry i must have got the other line cut off um
 		so they've been doing that it for a while now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um it i live in an apartment
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and my apartment  facilities there it is hold on
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		have some problem with the phone huh
 		hello
 	
 	
 		okay sorry about that
 	
 	
 		yeah okay you're okay
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um anyhow they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only um i've been recycling for maybe about two years now and
 		at another another another public facility where they have you know recycling of glass um aluminum and paper
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh have you have you cycled plastic recycled plastic also
 	
 	
 		now
 		no and that's what i i don't understand exactly why they don't have that option
 	
 	
 		we we have out here uh up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way they had some bends around that we could find and put them in but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		not all that many it wasn't very well advertised but recently uh the refuse department has has uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it it should be good uh i think it's a marvelous idea when you think of uh when i just think of the papers that i dump out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean there just it's such a i waste i just hate to think about it
 	
 	
 		yeah now an additional thing is um where i work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they also have recycling there of um all white paper and of you know cans also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh
 	
 	
 		so because i mean a lot of people you know right at the vending machines they have receptacles
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that you know you can just pop your  cans in and near the  Xerox machines they have places you know for your paper you know i keep a uh little  box at my desk
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and i just throw as i'm using the white paper you know i just throw it right in there and then you know they have someone that comes around and pick it up you know every afternoon
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah all that's neat
 	
 	
 		which you know is an excellent idea at work because i know the amount paper they go through there because
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's right i guess one of the things i think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		about it there's needs to be more public uh service of programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening
 	
 	
 		yeah i would agree with that
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		and there's i've seen a few things but not very much really and i i think that's a shame they need to uh do a little more i'd like to know for instance when i when they say uh plastic
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		all plastic what kind of plastic can you put all together or is there some reason not to uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use i don't know
 	
 	
 		exactly uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i i'd be glad to
 		organize it  if that they'd tell me what it is i'm doing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		because that would that would be really helpful
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah yeah i agree with you there another thing that i like here which is i do with i have to actually go to two different recycling areas because
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		one of them is that um their aluminum cans is for um Children's Hospital for a burn fund
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so all the monies are donated you know for the recycling to Children's Hospital which i think is an excellent idea there you know because the other public
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum that's great
 		now that gives you a little bit of incentive there uh-hum
 	
 	
 		right right and before even at work before they started the recycling plan which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year i had had everyone in my department recycling and you know i would have them drop
 	
 	
 		swing them for you huh
 	
 	
 		right drop their cans off in my office and then i would haul them you know here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which got people really going into it but
 	
 	
 		i think that's right i think i think helping us be more enthusiastic enthusiastic about it helping us maybe maybe using the money for something special that would be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		like paying off the national debt
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that there there you go
 	
 	
 		making sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's for sure
 	
 	
 		but i i think that's right i think they there needs to be a little bit more in the area of of uh
 		advertisement advertisement and  letting public letting you understand more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how you're it's done and what what happens to it because i think that's that would help a lot
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right right
 		um-hum and i'm sure you know in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more you know i've seen a definite trend you know towards more recycling everywhere you know even at McDonald's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know with their their use of no foam containers anymore
 	
 	
 		yes i i i'm glad to see some of these things i think
 	
 	
 		right i think i think it is getting more you know advertisement
 	
 	
 		people are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do and that we need to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped and all these things that i think that's true
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		well i think i'm that's about my uh  some on recycling but i i enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		okay well i did too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh all right bye now
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
