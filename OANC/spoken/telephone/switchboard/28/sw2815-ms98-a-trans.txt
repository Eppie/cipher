 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		um where are you from Connie
 	
 	
 		i'm from Dennison
 	
 	
 		from Dennison well we live in Plano
 	
 	
 		Plano great what are they doing anything down there for recycling
 	
 	
 		yes as a matter of fact they really are in uh February i think it was the city started the first phase
 		of a three part first two phases of a three part phase in for uh uh city wide you know collection type thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and the way they're doing this is they said no more trash bags is that how you set out your trash
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah that's the way we always had too no more trash bags and they assigned everybody
 		well i think it's ninety five gallons big bucket
 	
 	
 		well that's neat
 	
 	
 		and uh and you can put everything you know they all look the same they're great big green things they run on rollers they're not hard at all even my
 		you know eight and ten year old can do it take them out to the street we used to have twice a week collection and now they have once a week collection for that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you don't have to use the garbage bags anymore you just uh
 	
 	
 		do you separate your trash
 	
 	
 		not yet but
 	
 	
 		well i think they should do that
 	
 	
 		that's the third part the second part is we now have a
 		uh paper type biodegradable real big bag for all the lawn clippings and anything and they've always been encouraging us to not bag our
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i thought about that last last this last couple weeks ago when we bagged up our leaves it was sixteen or eighteen bags of leaves
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh gosh
 	
 	
 		and yeah and it takes forever for that plastic to dissolve
 	
 	
 		well we have a garden and so we have always you know we'll rake the leaves and then we mow them so they're little chibbles you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and you use it as mulch
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and use them as mulch in the garden or around the yard so you know we've done that for along time and we try not to bag our grass clippings unless its just so long we have to but then we put it back on the garden so i've never worried about that but
 		um they are doing that now where you cannot put out grass stuff you see when you put out your regular trash
 	
 	
 		ah
 		they won't let you good
 	
 	
 		huh-uh now the third part is and it was supposed to have started in May but something and i don't remember the exact reason from Persian Gulf um
 		trickle down fouled that up and so now we're not going to do that until end of June but then they will give us another container that where we will put everything recyclable glass plastic
 	
 	
 		right
 		paper
 	
 	
 		uh paper can go now we bundle that on top of our  and set it out beside our green
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		thing full a newspaper but but the other kinds of paper will go
 		and like i say did i say glass glass plastic other papers tin aluminum
 		and there's something else
 	
 	
 		oh i can't think of anything milk cartons and soda bottles
 	
 	
 		yeah like that too that all comes under plastic and glass i can't think what the other thing is anyway we won't even have to sort it at least that's what they say but the guy will come by and sort it there at the curb
 	
 	
 		well that's good that's neat
 		oh that's going to be a lot of hard work though
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		for them
 	
 	
 		yes but it will be more profitable in the long run from what i understand because
 	
 	
 		well i know everybody's throwing away millions of dollars worth of plastic and stuff everyday just to be buried
 	
 	
 		they have already they sell all this stuff and see we have recycling centers here in the town that are setup by the city
 		and that are you know emptied but you know like it will say on there uh green glass only or aluminum only
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then somebody comes along and mixes it up doesn't do it right
 		its better for them to hire somebody and pay somebody to do it right because if you even put in just say you had this huge
 		container of white glass and three or four brown or green glass bottles got in there and got shattered there's no way you can pick all that out
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you see what i'm saying so it you know its useless
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		that well it's not useless it just can't be sold as clear glass anymore back to the recycle places they say well uh you know look you already you've got and they have percentages you know
 	
 	
 		they're not doing much down here though
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that what they will accept
 	
 	
 		the only they think i've heard of them doing down here in Dennison is Wal-Mart let's you put there you know uh milk cartons and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		two liter bottles those clear plastic bottles that's about it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well all of our um grocery stores are going to um
 		they have each of one i shop at i go to a Skaggs and Albertson's and a Kroger and they will let you bring in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		your own little paper bags or plastic bags they'll let you recycle them or you can bring them in and actually use them again
 	
 	
 		little carry-on bags
 		
 
 		okay well they're doing that but every time i get paper bags at a grocery store i bring home bugs
 	
 	
 		do you um i
 	
 	
 		yeah and i can't do it
 	
 	
 		don't know that i've ever had that problem i just try to reuse mine a lot at home too and
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but used to you know if i had a torn sack when i got home i just trashed it you know and anymore i don't do that i'll put it in with the paper recycling you know the newspaper or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well they ought to do that around down here
 	
 	
 		um that always seems to help the uh um a lot of times if i know i'm just even if i know i've got a big family so you know i rarely come home with you know just a sack or two
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i have two canvas sacks that are big that are especially for taking to the grocery store that kind of thing and i'll always take those and use them and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right i've seen those
 		real environmentally conscious aren't you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i always have been i always have been and uh i kind of got out of the habit of it you know for a few years when my children were
 	
 	
 		
 
 		small
 	
 	
 		well when they
 	
 	
 		did you use diapers
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		disposable diapers
 	
 	
 		i didn't with my first three but i did with my last two
 	
 	
 		
 
 		goodness you've got five kids
 	
 	
 		and yeah i have five and uh
 		well the actually now i think about it i think it was number three that i used them a lot with and then number four came along and i used them some with him
 		most of the time i think i used them with number four
 	
 	
 		well i've got a three month old i used disposables on her for about a month and a half just to keep her from breaking out so bad
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and then she had reaction to the
 	
 	
 		oh she had reactions to cloth diapers it was from staying wet more often
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah oh they've just improved the
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah well she's doing better they have are they biodegradable or more biodegradable i heard they're the worst things
 	
 	
 		disposables so much
 		oh yeah they really fill up
 	
 	
 		because they stay forever
 	
 	
 		but they work so good  i mean that's one thing that we moms just think oh gosh
 	
 	
 		yeah they do
 		i don't mind using cloth diapers i really don't it's not all that much more work
 	
 	
 		i uh
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		it's not all that much more work for disposable i mean for cloth
 	
 	
 		well i always had you know several in diapers at the same time so that may have been you know why they looked so nice to me but
 	
 	
 		yeah well cloth i mean disposables do look better they look they're not quite as bulky
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she looks like a little mushroom
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i used disposables with my first little boy
 	
 	
 		well you know that well i think its just
 		you know that you i think have to have in your mind an attitude of trading off you just say to yourself well this is not worth it to me to do such and so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i want to make up for it because i want to be real conscientious in this and that you know what i'm saying you
 	
 	
 		right well i'm
 	
 	
 		you know all of us can to something and you know what works for one family may not work for another family
 		and
 	
 	
 		well i know to with disposable diapers though if you use cloth diapers your polluting with more soap and using more water and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true and you're using more electricity you're using it uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		more where as when you buy the others they used it more at the factory  so you know you wonder you know you're not using it but somebody used it to create that item you know
 	
 	
 		yeah you're right yeah
 		you're right  i didn't even think about that
 	
 	
 		so
 		but you know you know then you you figured on down the line it did give people jobs
 		i use cloth diapers for a lot of stuff just besides you know if my kids have got a cold you know i put them in bed with cloth diapers  you know
 	
 	
 		with a cloth diaper
 	
 	
 		to use instead of a hanky or or tissue you you know they can could just flat go through three dollars worth of tissue you in a morning you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah she's just
 		right and uh-huh
 		and they are the best dusters
 	
 	
 		i know it  and they make wonderful dusters
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		no question about it well i just you know i'm really glad to see us a world coming back to this and
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really coming to a head it's been building up for a few years i remember this going on when i was a teenager
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 	
 	
 		for about the last ten years
 	
 	
 		how long have you been married
 	
 	
 		five years
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i've got two children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so you know when you say you're a teenager you know i uh
 		i've been married seventeen years and have always been you know like i say always been conscious this way but
 	
 	
 		um
 		i haven't not until this year it's really starting to
 	
 	
 		so it's all brand new to you then to think of these things
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		well they've really started you know i wish they would do that um with uh the buckets here instead of the trash bags here the city sends us trash bags
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh yeah that's what we had the program before too
 		well there's a lot of information if you ever get to Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you come in very often
 	
 	
 		no i don't
 	
 	
 		well if you ever get to come here you must put on your list of place to go  is a place called
