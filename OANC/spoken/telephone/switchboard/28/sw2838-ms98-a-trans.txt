 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh the the interesting scale that they assigned it uh  the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free
 		i'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle i guess i i don't mind regulating all of the the guns and i
 		would certainly call for a ban on certain types now the the wisdom as to which types that's gonna be a debate forever i would assume
 		uh the method of of controlling it well that's all into how much money you wanna put into the the controls um one point that was made in the
 		house hearings or the the representative who stood up and said that uh you know we can check a guy's credit card instantly
 		but uh we don't wanna check his background and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes uh but there's still the the technology exists to to check it if they want
 	
 	
 		hm right
 	
 	
 		so it's it's it's kind of a
 		uh i guess you got to put a dollar figure on it if you really wanna make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that and then you've got the group the people that decide that there's
 		there's no particular reason to have them at all and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it
 		and i guess i would fall more in the the realm that i like the sport issue of it but i i could give it up
 		without too much trouble it's not the world's most pleasurable thing and it costs a bit to do it uh finding ranges and things like that um i have shot a variety of guns for a number of years but it's just it's not
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right
 	
 	
 		like golf or whatever i mean there are other things that you could go do  so uh i i don't see the the
 		joy of shooting is is that much of a driving factor i think uh society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety
 		so the number of kids that tend to get hurt i don't even keep the gun in our house so uh we don't have that problem but uh  it's it's a hard hard topic i guess for a lot of people have a lot of hard issue a lot of hard feelings about it
 	
 	
 		yes
 		right
 		they do and you boy you can get them  on either side  and just like you say uh well i think i i guess i'd have to  place myself uh
 		uh probably seven or eight  because or not wait wait onto no control i'm sorry uh excuse me that uh uh two or three
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i was going the wrong direction  um because of we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because they had a gun in the house and the the father kept the bullets in a separate place but the little boy was five years old and was so
 		intelligent enough to  uh he knew where booth both places were loaded the gun and they were playing cowboys and Indians and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes
 	
 	
 		boy
 	
 	
 		so uh i mean it it destroyed two families uh in just that instant and and i a lot of people say that they need it for protection uh having
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		worked at one time in Baltimore or i don't know if you're in a big city are you Dallas yeah that's a big city  um then you know that uh uh
 	
 	
 		Dallas um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		if you live anywhere real close that uh the safety is uh some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break-ins and you know but uh uh we have never
 		had a gun in the house with my children growing up uh i um uh once uh uh knew a fellow that had had been a policeman and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber
 		he's going to assume that you know how to use it well and he's going to you know try to shoot first uh so you know if he's got one um and if not um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		then usually they uh if he's got a knife or whatever they could throw it at you  i mean you know they he he said that it it's better not to have especially myself now i'm a widow and uh i so i'm
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh when my handicapped son is is not at home i'm by myself but uh there's i still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's it's really  um playing Russian Roulette if you do  uh
 	
 	
 		yeah about the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the the
 		person was coming your way if once you're surprised it's too late and and the rare circumstances you know the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming and had time to do anything about it
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 		right
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and i don't have that problem is i don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one and the uh NRA's um
 		claim that the uh the constitutional and the right to bear arms and that whole statement uh it's hard to know the original intent but i i don't see it as that
 		that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that uh yeah its the right to to arm a militia and as opposed to just the general public and you have a
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you have a earn a right not just a privilege as it were if you were gonna serve in the militia then you have a right to have that arm but uh or you know there's all sorts of arguments there but i don't even worry about
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		i know
 	
 	
 		the what the original intent was they didn't have this problem back then  so we we change our rights with our social status they're man given rights and they can be taken away by a man so
 	
 	
 		no
 		no that's true that that's that's right that's right
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh the people that hide behind that i don't worry about they can go live in another country if they want
 	
 	
 		well the yeah that's how i feel too i know well even even here where i work uh we have uh a gun club and of course those people are very avid
 		they you know they say there should be no ban that it's not but i can't see why any uh on on the street citizen should be able allowed to be allowed to have a machine gun
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns it would be hard to decide but there are a few guns that uh just are not uh sport or
 		i mean i don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either  so um uh i i think they should have at least some control over over those things um when and when you were speaking about  they can check up
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know on credit cards well i i understand about the privacy act and everything  but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not that to me would not be an unreasonable thing and if they do course
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		the argument with the people in the gun club um is that uh well the people that are going to get guns are the ones who are going to steal them anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and so it's not gonna be that they're buying them course some of them do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it it it is a hard question
 	
 	
 		tends to tends to strap only the legitimate people most regulation does most it's very difficult to uh legislate uh
 	
 	
 		right oh yeah
 	
 	
 		crooks or whatever you wanna however you wanna word it so it's well this may be a never ending topic i got a couple of calls  waiting on me so i better let you go
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		okay well thanks for talking  bye-bye now
 	
 	
 		okay bye
