 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		perhaps uh
 		maybe we were a little unsure because we were looking at something broader
 		you know nationwide worldwide or something maybe we should look city wide
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		you know or school board wide or you know what i'm saying narrow the topic a little and see if if we don't uh recognize some trends there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		um one thing that i definitely have noticed in our area as far as the school system at least uh
 		token wise  i'm not sure that uh really truly uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh we're effectively counting but at at least for a show we're involving more parents in input and
 	
 	
 		more parent input
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum um like i say this all may be in name only
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		kind of thing at this point but at least it's a step in the right direction i think
 	
 	
 		well do you have school age children
 	
 	
 		i have five school age children
 	
 	
 		oh so you're you're definitely more
 		involved at least in the schools school system my children are grown so
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well we uh
 		we try to keep abreast of it
 		uh of some of the things that are that are going on and
 		we've uh
 		we've just gone through some city elections here in in Plano for our city council
 	
 	
 		for city council do you all have a mayor or
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		you do yeah we we do in Houston too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh Whitmire is is she still the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah she's still she's still there but it looks like uh she may have some
 		the opposition or they're they're trying to beat them she's been in for so long so we may hear some interesting things about her before election time comes up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		this time but she's uh uh
 		okay i don't know is  would a trend does it seem to be we're having more minority type people women in government
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		as far as in the local like our  our our our our chief of police is a woman our our mayor is a woman our superintendent superintendent of of schools was a woman she's just now you know
 		been pushed out
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't know if you would consider that a trend or not
 	
 	
 		oh i definitely think it's a trend uh you know this morning on the way to school we just uh
 		it just so happened that we saw a lot of buses and
 		i usually don't have all my children in the bus in the car at once but i'd taken them all to the chiropractor this morning one big fell swoop and then we were going on to school but just a tad late long enough for the buses to be going back and
 	
 	
 		you
 		uh
 	
 	
 		the kids said gosh look how many of these bus drivers are women and i said you know that really is a good indication of some of the jobs that have been
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know that trend that has swung you know one profession that you know there are a lot of women now and i think it's good because
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		those women sometimes pick up on those kids emotional needs and
 		might you know be aware of those things coming or going from school where maybe the men don't always you know they're just there to drive the bus you know and the women are more
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i saw uh the the superintendent that we've had was being considered for the superintendent in the Boston area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they just she just lost out to someone from the Dallas area like assistants somebody who's an one of the assistants in your i'm not sure what the name maybe it was another woman
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		must have been from uh DIS
 	
 	
 		maybe so yeah maybe so
 	
 	
 		but i definitely think think that administratively in the schools women are
 		are a show of force now that we did not see even
 		five years ago
 		certainly not you know ten years ago up to that point they were allowed to be teachers secretaries nurses
 		so forth even your uh heads of uh
 		you know like your food services that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		your your deans you know they weren't women
 		um you know that's
 	
 	
 		lots of school principals seem to be women in the at least in the Houston area
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i've noticed over over the years that my kids were in school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh more and more
 	
 	
 		fact i don't even remember any
 		uh school that they went to that there there wasn't a women principal from elementary school on up
 	
 	
 		on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh that's excellent excellent you know that they're getting a chance
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah but but then again you know it would be nice to have more you know the majority of teachers
 		seem to be women it would be nice to have but the problem is the pay scale probably it's because
 		you know women go into teaching probably not so much for the money but uh
 		for the satisfaction and that's just what they want to want to do whereas uh i think if you're a college professor
 	
 	
 		the type of uh
 	
 	
 		probably the pay is much better and you tend to see more i think you see more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well i don't know it seems like there there are a lot of a lot more men at least in the the college level so
 	
 	
 		well and that comes once again you know is that you can teach in elementary school you can even substitute in elementary school in the state of Texas without a
 		uh without a certificate
 	
 	
 		you can teach
 	
 	
 		yes you can substitute teach without a certificate or a degree
 	
 	
 		substitute
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then you know work on that and if you want to work on up but you still can make good money you know
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		part-time part-time money as a substitute whereas you know to teach on college level you have to have a PhD almost always sometimes you can get by on a fellowship program or something where you might be teaching but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you do you have any idea how much uh uh a substitute teacher would make per day i'm sure they pay them by the day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh here in Plano they pay about fifty dollars a day
 	
 	
 		well i mean that's good part-time money
 	
 	
 		that's good part-time money for but it's not career money
 	
 	
 		yeah but it's not
 		no
 	
 	
 		you know but it uh
 	
 	
 		course it you know
 	
 	
 		you know for a part-time situation
 	
 	
 		just somebody
 	
 	
 		and once you've gotten your foot in the door for several years substituting and then take on a degree
 		you know you're pretty well assured of a of a job in the system eventually
 		that you know that you've been subbing in a lot of times you know i think that's uh
 		i think uh one thing that uh
 		that we're seeing you know a trend in uh politics is
 		that our cities are taking a lot more responsibility for uh citizens becoming involved in the environment uh
 	
 	
 		yes it's true
 	
 	
 		recycling uh clean up programs refurbishing you know historical and and uh
 		park land
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		your uh city you know where they they adopt a highway kinds of things those are becoming more and more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		government uh originated
 		and not just private enterprise
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know generated
 	
 	
 		which i think is something that has to happen in order to
 	
 	
 		to make people do it probably
 	
 	
 		to make it happen right
 	
 	
 		which you know i thought Texas would be the last place to ever
 		um
 		get people to do those things voluntarily and i think their don't mess with Texas campaign has been very effective because Texans don't like to be told what to do they're very proud of their state
 		so they've
 		psychologically they've done a number on us there
 	
 	
 		well a couple weeks ago i was at the Houston International Festival which is you know in the downtown area and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the friend a friend of mine that was with me uh commented on on how clean
 		uh you know when you have an event like that of course everybody you know there's just food and everything else and of course they have the the you know the places to throw the stuff but you really they were really use they really use it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because in the past you know it seemed like i can remember people just just throw it down they don't care but you're you're finally getting to the point where it's just kind of second nature to find some place to to throw it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh  can you remember driving down the highway i could as a kid you know you just get rid of it you roll the window down and you throw it out but you wouldn't
 	
 	
 		well my mother was always real picky about that kind of thing i think i'd probably have my fingers cut off if i'd ever thrown out a candy wrapper or anything but
 	
 	
 		well you're probably younger than i am because i you know um but i can remember
 		uh
 		probably probably uh in the early seventies uh going out on you know taking our boat out and stuff like that and looking for places for trash bins and stuff and that was very new at that time you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum that that
 	
 	
 		so it's uh yeah it really hasn't been that long i mean it's probably twenty years or so that you know it really began
 	
 	
 		yes yes
 	
 	
 		so yeah
 	
 	
 		i agree for it to and to be adopted and funded
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know by cities and you think the incredible amount of
 		you know money that we vote for our cities to spend on these kinds of things so
 		you know it's definitely uh you know you have to consider that a political trend because we're the ones voting for those people
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know to that are in favor of those kinds of programs and make them you know campaign issues
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		how about the representation that you have on the city council is it
 		uh you know we're we're i think we're to vote going to have increased the number so that we will be able to represent uh like the Mexican Americans don't feel like they've had enough representation and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well of course Dallas is in a great upheaval right now over the fourteen one and ten four one
 		you know programs and it's you know going back and forth between courts to you know
 	
 	
 		what is that i'm
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		have to be plead ignorant here
 	
 	
 		the um
