 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		oh go ahead Ken so Ken how do you do your family budget
 	
 	
 		well we don't actually have a budget budget per se what we do is uh
 		sort of maintain a normal checkbook you know like everybody in the world does i guess and occasionally it actually balances and then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um we also we um we have a a US Air Visa card and then every every dollar we every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		it's a real good deal actually if you charge a lot so what we what what my wife and i have taken to doing is charging everything in sight anything we buy we charge including groceries and so forth so what we'll do is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well then you just pay it off at the end of the month
 	
 	
 		right we actually maintain a we have a savings a savings we have we we we have a checking account that we treat like a savings account scratch that we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so what we do is we anytime we do or make or charge something we write it out as if we wrote a check
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then at the end of the month all the money's there covered already so we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything
 	
 	
 		oh that's a really good idea
 	
 	
 		it keeps us hopping
 	
 	
 		yeah see now i'd never get my wife to be able to follow that
 		before we got married i had money in the bank i owned my own home i put in so much money each you know month towards long term savings you know like in uh mutual funds and things you know
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh after i got married no it just didn't work anymore
 		uh she spends a lot she likes to spend on anything and everything  with body lotion  everything so we really haven't uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		we don't have a good organized system yet maybe after awhile i'll rub off on her or something  i don't think
 	
 	
 		well you know you know what's you know what's always good is sort of a force savings where they just take money out of you're pay we did that for awhile where um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we actually still do it with with my wife's salary where we put it we have a separate a a a third account even um i mean a savings account in an in an entirely different bank where what we do is take
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		money out of her paycheck every week i'm a graduate student uh oh really in what field
 	
 	
 		yes so am i yeah uh well uh in information systems i'm a voice researcher
 	
 	
 		oh okay i'm in uh i i work in psycholinguistics actually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um but my wife's has a real job yeah and what she'll yeah  so what we do is we take money out of her out of her paycheck each week
 	
 	
 		yeah so does mine
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and put it it it goes directly into another account that we don't at at a at an entirely separate bank that we don't have access to so easily and it it goes there and it stays there and it builds up until we need it for something
 	
 	
 		yeah see i think we might have to do that  because she looks at what she brings home each week i it's going to be really hard for her to uh not have her own money
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		because like now you know i put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years and now she wants to go back to school but she saved enough maybe to get her through August
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and that's it even and i keep saying now Laura you're going to have to save a little money i don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through it doesn't work Ken  my mother always said don't argue about money so we don't
 	
 	
 		oh
 		right
 		Jesus
 		right that's the thing you you you don't argue about it
 	
 	
 		uh but uh but you know uh there goes my savings  but you know i it's one of those things it's
 	
 	
 		oh God
 		oh God
 		yeah i i got lucky my wife apparently is is is not a she likes to spend but she's pretty good about things
 	
 	
 		yeah now see my wife will do things like make clothes
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		uh you know one of our one of our big investments that you know was i was wholeheartedly in favor of was to buy a sewing machine because she makes clothes and you know a descent sewing machine will really help her out and and she's already made you know presents and gifts and things
 		for shorts for me and things for the summer you know so i guess i can't you know we've probably almost paid off the sewing with uh
 	
 	
 		that's great
 		with the money savings there
 	
 	
 		yeah the savings from that so i can't complain too much you know she she's good about that and also we we dine at home a lot you know she likes to cook so that saves us from restaurants or whatever but
 	
 	
 		that's good
 	
 	
 		but she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money money dumped down a drain you know
 	
 	
 		right well i guess we all have those things though i mean i uh i uh  i i go to uh i pay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what i think is a lot of money to go to a karate class you know for the you know i pay up through the year
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah but you need a hobby
 	
 	
 		right exactly so you know that but that to her is sort of a waste but but she does her nails so
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true yeah
 		i know and those nails are so expensive
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore i guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow
 	
 	
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and then she waits for them to get their color back and then she'll polish them again i don't know whatever so she stopped for awhile boy what a difference they buy nail polish every two weeks it's  uh gosh and lotion oh my goodness body lotion
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		we spend more on on soft body on on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things
 		than
 		uh she must spend more on one application of body lotion than i do on soap for an entire year
 		and so
 	
 	
 		yeah  good old Ivory um well it it's for your benefit though right that's what
 	
 	
 		yeah it's funny
 		oh i think so she's always soft that's true
 	
 	
 		always soft  you know uh so so that's helpful
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah but i i think um i don't know maybe after uh we're not in school anymore we'll be much better at saving i think uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that's uh
 	
 	
 		now do you still own a house you said you owned one
 	
 	
 		i sold my house and that's what's really paying for my
 		uh time unemployed or whatever you know because the graduate assistantship really doesn't cover the ten thousand dollars in tuition really doesn't cover living expenses
 	
 	
 		oh that's great
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh now well we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job so that makes it hard um with you know we're paying double rent and double utilities
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and that makes it sort of expensive but see i live within my i live within my meniar menial  very menial income and she doesn't  she doesn't live within her her professional income you know so i just get a
 	
 	
 		right there that'll kill you
 		that's the killer two apartments and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah and and then even if we want to see each other on weekends it's twenty five thirty dollars in gas every weekend and that really adds up too you know so
 	
 	
 		wow
 		wow
 	
 	
 		it uh it gets tough but i
 	
 	
 		well that'll kill you yeah
 	
 	
 		i think we'll do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone you know well it'll cut our telephone bills
 	
 	
 		eventually right i mean you're not
 	
 	
 		you know yeah by five by four fifths you know if if if she's here so it's it's actually tough this year but it'll be better in June she'll be move live together in June so hopefully our budget will in increase then
 	
 	
 		right my God
 		have you been married for long or
 	
 	
 		no just since December
 	
 	
 		oh wow so you guys really are newlyweds
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we're  very newlyweds and but that's the you know we were together for probably um
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		uh very close for about six months before we got married so you know we lived within uh though i owned held had my own house and things you know we still uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we're still pretty close and i knew her spending habits and and they're about the same they haven't changed at all you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my mother always said to me Tom now the best thing to do is be like you're father never say a word when you're wife spends money and i was like well that's true my dad never said a word you know yeah so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes because i think you know um i sort i sort of feel guilty if you know given that she makes twice as much as i do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i sort say you know if she wants to go out and buy something i never argue with her because she's  she's real good at you know sort of saving and um
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't i don't argue with her but i just get all i guess i i it must show on my face
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know must be like  like must be cringes or something you know um especially like yesterday or this past weekend we met half way between at uh at her parents house and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she had on a new pair of jeans and she'd gotten all new underwear and i was like  Laura  how did you get all this stuff she goes well i just got paid and and i was like oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		had the money in their pocket yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it was there it was burning it had to be spent you know but she said everything was on sale and i'm like oh oh that's good at least it was on sale that's good honey i'm glad you bought it on sale  what else can you say
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		that's right i do recommend the force savings bit the uh they take it out of your paycheck before you see it because then it doesn't hurt
 	
 	
 		yeah i think
 		yeah you don't notice it i think that's probably a really good idea
 	
 	
 		you know you don't even think about it if it's gone you know so uh until you really need it and then all of a sudden you realize you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know we managed do it that way
 	
 	
 		yeah see i i was when i had when i was living alone and i had my own house and things uh you know i put one i was paid twice a month one paycheck went into savings and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage
 		and the food bills and it and i was even able to you know to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account because i'm pretty thrifty and you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but my wife likes to spend she enjoys so that's fine
 		but uh for savings i'll have to look into that
 	
 	
 		well
 		yeah that's just that and that uh that has been our godsend you know we had some we've had some sort of major emergencies come up you know where um we also own our own house um we had an ice storm up here recently
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		where it was it was pathetic i mean it was horrible i mean half the half the city owned trees or or or or half the one third of of of all the vegetation in this county is just wiped out
 	
 	
 		oh really because of the heavy ice
 	
 	
 		yeah it just it just weighed exactly
 	
 	
 		it broke the limbs
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and our um we had to trim our backyard that had tremendous willow tree that
 		it fortunately we didn't have to bring it down all the way but it cost us you know a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down i mean just to take off what was broken there plus we went and lived with friends you know this and that and and then the whole ice storm cost us still quite a bit of money even though insurance picked up some of it
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		still not all of it they don't get you know and that plus and then we had a car expense like that same week one of the cars died you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		all those things then they add up and that force savings really comes in handy then
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i can see that that's i keep trying to say to her you know Laura don't spend so much what happens if something happens to a car you know she's oh well it'll you well nothing'll happen ooh ooh i always just shut
 	
 	
 		right
