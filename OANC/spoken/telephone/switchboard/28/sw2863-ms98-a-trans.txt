 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay obviously the team that i support would be the Cowboys um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i say that i support them there's been just so much that's happened to that team since they got rid of Tom Landry that was just like you know blasphemy around here
 	
 	
 		well and uh we felt the same way he was an institution and how how could they do that
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		i know i know i don't think i'll ever forget when one of my friends called me and said you're not going to believe this because i had not heard it you know and they said they have fired Tom Landry it's like  you know what slander how could they do such a thing
 		so uh ever you know since that i used to be such a an avid fan you know it was ridiculous but now quite honestly i i think that i support the Oilers as much as anybody
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know just because it is a Texas team but i cannot stand Jimmy Johnson or Jerry Jones
 	
 	
 		can't stand Jimmy Johnson or Jerry well uh you know i was just trying i was just trying to think of uh who who our coaches of Houston Oilers you probably know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah yeah i really i don't even i don't know now
 	
 	
 		uh it'll probably come to me but i was thinking of
 	
 	
 		yeah i just i think of Bum Bright you know but that's been many many many years ago
 	
 	
 		the
 		yeah well Bum Bum Phillips
 	
 	
 		yeah Bum Phillips i'm sorry yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well he's the one that we couldn't believe that they they let go and then we had Jerry Glanville who is guess is now in Atlanta and now we get the guy who was the University of Houston
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		head coach for many years it'll come to me in a minute
 	
 	
 		yeah i can't i can't think
 	
 	
 		so we did pretty well uh
 	
 	
 		yeah how did you feel about having about Jerry Glanville
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know people either hate him or they they like him quite a bit
 	
 	
 		well i didn't really hate him or anything but i think the image of the team as a whole just had a real dark image and he he wanted to make these you know the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh kind of like the Oakland Raiders used to be the real bad team and they were they were mean and we had so many penalties and it gets really you just really get ticked off
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		when your team keeps getting these stupid penalties and they don't seem to you know i mean that's just terrible and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah it's it's you know it aggravates me no end when you're talking about a really close game and then they do something stupid like start a fight or you know they have they have something like that called and then that is aggravating yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh or do something where where you know it puts the other team in a better advantage and you know just for some stupid things that we probably could have done better so
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i feel like the image of the on the Oilers has really been cleaned up and like last year Warren Moon and and so many of the guys are doing some good things off the field
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so it seems like though uh it seems like all my teams always you know that i that are local to me wherever i live from when my husband was in college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know you just never on a given day they could do anything and then on another day but they the consistency just when it really gets down to the championship or or the really mean meaningful uh game
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh yeah it seems like they blow it
 	
 	
 		they don't come through
 		course now Dallas did great for many years
 	
 	
 		oh yeah you know it was just like you were so spoiled it was such a novelty if they lost a game you know and they could lose one game out of you know the whole season and people would just be completely up in arms
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i really you know as far as future of the Cowboys i really hate to say it but i think they're going to end up being a contender within the next couple of years i really feel like that will
 	
 	
 		
 
 		think so well they've been down for a while so it kind of runs in cycles i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah and
 	
 	
 		so you have the teams that stay up on top for several years and then they start
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right i think and it's a sad thing to say but i think it really depends on how much money it you know money it always comes back to money everything does
 		but if uh Jerry Jones continues to pay these guys what you know they say they're paying them i don't know you know i think it depends on you end up you know the best players will come there if they're going to be paid the most so
 		uh you know i don't know it's interesting we'll just have to see but it's just very very difficult for me to to support them it's
 		you know a lot of the guys i really like you know and and uh i loved Herschel Walker that just blew me away when they traded him
 		you talking you were talking about somebody that was really involved in the community and did a lot of things for for kids and stuff like that he was extremely involved in that in that aspect
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think that's why i i liked him so well but uh i don't know you know when i i watch it and then i start sort of seeing myself enjoying it i'm like you're just you're just doing this for the players you know don't think about Jerry Jones or Jimmy Johnson either one but
 		you know it'd just be so aggravating when they did win and then uh Jerry Jones would come out of the uh you know the press box i mean i would just go uh you know wild it's like it ruined the whole game for me because i had to look at him you know
 	
 	
 		is he the owner
 	
 	
 		yeah he's the owner uh-huh and he and uh Jimmy Johnson went to uh college together they played football together in college
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and so they're like this is just like the buddy system you know and they're of course they're not from Texas so that riled everybody up you know  this is like Arkansas people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so uh that didn't go over well so we'll see as i said i really think that they'll eventually
 		they'll eventually be a contender so
 	
 	
 		well this should be uh we did pretty well last year so i'm thinking this ought to this ought to be a good year for us well have have you been involved at all in this new World Football League i haven't watched the first thing
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's
 		no i haven't uh you know i find myself it's just it seems like it's so hard to uh i don't know why it is but it's just so hard for me to get involved in it you know i love football
 	
 	
 		well it
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know i feel like i'm not watching the NFL for some reason it's like oh it really doesn't count you know and that's terrible but that's just sort of the way i feel about it
 	
 	
 		doesn't count but
 		well i tend to tend to uh well when my son was still at home uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		course he watched everything sports and i was involved but i tend not to watch things so much now unless
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh if it's my home team
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or you know basically that's it or it's or it's some championship type games or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah i mean you you see you can definitely get involved in it more when it's somebody that you've supported all along and it's someone local because you've got all the press you know
 		you read more about them of course and and hear more about them on on television a nd and such but
 		uh i you know as much as i love it i would think that i would sit down and watch it but it just as i said for some reason it's like oh they you know they're just out there playing around they don't uh
 		they don't really they don't really count
 	
 	
 		who is the quarterback i don't even know who that your quarterback is
 	
 	
 		uh for Dallas uh my mind went blank i can picture his face
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		has he been there couple three years
 	
 	
 		yeah he's uh he's been here for several years oh pooh
 		oh well it'll come to me as soon as we hang up i can't i cannot think of his name he's been injured they've done he's had several surgeries he's a young like a young kid i mean you know he's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know if he's even twenty five yet i don't think but uh he uh he's had as i said several surgeries on his hand and and uh he's making a fortune of course he didn't play that much
 		uh last season he was out for maybe you know four or five games so
 	
 	
 		well Warren Moon broke his i think his was it his little finger or his thumb i forget toward the last couple of games of the season so he was out for the you know the last part so
 	
 	
 		you know
 		yeah uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		course he's not real young either he's
 	
 	
 		that's true he is he's considered an old timer i suppose
 	
 	
 		in his
 		he's probably in his early thirties i would think at least uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know if we don't do something with him at the helm you know then it may be downhill then for us for a while
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah yeah you know it takes a it takes a strong leader in that position
 	
 	
 		because we had the guy the i forget the guy's name the one who came in for him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and played in one game you know we made some play-offs or something toward the end it seems like and this guy came in and we won i mean the guy played beautifully and then then the next week which was a really important game
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it didn't he it just fell apart didn't work but it but you talk about exciting when something you know we were just
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		oh yeah
 		just so thrilled it's true
 	
 	
 		right right when the seem like right before the Christmas holidays or somewhere seem like my mom was there from uh they're from Alabama and my mom has never watched
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		football hardly in her life and she sat there with me and i was explaining some of it to her and she was getting really excited and that was so neat yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		really getting into it uh-huh yeah yeah it's it's it's addictive i mean i come from a my i have several coaches in my family and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know my mom is just a freak about it you know she she's just as bad as anybody and my fiancee if it's involved with ball he will watch it you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i was i was raised with all that stuff so you know it's just like all of our holidays center on what time is the game start you know we have to hurry up and get all this food out of the way because
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		that's kind of kind of the way way we've been too but it's it is fun i really enjoy it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		yeah you know i would like to i i say i have i didn't want the Cowboys to win but sure i'd like to seem them you know end up end up doing better it's just you know you you really miss it when you aren't so intense
 		you know as as we were when they were such a great team you know
 	
 	
 		yeah you kind of i don't know you know when they're not doing well or they consistently do poorly just kind of kind of lose interest if you don't which is a shame but that's uh way people are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah you know it's like why uh-huh
 		uh-huh it's like why am i even watching this you know i it was seems like it was the height of the of the uh Cowboys empire so to speak when uh uh Earl Campbell was playing for the Oilers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i'm a UT freak too i mean i'm a University of Texas fan so i followed Earl Campbell over to the Oilers and and uh you know i kept up with that as well and and i was i was just crazy about him so i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
