 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay uh i really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing but uh just off the top of my head
 		i've i don't think i see much wrong with it um
 		if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had uh coming in uh were trust worthy et cetera and so on i think i would i would uh
 		probably do the random testing just to insure that my company uh runs safely and smoothly
 	
 	
 		yeah um i i also haven't thought too much about it uh but i suspect it it it very much depends upon the job
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		maybe there are some jobs where i guess it doesn't really
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah that
 	
 	
 		i mean it's it's if if it's not affecting someone's performance i'm not sure if it's a problem
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if if it's a position a a position where it could potentially affect
 	
 	
 		that's true i didn't think about that like for instance uh if someone's working on heavy machinery or uh say driving trucks or buses city buses or something like that
 	
 	
 		you know if if
 		right
 	
 	
 		then that is something that affects the affects then affects the community
 		you know if you're if you're drinking or on drugs or whatever you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands
 	
 	
 		that don't
 		right and then if you're a computer operator and uh there's really no big deal i think you know then then then maybe it's not
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		necessary
 	
 	
 		yeah for me i think that drug testing just it it follows the path that society's going in if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean it's just it's just where society is right now and you know something we have to cope with and i think the drug testing is something that drug users have to cope with
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah well i think it it may i mean that in in in that respect i think it may help a lot i think it may be pushing people away from hopefully push people away from drug use if they know that you know well if you use drugs you won't get this job i mean
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 		i think that may be
 		yeah that may be one of the points of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of course i think um i'm not sure you know what the time span is but i mean if i think if i used drugs last week and i had a you know had a job interview that i wouldn't use drugs the day before or something and they wouldn't even see it
 		you know i'm saying they can't they may not be able trace don't know how far you trace i don't know what the you know limits are or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know
 		i don't know the uh that that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think i don't i don't actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system i've heard some you know you so some things supposedly stay for six months some stay for less some stay for longer i mean
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they think LSD i guess stay forever in in in some ways i mean if you get flashbacks for uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		forever
 	
 	
 		oh really hum
 	
 	
 		i i i guess so
 	
 	
 		something like that yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean there must be some
 		some something i mean people people who people get these little little flashback things you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum hum
 	
 	
 		of some sort so i don't really know
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean i i don't use any drugs i don't really drink or anything so i'm pretty uh
 		
 
 		uh i guess decisive about that just the fact that you know if since i don't use drugs i have no problem with taking a test
 	
 	
 		right well the same here actually i don't use drugs at all and i and i'm at at most a social drinker so it's so it's never a problem
 	
 	
 		that just it yeah
 		yeah yeah um-hum
 		so the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and uh i mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector  the lie detector test
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if you don't have anything to hide you're not going to mind it
 	
 	
 		um-hum right
 	
 	
 		you know but for people that
 		you know don't have anything to hide and then there are some things that just aren't people's business you know that they come out at that point so i think a lot of people have trouble with that
 	
 	
 		right that that that uh
 		that's a fine line to draw
 	
 	
 		and i can i can understand that um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean uh that that's really you know do you uh
 		do you worry about you know this or that i mean you know what what what about their rights to privacy well if they're doing something illegal there they have a private you know like especially in in in the case of drinking you know if someone's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		is something more than a social drinker shall we say yet they're not an alcoholic what do you do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i mean i i took a lie detector test once and it didn't i didn't mind it but i was just offended by some of the questions i guess i mean there was one question do you like your mother you know i said yes do you hate your mother no have you ever killed your mother
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i was just going you know what in the world
 	
 	
 		well those are just yeah those it turns out those are just to get a um probably to get some sort of
 		those are to get some shock value out of you or just to see what happens when you get shocked yeah there's uh um i do some i'm a student graduate student in psychology
 	
 	
 		is that what it was i just
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and we sort of you know figure out um
 		i i know a a little bit uh about that kind of stuff and what they try and do there is they want to sort of get base line measures for you you know how is it that when when you see these things and you know and and and they can look at the lines and sort of sort of get an idea
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 		um-hum
 		so it kind of get kind of get something to measure my responses by i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah otherwise they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping around and being fidgety and maybe they say that you would sort of it can be shocking and it they want to see how easy it is shock you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		they ask that i was going what in the world are you asking me about here you know it's just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i guess i don't know some people probably have killed their mothers i don't know but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess so i mean i guess i don't i don't what happens actually actually happens if uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you have killed your mother
 	
 	
 		yeah it's like i
 	
 	
 		you get a big a big jump there you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah it's i think it's their way of seeing how how how well you do in a shock situation without worrying abo ut you know stuff like that so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 		hm okay i never thought about that and that makes me feel a little better  of course that was years and years ago and also i don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and i don't think that you killed your mother though i wouldn't worry about that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't think that some thing i mean there are some people
 		i mean because society a lot of people are taking drugs there is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives
 		but they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever
 		and the stuff that happened to them you know five years ago comes up and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better you know when they might be actually trying to improve their lives you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's uh you know it it it it could blow things right away for them you know unless they say well look i mean unless they walk it won't
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'm thinking walk in and say look i did do drugs you know a year ago and i'm off them for a year now and this and that and so if you take if i take i'll be happy to take the test but it will show up positive of course i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah i would probably do that and i'd probably bring something in showing that i had been to such and such hospital for help or you know whatever the twelve month program or whatever it is that that they do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah because then i mean then although legally they can't discriminate you i think on the basis but i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't i don't really know i don't know what the laws are pertaining to this my wife probably does but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i'm not sure what they are either
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't of this stuff
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but yeah it's it's it's it's an interesting topic that they've actually thought about your right in that it doesn't
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i the other day we had talked about uh
 		capital punishment
 	
 	
 		oh i
 	
 	
 		and i really i really hadn't thought uh thought about it i mean i think about it because i hear about it
 		but i hadn't sit had to sit down and and say well what do i think about it  you know and that's kind of like today i'm not real sure what i think about it i'm kind of you know in in the middle on that one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well these these are tough i i sort of like this it makes you think
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum really really
 	
 	
 		so i think that's that's real good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay it was very nice talking to you okay take care bye-bye
 	
 	
 		well been nice talking to you too
 		bye-bye
