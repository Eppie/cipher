 
     		
 	
 		
  
 		okay Carla can you tell me uh uh what type of movies do you like
 	
 	
 		um
 		well i like uh i guess i like all kinds of movies but the ones i don't like are kind of like Monty Python that type of thing but
 		i like all kinds of movies i like to see movies when they come out and uh
 		i generally prefer watching movies that have the stars that i like like Arnold Schwarzenegger and that type thing
 	
 	
 		oh like the Terminator or
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean those are kind of rough for me sometimes but i still like him as an actor so i like watching those movies
 	
 	
 		i liked uh
 		when he played in Twins did did you see that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i saw it
 	
 	
 		which was out of character for him you know playing such a a softy um i tend to uh i like the lighter movies myself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		rather than the uh the uh tear jerkers i think uh at least for me uh life is full of that stuff you know and it needs some light moments
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		i don't really like the tear jerker type either surprisingly surprisingly even though you know  just seems like
 		i don't know they try to make things sad sometimes that really aren't i don't know why did you see the movie Dad
 		that was a movie that really really was good and really got me
 	
 	
 		um
 		no uh who who was in that
 	
 	
 		uh had it was the guy from Cheers Ted Danson i think was in it that was so good
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah yes yes okay i like him in fact he was up he's he's big into uh uh ecology and he was up to save the Bay you know for uh Narragansett Bay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		so he came i i actually i live in Rhode Island
 		you know i work in Massachusetts because it's not that far away but i live in Rhode Island so but no i didn't see that one i didn't um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we're kind of uh uh we look at the movies and we say yeah we're going to go and see them go and we probably don't usually end up until until they come out on in tape
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then we'll go down to the video store and rent them and and look at them um i like uh
 		
 
 		uh some science fiction movies i liked uh Alien i thought that was good
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and uh uh Two Thousand and One
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know if you've did you
 	
 	
 		see i haven't seen many of those but i do like them i mean no

 		the latest movie was uh
 		Back to the Future part two or three whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah i've seen all those those are pretty good
 	
 	
 		yeah i like him i like
 	
 	
 		i liked the first one best i think
 	
 	
 		they're usually yes the the first movie out is usually the best one and then they try and do other sequels some of the sequels
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some work but most of them don't i think they're trying too hard on the pushing but that seemed to that seemed to be pretty good i don't i don't i liked that um i haven't seen any of the real
 		uh
 		new releases
 		i'm trying to think of uh
 		uh what's out there now
 		actually not there isn't much of anything really uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i've seen like all the movies that come to the dollar theatre there's a dollar theatre in town we don't really pay um five bucks to go to see a movie because they have pretty good movies you know
 		not too long after they've been out at the dollar theatre so we go there we used to go there quite a bit we haven't been there lately very much but i think the last movie i saw was Awakenings
 		have you heard about that
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		it was more like a it was a true story it was based on a true story it's about a
 		it's about a disease that that caused people to go into like
 		total what do you call it  i mean
 	
 	
 		like a like a coma or amnesia or
 	
 	
 		kind kind of like a coma yeah and then they came out of it
 		i won't tell you the rest
 	
 	
 		oh is that um
 		um it was like a life after death experience something similar to that was was
 	
 	
 		no that was Ghost wasn't it  wasn't that Ghost

 		yeah yeah are are you thinking of uh Flatliners
 	
 	
 		yes that's the one right okay okay yeah yeah and they didn't want to come back
 	
 	
 		that was uh life yeah that was good that was real good
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		or or they came back but they weren't really back
