 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh
 		have you did you have you grown up in Dallas Stephanie
 	
 	
 		uh no i've only been here for the last ten years uh
 	
 	
 		oh where are you from
 	
 	
 		i grew up most of my childhood in Germany
 	
 	
 		in Germany
 	
 	
 		uh and we we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance
 	
 	
 		well
 		now there's a place i'd like to visit
 	
 	
 		so we we traveled all over Europe
 	
 	
 		oh that's neat
 	
 	
 		when i was when i was very young unfortunately a a little bit too young to really appreciate
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i was grade school age uh
 	
 	
 		my husband my husband had a bicycle tour of Europe or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war and so we've seen lots of pictures of the of the beautiful spots and areas yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh that
 		that would be a to me a really nice vacation because i'm i'm not in physical shape for something like that but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i sure would work on it  if i had an opportunity like that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's neat neat  what kind of vacations do you like
 	
 	
 		uh well my husband and i are scuba divers
 	
 	
 		oh huh
 	
 	
 		so we both like to go to dive resorts uh we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we dove there uh
 		but we we did about six dives while we were there and uh we were originally planning on going to Cayman
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh last year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip we had to have like eleven people for this package uh deal
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and we couldn't get enough people together
 		uh to go so it ended up falling uh falling through we were going to get a really good price
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		when when our children were younger we enjoyed we lived up in uh New York
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or or New Jersey and and used to like uh traveling into upstate New York and camping
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and
 		that sort of thing but we've never really uh did any diving or anything little bit of sailing of uh uh  oh
 	
 	
 		snorkeling
 	
 	
 		water skiing
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		but not much of uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		of anything else
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well my husband and i both like water so any any vacation that we go on is usually involves close to the ocean or or something like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it's got to be the water
 		when when we were in Jersey we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot it's really they had
 	
 	
 		yeah we
 	
 	
 		a really nice beach areas there
 	
 	
 		after we moved away from Germany we moved to New Hampshire
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i lived there for seven years
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		uh and i really enjoyed that because you know the mountains were real close we like the we like the white mountains and
 	
 	
 		that's a really pretty area too
 		uh-huh
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh unfortunately i didn't really get to go skiing much while i was there i went skiing once
 	
 	
 		yeah we loved the we loved the the New Jersey area too because the  the lakes were really pretty close you know you could
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and and just really and then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail we did quite a bit of hiking
 		which is kind of fun
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		are you a you a hiker or not
 		not so much huh
 	
 	
 		not not really so much if if if there was some place that that we went to where there was hiking involved i i would be
 		you know happy to go hiking but we we never have really planned a vacation around uh places to go hiking
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so your your next your plans are try to find someplace to scuba scuba dive
 	
 	
 		yeah our next vacation will will be scuba diving i'm sure
 	
 	
 		you have any children
 	
 	
 		no not yet
 	
 	
 		okay then that's probably one of the reasons our
 		we had little children all the time so some of the things are not as quite as uh adaptable yeah it is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's a it's a little more difficult planning a vacation when you have have children
 	
 	
 		you have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy too and so i think what
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and diving is something that especially for small children uh i think the the minimum age for diving is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		is probably legal anyway would be probably about sixteen
 	
 	
 		eleven or twelve i would think probably but maybe fifteen even i know that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh one of one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family you know we go wherever somebody is that we haven't seen for a while  so that that's kind of uh we just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		came back from uh uh Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		from uh with his Master's degree in social work and so that was fun and and the summer we have a we have a
 		a reunion in in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where we're going to camp for a week with
 		as many members of of a rather large reunion group that uh as we can get together so
 	
 	
 		that that sounds like a lot of fun our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that there were several hundred uh people and they all kind of met at a central place i i didn't go
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		uh but it would have been nice it would have been a nice vacation
 	
 	
 		we we've traveled we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could
 		stop and sleep maybe you know like a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a small camper we've we've traveled in a big one i hate them  because they're hard to jockey around you know but maybe a pickup with the back on
 	
 	
 		something or something like uh what's the like the Volkswagen Vanagon i've heard is really nice
 	
 	
 		yeah so you could kind of sleep in it
 		sometimes but you wouldn't want to do it all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh we have enough friends here and there i would just love to just drive
 		through the United States and stop and see people i know and visit for a day and then go on and you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		my dad has been talking for years about uh getting a fifth wheel
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and just picking up he's retired uh he's in his sixties and he uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there and just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know not be settled anywhere just see see the rest of the country
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it is
 		i think that would real and i would like to maybe not take great long trips but but have your home base where your home is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then just travel out for like maybe oh
 		a month maybe go
 	
 	
 		he he does that quite a bit he he hasn't lately though uh because he's been ill
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time and you know he'll say this is my itinerary i'm going here here and here and i'll be back in about two months
 	
 	
 		yeah there are a lot of neat neat places to visit in America that's for sure we've i haven't been much to the south i haven't been in in Georgia or Florida
 		or Mississippi or Alabama i guess that's those are the only states i have not visited but uh
 		up the coast uh at uh uh in Maryland and around there where the where the early history is there's some
 		Johnstown and uh in some in that area is just really neat interesting things to so you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh have you been a to a lot of the different historical sites
 	
 	
 		yeah we took a trip uh around to the uh Civil War
 		battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something i believe it was uh had about three kids then i think but that was a really fun interesting trip i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we we read Bruce book before we went you know and so we were ready to look up the places we read about it was really interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah i
 		i think right right now while my husband and i don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can
 		doing things like scuba diving and and adventurous types of things and then when we eventually when we have kids
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now his his folks did a lot of traveling across country you know they went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well now camping is fun with kids
 		if you're you know once they get a little bigger not teeny tiny ones but even even some little ones do pretty good but but when they get a little bigger so they can help that that's a fun way to  to uh cut costs and it's enjoyable too very restful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah i i do enjoy camping
 	
 	
 		i mean i find
 		yeah i find the outdoors very relaxing and you know kind of
 		a change
 	
 	
 		as long as i have a shower nearby i'm fine  and electricity
 	
 	
 		yeah  well i'm with you i need my creature comforts too well it was great to talk to you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it was nice talking to you too Beth
 	
 	
 		okay see you later bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay bye-bye
