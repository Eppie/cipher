 
     		
 	
 		i don't guess we got our first uh credit card oh back in the seventies early seventies uh when i first got married was a Visa card uh issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City because my
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		sister worked at the uh
 		uh the Visa  Bank Americard
 		center there so we were still in college and had she not worked there i'm not sure that i would have qualified
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they've come in handy over the years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and they have become or
 		also a
 		a real bother sometimes
 	
 	
 		oh tell me about it
 	
 	
 		especially you know if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation it's just easier to put everything on a card
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i find if you're not careful you wind up uh a month or so
 		staring those bills in the face and you go i don't remember doing all that stuff and it adds up
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they add up quick
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so sometimes uh especially traveling with TI you know everything goes on American Express
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh as far as personal life goes i guess i really try to use them as little as possible uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i kind of like having them for uh gasoline purchases
 	
 	
 		yeah we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but other than that uh i i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after day after day and then then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		how how do you
 		look at credit credit cards
 	
 	
 		we just uh quit using them  and they got us in trouble we took a loan and paid them all off
 	
 	
 		that's
 	
 	
 		we keep them uh we keep uh one gas card and uh and uh Visa just you know in case there's an emergency or something but other than that we don't use them anymore
 	
 	
 		right
 		well that's kind of the way we were coming it's it's uh i guess for that very reason that that uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if you're not real conscious of what you're doing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's just too much by the time you get well if you got a bunch of cards you get a bunch of bills every month and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i know isn't that funny
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i give them maybe not maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid because they're know if you don't then they're adding on what eighteen nineteen twenty percent sometimes it's twenty two percent interest
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah and then some of them add late fees on it and say they don't get paid and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess that's one of the motivations behind the the uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		huh
 	
 	
 		the uh American Express card with TI there's no with the American Express card from TI there's no um
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh uh
 	
 	
 		late fee there's no uh interest rate you either you either pay the thing off or they come get it
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's turned into personnel and they come get you
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so they've got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		then some of the others do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's the one that your cost center manager sees every month
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so you're
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to
 	
 	
 		
 
 		can you use that one for personal use
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		oh you can
 	
 	
 		you can use it like any other card
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		oh i see huh
 	
 	
 		but it you know you kind of you know that somebody every month and who knows how many people are looking at those uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		bills that come in and those statements you're not the only one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		you uh you want to make sure that
 		uh is that okay is that okay okay that those people see what it is that you are buying and most of the time it is
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but most of the others i've sent back i mean all you get is card offers i've got three card offers now uh from gas companies and uh Visa Gold and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh some other bank uh Citibank i think is always sending the Visa stuff out
 		and i usually just throw them away because i you know
 	
 	
 		oh i do too i don't even open them much i throw them out
 	
 	
 		i don't want another one i don't want to have to mess with it you know you carry around a wallet full of
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		credit cards and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		one of these days it's going to all be full
 	
 	
 		a girlfriend of mine found uh uh it was a Visa or MasterCard she found the ad for one in like a Good Housekeeping Housekeeping magazine for eleven percent
 	
 	
 		oh that's not bad
 	
 	
 		so i said shoot i need one of those
 	
 	
 		yeah no if they don't say no annual membership on them i'll throw them away um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		years ago well that i had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh probably fifteen years and then they star ted charging uh annual membership fees
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i said adios i'm you know i'm not paying you
 	
 	
 		why do they do that
 	
 	
 		it's just another way to make money as far as i can tell i mean they've been
 	
 	
 		i mean
 		i mean they get enough you know on the interest
 	
 	
 		well sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they i guess they figure they've got enough people out there with cards they're going to get cards at uh twenty bucks a pop
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's going to be that much more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh so then a couple years ago i found uh a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account in his name and
 		got my Visa card so as long as they have no annual membership fee i it would be okay but i can't see paying someone to use their card be charged that eighteen percent interests
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 		no i can't either
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so yeah i think you're right the best philosophy is have them if you need them but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah really  gets a lot of people in in trouble
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it sure does maybe they're counting on that i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i guess that's it thanks for talking
 	
 	
 		okay nice talking to you bye-bye
 	
 	
 		bye
