 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		my name is Diane
 	
 	
 		i'm Cliff Penn
 	
 	
 		hi well what's your favorite team i like the Chicago Bears
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i uh don't have uh much much of a favorite team since the Cowboys haven't done much so i guess i'll just have to say the Cowboys
 	
 	
 		the Cowboys well they haven't done much for they never did much  even when Landry and Staubach were playing i'm being real sarcastic  did you like them back then
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um
 		
  
 		oh yeah in fact most of the world liked them back then whether you did or not
 	
 	
 		touch yes well when i moved here in the uh mid seventies um are you in Dallas yes so am i uh i just use to laugh because back then i was a Steelers fan i'm from originally from Pittsburgh
 	
 	
 		yes um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that was not the thing to be in Dallas when they their preseason games at the stadium you know where the Cowboys versus what do you think they're going to do this year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh they may be a little better but uh they got a long way to go
 	
 	
 		uh-huh in
 	
 	
 		after Landry got the shaft
 	
 	
 		he sure did that i agree with you on yeah what do you think of uh the guy who's coaching them now from Miami i can't remember his name off the top of my head i can picture his gray hair but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well they all start with J so yeah he's Johnson right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		well he's he's learned a little bit but the first year he was here he was playing college football and it was pretty simple stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		are you a football fan  uh by nature or is this something you grew into
 	
 	
 		yeah i i in Texas uh football's the game instead of baseball
 	
 	
 		that's true i agree with you there though at least it has a little more action than baseball
 	
 	
 		yep um-hum
 		yep
 	
 	
 		well i don't know why i like the Bears but i do i just think they have some good players but
 	
 	
 		well they've had some very good players and fact uh the best tight end in football is now their coach
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		eighty nine yeah Mister Ditka well you can't say too much bad about him i mean he did learn his hone his trade under Landry
 	
 	
 		well actually he was uh as as a coach he learned his trade under Landry but as uh as a player i remember seeing him as a young man
 	
 	
 		that's what i meant
 	
 	
 		fighting everybody off while he caught a pass on a tight end
 	
 	
 		yeah the University of Pittsburgh well i was probably a little bit too young for that but um i know we just laugh now in terms of not specific teams but um
 		we have company and one of the men got bored earlier this afternoon and he turned on the television and one of the ladies said what's
 		you know what's the football game  and i wasn't even aware i mean i knew it but i just i guess i kind of shut it out like most females   yeah something
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah the the World Football League is playing uh Frank uh playing in Germany i think i've forgotten where they are Germany and somebody that
 	
 	
 		oh funny
 		San Antonio and San Antonio has a team or something
 	
 	
 		yeah Landry is down there over San Antonio now yeah
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding oh goodness are you that avid a fan that you would watch it regular uh year round
 	
 	
 		no no i uh actually i haven't uh watched it as much since uh the Cowboys' demise as i used to i used to watch it every weekend but irregardless of who was playing whether it was Cowboys or not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes it it seemed like it's up to about ten to twelve years ago i mean all the sports including football it used to seem uh before the higher ticket prices in terms of just not for fans but i mean what what the salaries some of the players were getting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah now that it's uh well i think a lot went out of it when they had the strike too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i mean i um i mean like i was just reading something in today's paper about Herschel Walker and i had to chuckle you know i mean you wonder what he really is  i mean i really don't care but what happens to a player when they're sitting in their cars and they fall asleep because um
 		they're so tired and the carbon they're overcome by  carbon monoxide fumes
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's hard to believe all right
 	
 	
 		you know um  but i think it's still healthy i mean i have a nephew that plays football and if that's what he wanted to do i certainly wouldn't tell his parents to encourage it but i think it's still an honorable sport
 	
 	
 		yeah who do you think uh Chicago will have quarterbacking now
 	
 	
 		i have no idea who is he who um the guy the young guy from uh Ohio State i think he's already over the hill isn't he oh i can't remember
 	
 	
 		hum
 		it
 		seems like it
 	
 	
 		i can't even remember his my mind went blank today it must be the heat um
 		i don't know i just uh i actually like you know i was probably was like you were when the when Payton was big you know this is probably about five years after when everything was the America team but um  i actually once Payton left i kind of just lost you know
 	
 	
 		yeah he was a superstar all right
 	
 	
 		yeah i kind of just lost um and i don't think Ditka's going to stay around much longer i don't know if he renewed a two year or not i think he's either in the middle of that or just did that
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems seems like the spice has gone out of it for him
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of you know i mean uh it's it's kind of like when the Cowboys the Bears and the Steelers went you know like i said about ten twelve years ago it seemed like football was really interesting the and it didn't matter who was playing it just it was worth watching
 	
 	
 		yeah there
 		yeah there were several really good teams in that time frame yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah and it was competitive and it seemed a little cleaner i don't know um
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it probably was the uh now then there's a lot of dirty stuff going on on the line that the  that the referees don't call things get out of hand
 	
 	
 		yeah and there's some technical stuff you know this Minicam stuff these instant replay things that uh i'm not sure that i would agree with some of it but i still think it's a good sport
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well actually i think if they'd a had that technical replay technical uh bit where they replayed it at Dallas would've won two Super Bowls that they didn't win because of bad calls hum yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		some of those calls well i have to agree with you because i can remember um when they played the Dolphins and i saw Ditka take the touchdown and i remember there were one or two calls in that game i think it was in seventy was that seventy three or seventy two i can't i can't even go back that far anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah there was one that uh supposedly uh uh
 		fumble after a touchdown and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the Cowboys theoretically lost it but uh  they didn't really  in fact the guy uh who had recovered who was supposed to have recovered it later admitted that he had uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so now i know
 	
 	
 		after it had already crossed the the goal line in the other guy's hand he jerked it out of his hand so it was he admitted that he had done that after the fact but you could see it on camera when it happened but the officials couldn't see it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah usually usually when that happens and i mean it always seems to go the way of the ref's call though it never seems to go the way of you know either the coach or somebody protesting um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but that's really i guess what i know about football
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the where do you work where do you work
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 		right now i'm not i'm a homemaker yeah yeah true
 	
 	
 		you're a homemaker well that's work enough
 		
 
 		my my wife says that is plenty work enough
 	
 	
 		domestic engineering domestic engineering there you go yeah it's um
 	
 	
 		pardon
 		domestic engineering right right
 	
 	
 		i don't know i just really had to laugh today i mean the what the subject was when i placed this call when the subject was football because uh we had just
 		had that on that that was uh you know wear year round and i said oh they've got to be kidding i just don't think financially they'll make a go of it and then my husband said to me well it was somebody from the Vikings uh Mike Lynn or somebody who um was one of the promoters of that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		i said uh you know wouldn't they be defeating their purpose to go away from the NFL
 	
 	
 		yeah i think they would
 	
 	
 		but nobody seemed to uh you know nobody just thought that it so the motive was just another way to make a profit
 	
 	
 		yeah the Vikings to me will always be Fran Tarkenton though
 	
 	
 		yeah actually you know i mean that's just um that's the era i'm talking about i mean i remember when uh Gale Sayers played i i mean i can remember that's kind of when it seems like it was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		any team could beat any other team in that time frame and that's what made it so good yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		right any probability could happen i mean now it's just it's and usually it's one team that's great over the entire season and then it's kind of flat watching some of it i mean it's um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and it's whoever has got the most money that gets the players and so forth
 	
 	
 		right exactly i mean i can remember when drafts and Heisman i mean i could remember i mean i just i mean i used to think Dorsett was good now i look at him and i think well why did i ever think that
 	
 	
 		well he was good in his younger days he really yeah he really was
 	
 	
 		in his younger yeah and Walker now i mean i don't know if he's dried up or not the way they're talking that uh
 	
 	
 		well he's he's getting old enough to be uh his legs wearing out but the last time i saw him play when he was healthy he looked mighty good
 	
 	
 		did he and who's going to quarterback the Cowboys this year i don't even is it still the blonde headed guy Aikman it what do you think of him
 	
 	
 		it'll be it'll be Aikman yeah
 		oh Aikman himself if he had some talent around i think they'd be a super team but he can't do it by himself he's got to have a line in front of him that knows how to block
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so you think it's the defensive element that's really lacking in the Cowboys
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well no i think it's mainly the offense the defense is better than the offense really the the the uh offensive line is is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		in terms of running yeah
 	
 	
 		just hasn't been able to keep down the pass rush at all so that Aikman's had time to get rid of the ball
 		and he's been and the main reason he's been hurt on occasion it's like most of them the offensive line didn't do it's job he got blindsided or something so
 	
 	
 		protecting him yeah didn't he just go through through some rough elbow surgery or something about five months ago
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they found a whole bunch of chips in there that they though though they had one chip and they uh
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they uh got i've forgotten my son keeps up with this more than i in fact he should be on this network he's the one that knows all about sports  yeah
 	
 	
 		sure
 		probably my husband should be too i just you know you just go through and you check those subjects and you go well  there's not too much well listen i won't keep you on a nice Sunday afternoon
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i appreciate the call
