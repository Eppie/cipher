 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and what movies have you seen recently
 	
 	
 		well  we aren't just real big go to the you know first time it comes out kind of thing we neither one like to stand in line
 		so we uh a lot of times will just kind of hold on until it comes to a dollar theater or
 	
 	
 		i don't blame you we're the same
 	
 	
 		something or maybe rent the video although i prefer the dollar theater because it is kind of fun and
 		i say dollar theater i think they're actually two dollars these days
 	
 	
 		right  there's been inflation all the way along
 	
 	
 		it's like saying go to the five and dime you know it's not five and dime anymore but the
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a analogy is there
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but um uh we have teenagers and we have we have a guideline i shan't say rule  that uh you know we like to see the movies that they want to see first
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		um
 	
 	
 		so that we can kind of talk about it and decide whether it's really appropriate or
 		you know or not and uh  we're probably stricter than most parents i know we are because i know that my children's friends even the youngest ones routinely see things that
 	
 	
 		well i know that my kids have gone to things that i would never set foot in but they haven't gone with me and i haven't paid the bill
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so there's are there are an awful lot of movies that i just think are uh unconscionable to be shown on
 		especially to kids and i have had to hope that they would enforce the R ratings and not let kids under eighteen in
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum and i don't really think they do i mean uh
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 		
 
 		we're having an pollen attack here and i'm having hay fever excuse me
 	
 	
 		oh bless your heart i've i've have a throat that is so sore i know exactly what you mean just from that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		but anyway anyway um my kids are now twenty one and twenty four so i don't have to
 	
 	
 		with absolutely no you know
 	
 	
 		do anything now
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but once in a while what i try to do is try to entice them into something that i think is going to be
 		useful or educational or something so the two
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		recent recent films that we have seen where i've been able to drag them along um are the uh Henry the Fifth the Kenneth Bronoff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		version and Rosencranz and Gilgenstern are Dead
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		which were wonderful
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		both of them were just outstandingly good
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		excellent acting wonderful sets costumes and really worthwhile
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum we uh
 		i guess probably the last one that we really paid full price for was um
 		oh the Russian one that they made the book
 	
 	
 		hum
 		i'm a bad one to ask because i don't
 	
 	
 		i think the submarine the uh with Sean Connery there we go
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes i know the one you're talking about Hunt for Red October yes
 	
 	
 		there we go which i was so glad that uh
 		my husband had read the book before we went because otherwise he you know he had to kind of sit and explain it along the way to me that uh you know that uh i thought it was very well done though uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh yes
 		well uh my husband went and took his son and he enjoyed it a lot but i've never cared much for war and spy movies so they let me stay home and work in the garden
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 		that was  a a nice trade
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but they thought it was a good movie and uh i like Sean Connery so i said if it comes out on video i'll be willing to pay the two dollars to rent it and then if i'm bored i don't feel like i've lost a lot and i can turn it off
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		that's right
 		that's right we uh have have have thoroughly enjoyed the uh
 		Dancing with Wolves
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that was uh
 		i guess we paid full price for that one too
 	
 	
 		well i
 	
 	
 		that one was very unnerving for me i uh i have an American uh native American heritage and
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i knew going into it that it
 		was probably affect me deeply
 	
 	
 		um-hum um
 	
 	
 		and i was right  it definitely did definitely did it definitely did
 	
 	
 		well uh i have to tell you a comment that the man whose office is next door to mine goes to a lot of movies and uh he will come back with his capsule review and he said
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well it has absolutely beautiful scenery but you wouldn't like it because of the cruelty to animals and any movie i have to say i where i notice the scenery means i didn't like the plot
 		so
 	
 	
 		well i have to agree with you it that that part of it was somewhat unnerving although
 		it was cruelty to animals yes but not
 		kinds of things
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		you know it was
 		very much in the natural
 		you know the way it really probably was not some sadistic
 		crazed person you know who's going around pulling the wings off flies and birds  you know swinging cats by their tail not not that kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh torturistic type thing you know it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it it was awfully graphic
 		that way but
 	
 	
 		well i keep telling people that i don't go to movies where there's lots of blood and uh shootings and i certainly don't go to horror films
 	
 	
 		oh yes i agree
 	
 	
 		oh i
 		if they are are trying on purpose to scare me then i don't want to go
 	
 	
 		i'm certainly not going to give them money to do it
 	
 	
 		absolutely not oh i'll tell you one though that i heard such good things about um
 		oh let's see what was it um
 		it's a David Lynch
 		movie and it's about
 		Sailor and Lula they're the two characters main characters i can't remember the name of the film now
 	
 	
 		well i'll
 	
 	
 		but anyway got lots of just wonderful reviews and i had heard that it had violence in it but i thought well i'll go give it a try
 		and the first five minutes of that movie were so disgusting that i went and got my money back
 	
 	
 		said i'm leaving
 	
 	
 		i did i told my husband i've got a book in the car give me the car keys you can stay and watch this if you want to but i don't need this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i just got up and left and in about two more minutes he joined me and we asked for ou r money back i said you know i i realize that this is advertised as an R movie
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and i had heard that it contained violence but i had no idea
 	
 	
 		that this was what i was getting myself into
 	
 	
 		how disgusting this was going to be and in the five minutes i watched there was no let up it was it was just filthy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah and there's
 	
 	
 		and now i don't mind uh nudity and i don't mind
 		suggestiveness if it's appropriate to the story i'm not a prude and i'm not a prig but i do not see any reason why
 		you should have one string of filthy language with no intermission in it and uh graphic violence and blood and uh it total disregard for human beings
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		one of the i read something here just a while back about it was a newspaper thing just about the movie moguls and the
 		television writers and what not that basically
 		they individually personally are not even close to living the lives that the normal American person does that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		we uh
 		excuse me
 	
 	
 		and i think that's got to be true if you look at what they produce  that they think is the ideal normal person
 	
 	
 		so how could they possibly you know so when they do find something that relates to
 		some of us you know it's just kind on the seedy
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		side of our lives you know it's not the uplifting
 	
 	
 		yeah and most of us aren't that seedy
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly  we're a lot more mundane and humdrum and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		at least the ones with the money to go to the movie
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know we uh we saw that little Home Alone with our children at Christmas
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		you know thoroughly enjoyed that but it was uh you know
 	
 	
 		i heard that was real cute
 	
 	
 		totally different you know kind of thing and even in that there were a few things that had i been making it i wouldn't have put in you know so  but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you know we uh we
 		try to you know catch things when they come back on the television and they're redone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so that the bad language is out and the heavier scenes are
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		removed for the kids we rent a lot of the old musicals and Broadway type things you know for the kids to watch here at home and try to
 	
 	
 		there's a theater here in town that has uh been renovated by a foundation to its heyday of the twenties and it has the big old organ and everything and the big screen and they show only movies made before nineteen fifty
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh how fun
 		oh how fun
 	
 	
 		and it is just great we go to that probably once a month or more
 		uh at the very beginning when they were having film festivals like a Katherine Hepburn festival and a Fred Astaire festival and so on we were going a couple of nights a week
 		and it's great for one thing it's not
 	
 	
 		i wish they'd do something like that in Dallas
 	
 	
 		well it's not full of rowdy teenagers who are uh spilling their Cokes and throwing their popcorn and talking all the time mostly middle age folks who are pretty decorous and sit still and listen to the film
 	
 	
 		that's true but
 		
 
 		that's cute
 	
 	
 		and they get these absolutely terrific prints that are from the uh film archives in Los Angeles that have just been specially restored and sometimes they are made from the original negatives so they're really crisp and good
 		so they're really crisp and good like they were when they first came out
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh that's neat though that's you know that's good i wish more teenagers would take up some of those that they realize that they can be entertained and
 		and enjoy a
 	
 	
 		and you can go to a movie like that and you know that it's going to be entertaining and it's going to have some wit in the dialogue
 	
 	
 		evening's activity
