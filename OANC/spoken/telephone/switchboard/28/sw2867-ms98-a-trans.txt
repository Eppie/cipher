 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you have any interest in gun control do you would you like to start first uh go ahead oh yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		well i thought it was interesting that they gave us a scale um i have to kind of think about that as to exactly where i stand i'm more uh more against gun control than pro i think probably
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess i would pick a five i'm not quite sure i i share an interest of of of guns and i have some guns and i have two brothers-in-law who when we get together we go plinking and and one of them hunts and so it's talked about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't quite understand the NRA's uh CIA type stand it seems to me they'd be
 		guns can become an a hobby and it they they take the approach of uh too too hard nosed on it and i don't quite understand i don't i i i mean i my brother-in-law hunts and and he doesn't need a automatic or semiautomatic gun to hunt
 	
 	
 		agreed agreed
 	
 	
 		and i don't quite understand the the Uzis and all that i think those should be banned i think that uh you oh yeah hunters uh should get whatever they think they need but heck we've had hunting rifles rifles for a hundred years and so uh
 	
 	
 		the military type things
 	
 	
 		they're certainly not Uzis and things like that you know
 	
 	
 		no no i come from a family of hunters and and lots of brothers i have five brothers and and they've all hunted and and
 		my uh in fact i didn't ever even hardly ever even eat beef until i was about five or six years old as
 		my daddy's theory was if you hunt it you better eat it until it's gone and then you go to the grocery store and buy what you need and so we always ate venison and it's still just about my favorite meat
 	
 	
 		oh that's uh
 		oh yeah that i think that's great that's a great attitude
 	
 	
 		and my husband has bow hunted through the years as well as uh hunt with a gun but pretty much now our theory is
 		you know we'll shoot with a camera unless we need to we you know we both know how to hunt and take care of meat if that occasion should ever arise for our family and we own guns we really have not uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		this isn't just really great hunting country i mean you know there's not a lot of access you almost have to go like to an indoor range or something to to be able for your children to learn gun safety
 	
 	
 		no
 		right
 	
 	
 		in a safe situation because you assume have to assume in my mind that anyplace that's out far enough where you could shoot
 		somebody else can be out there plinking at you and your kids you know i've never allowed my boys to have BB guns which by the time my brothers were my sons' ages
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know they had plenty of BB guns and used them and everything on you know and it was kind of that you know same kind of theory then you know that uh if you shot it you better figure figure out a way to bring it home and eat it or better not ever let mother know that
 	
 	
 		they had twenty twos
 		yeah well i agree
 	
 	
 		you know that you were out you know indiscriminately taking out birds or squirrels or whatever
 	
 	
 		right you're absolutely there there you go i think that's a that's a i
 	
 	
 		but on the other hand we've eaten a lot of raccoon and possum and turtle all kinds of
 	
 	
 		you've eaten raccoon and possum
 	
 	
 		all my i have a little grandmother in Oklahoma and you know that's she'll cook anything if you bring it in and you know that's and so my brothers would always hunt those things and
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness and
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know we're a little more but on on the other hand i i don't have a whole lot of patience with people who who don't want to talk about that kind of the end of animals and yet they're more than willing to go up to Skaggs or you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		Kroger or whatever and buy their chicken and their meat and come home and cook it And you start talking about hunting and they just cringe and
 		you know ooh you know i i i don't go for that you know i that to me is the other end of the coin that's hiding your head in the sand
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah and i i
 	
 	
 		you know i i have a respect for life and for meat i eat it sparingly but when i eat it i know that you know something something had to die for it so even if it was in a butcher lot
 	
 	
 		i uh i don't i don't
 		i don't know why the NRA i always said i'm uh probably a five although i haven't really that's not a very well thought out uh since they gave a number system
 		uh my brother-in-law one of them hunts and the other one is a real collector and we get together we go shooting and i've been a lot of plinking and uh as a kid you know as a teenager we'd go to the rifle range and everything and shoot twenty twos and everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		problems we have in society is like today some teenager locally here in the Metroplex
 		used a a twenty two whatever and uh you it's on the news if you listen to the news tonight and went after his teacher and fired three or four shots uh at the school now
 		to me gun control is not going to control it but the parents you know a teenager you know below eighteen or whatever the age should be right uh guns should be an adult should be responsible now i think that if you have a gun an adult
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		how do they get access to that kind of thing you know where
 	
 	
 		then you have a responsibility for whether you call it locking it up or putting it somewhere where absolutely no teenager can get to it
 	
 	
 		or a little child i mean think of the times we've seen
 	
 	
 		that's oh well that includes little kids too yeah
 	
 	
 		you know a criminal a criminal element is kind of out of my realm i mean personally
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i i don't i don't have anybody in my family's ever gone to jail i i've never  known anybody personally who used a gun against themselves or
 		you know or or someone else except well i guess i have in a couple of cases of suicide but still that's not exactly the criminal element that i think of as
 		you know what i am saying go down to the local 7-Eleven and
 	
 	
 		right
 		i'm not sure it should be part of a crime bill i think i i i think guns need controls intelligent controls but i don't think it has maybe a one percent relationship directly to crime
 		uh buying Uzis and all that may you know i think that the cops should have the best weapons and whatever they need but i don't think the average uh plinker or hunter needs to go out and buy be able to buy that i don't think he should uh
 		be allowed to buy an Uzi or something
 	
 	
 		and and i understand that these magazines you know and whatnot that cater to that crowd are very uh you know the mercenary kinds of
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		things i can't think of some of the names right off but i've heard them that they're just replete with advertisements for these really uh
 		militarily sophisticated types of weapons mercenary type things is what i think of
 	
 	
 		i know it's it's shooting against people you know they go out i i've seen them on TV and they actually have these little clubs where they go out and practice shooting each other you know i mean uh yeah and i i think uh it should be in the hunting realm
 	
 	
 		and targets yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know why the NRA doesn't have nice range you talk about a range you're right ranges are hard to we have them here in Arlington i have one here in Fort Worth i go to but uh i would think the R NRA would take the positive side and open up some nice
 		practice ranges and teach it you know and rather than just uh try to  lobby for it you know they they ought to be come out in the open uh and open up some maybe they do have a lot of good ranges but the ones i go to are just ranges you know i don't
 	
 	
 		well there used to be uh i grew up in Irving we live in Plano now there used to quite a few along the Trinity River Bottom and whatnot that you could go to and out in Euless and uh
 		area uh um out off one fifty seven and you know those are just es extinct now not even available you know they've been built up so much around it's no longer
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well my my
 		my brother-in-law's in San Antonio and he uh they're they're closing the the ranges they're slowly but surely closing so when i go here in Fort Worth it's in south part of Fort Worth it is run very well of course it has guns uh to buy
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but they have a state trooper i guess he's in his spare time he's always there with a forty five automatic on his side so that that's the only range i've been to that has a cop there
 	
 	
 		and yet you know i would think that a practice shooting range the kind of people that it would generate is the last place you probably really have a problem with guns
 	
 	
 		right no i think that's the i've seen him there are some real amateurs that yeah there's some real amateurs that come i saw one one time when somebody came with with a
 	
 	
 		but it's a nice thought you know
 	
 	
 		non-hunting one of these and he was just swinging you know swinging moving it around waving it around well pardon me
 	
 	
 		so is he there for instruction then is he there for instruction the trooper
 	
 	
 		no he's just there to uh tell everybody hey this is where you aim and watch it you're putting you're endangering the rest of the people
 	
 	
 		ward off trouble
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and of course when you go and take your targets down he's there to make sure that people uh that's what it was people did not totally totally unload their guns when you you when you take your targets down you walk in front of your own guns
 		and he would just look over everyone's shoulder and say hey your your gun's not unloaded you know you have to unload because you walk out there uh in this particular range uh uh in Fort Worth now the other ranges it's always somebody else but
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
  
 	
 	
 		the the inspector would come by and say or the rifle range uh owner would come by and look at everyone's gun before he would step in front of you and so you need some sort of common sense as well as expertise with a gun before you put a bunch of dummies out there in front with guns now
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		well i've been very happy with uh you know the
 		the education that my boys have gotten uh through scouting uh they're and my husband they're all scouters and you know a lot of times those things are encouraged you know at uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that's great yeah
 		that's a good question yeah the i own i have girls so they haven't been in scouts does does scouting have a gun section where they they teach them twenty twos and all that oh that's great that's great i think that's the way it should be
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum see there's scout camps and whatnot but once again you know they don't run a range you know that uh but that still is you know all of that i guess is secondary to
 	
 	
 		they just plink
 	
 	
 		to that criminal mischief element they're always going to create and find something to do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i again that's why i don't think it should be part of a criminal or a crime bill because they
 	
 	
 		a legislative type thing i i  the ones that want them are always going to get them and the ones that
 		the ones that might need them sometime i mean it's probably just going to make it more difficult you know for
 	
 	
 		yeah but we have to look ahead because we we've had the two hundred years worth of uh or more longer rather we came over with guns four hundred years i guess you might say and i think we have to look at it as it's not going to solve it next week we just got to look uh
 	
 	
 		not now  not now
 	
 	
 		for the next ten or twenty years you know what kind of gun uh not controls gun uh legislature should we have and then it'll slowly change it's going to take twenty five years or so
 	
 	
 		
   
 	
 	
 		maybe to get the the the the guns into a controlled atmosphere where the true hunter you know it has a registered gun and people that allow other children to to get access to a gun should be fined you know
