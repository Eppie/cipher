 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh so what do you like best about golf
 	
 	
 		i like to watch golf my husband plays golf and i've i've really become
 		fairly acquainted with the game it's pretty interesting to watch i think my favorite part of the game is the putting part
 	
 	
 		really
 		really
 	
 	
 		uh-huh do you play
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i play uh i play probably four or five times a week my my wife and kids
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		don't like it too much but
 	
 	
 		well i've already
 	
 	
 		it's such a great game i i i play three you know thirty six holes after work
 	
 	
 		good heavens
 	
 	
 		and then uh
 	
 	
 		it must stay light out there pretty well
 	
 	
 		yeah it does in the summertime in the winter it's too you know but uh you know i go to the indoor driving range all all winter and uh
 	
 	
 		in the summer well yeah in the summer uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i practice putting and it's it's a fun game
 	
 	
 		there's a place here in Dallas it's called Dave and Buster's
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and they have a laser well it's like lasers golf game
 		where there's three beams and you take your clubs and you hit the ball and they give you a screen of what you would be seeing from where you lie
 	
 	
 		that sounds great
 	
 	
 		it's really a lot of fun and it's it's fairly comparable to some of the nicer golf courses around here the nicer public courses the price of it is
 		if you're ever in Dallas you'd have to go to Dave and Buster's
 	
 	
 		well i have to do that because i love golf and
 	
 	
 		it is a very fine game i think it teaches a lot of good uh a lot of good uh
 		attributes
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		to people
 	
 	
 		Cathy is that your name Cathy um
 	
 	
 		yeah you got it right
 	
 	
 		do you
 		do you uh
 		do you have a favorite golfer
 	
 	
 		do i have a favorite golfer
 	
 	
 		professional golfer excuse me my wife is making fun of me
 	
 	
 		oh  talking about golf on the T I thing
 	
 	
 		yeah she hates it when i you know she thinks it's funny that i got golf as a topic because you know she dislikes it so much so
 	
 	
 		uh when you start up on golf
 		well you probably picked it though on your list of of topics to speak about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i would say that my favorite golfer is Greg Norman
 	
 	
 		Greg Norman why
 	
 	
 		there's just something about the way he plays golf he just approaches the ball
 		so confidently
 		and the way he hits he's just really he's got kind of a funny swing but beyond that he's really he seems a very confident player and he does
 		he does play fairly well
 		what about yourself
 	
 	
 		are you sure you're not attracted to him or anything
 	
 	
 		well that may be too he's he's not the most attractive guy on the on the tour  i'll say that but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess after watching
 		for so long for so long i've been i've been watching and hearing about golf from my husband for
 		six years six and a half years or a little more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and after a while you get to where yeah you start watching who plays well and who doesn't i think Tom Kite is another good player
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i like Tom he's good
 	
 	
 		he's got a real ugly stance but
 	
 	
 		yeah i'll agree with you there Cathy
 	
 	
 		he does he he does play real well and he he seems to almost always win
 	
 	
 		yeah he does
 	
 	
 		so he's so that's got to say a lot for him right there that he just wins quite often
 		what about yourself who is your favorite player
 	
 	
 		uh  i'd have to say uh
 		i i still like the Golden Bear you know
 	
 	
 		even on the even on the senior tour
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i i like the senior tour i i think it's got more personality
 	
 	
 		well yeah well the guys have
 	
 	
 		you know and the names don't change every week you know
 	
 	
 		the there's one thing that's true yeah you can always count on Lee and Chichi and Don January and
 	
 	
 		so
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and uh oh yeah the Golden Bear out there hitting them up
 	
 	
 		sure
 		really
 	
 	
 		putting them in
 	
 	
 		my kids
 		do you have kids Cathy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i have a young boy
 	
 	
 		i'm starting them off young i'm gonna get them oh you got a boy good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh he already plays golf he's not eighteen months and he golfs around the house
 	
 	
 		he does has he got a pretty good stance
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no he's horrible but  but he loves
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		to he's got a a set of three little plastic clubs and little plastic balls and he takes his club and he whacks the ball around the house and he whacks the cat and then he'll get a big play ball and bounce it around with his club
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but he really enjoys taking them out and he likes to watch his daddy practice swing and putt around the house so
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm already a golf widow and i don't mind it i mean i know where my husband is when he's out
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		and he's in a very wholesome environment while he's out there so
 	
 	
 		that's true he's out getting some sunshine anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it's
