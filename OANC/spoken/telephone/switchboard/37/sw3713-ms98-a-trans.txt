 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh do you cook quite a bit
 	
 	
 		uh not really actually uh i live by myself and so most of my cooking is pretty basic you know just for myself but i cook when i go home my mom doesn't like to cook so
 		i cook all my parents' meals when i go home and that's about the only opportunity i like to but i just you know
 	
 	
 		that's good practice though
 	
 	
 		hard to get motivated to cook for yourself
 	
 	
 		i know when i was single it was uh i wouldn't cook much of anything i think one night i sauteed a pound of mushrooms and that was dinner
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh well right now my husband and i live in uh uh subdivision that we have a dinner club thingy
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and what we do is once a month we'll meet at one house and the host will prepare the entree and provide the drinks and then every one else brings something
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and then it rotates from month to month you get together with four couples so you only host one time
 	
 	
 		that's pretty nice
 	
 	
 		it is really nice but uh
 	
 	
 		well what kind of things do you usually have i mean do you do you usually have like
 		you know ethnic food do you try a different thing every time or
 	
 	
 		well
 		we haven't but i think that'd be great you know do Mexican one time or Chinese the next time thinking the next one we get into that i'll do that
 		but basically the host so far have just been picking you know what we have and then they'll let the people know and they'll uh uh ask people to bring something to compliment it but personally i like to prepare something that i could have done ahead of time
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		because i can't talk and cook at the same time uh if i tried you know i i leave ingredients out  but uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		we're suppose to be hosting next time i'm thinking of about having beef stroganoff because i can do that ahead of time
 	
 	
 		oh yeah my mom does that and freezes it a lot of times
 	
 	
 		and
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		now now is this one of the dishes that you cook
 	
 	
 		huh-uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		one of my mom's bailiwick
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's really simple so don't don't let it uh
 	
 	
 		i was going to say i kind of i do not know i do
 		odd things i guess
 	
 	
 		what do you cook when you go home
 	
 	
 		um i guess last time i was home was at Christmas and i cooked um
 		i bought some really good beef tenderloin at um Ralph's in Snider Plaza
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um i had i my parents have a deep freeze so i bought like oh God i want to say it was like four pounds and put it in the deep freeze and so i cooked one of them you know and
 		basically have you ever used that DV sauce
 	
 	
 		no what is it
 	
 	
 		it's like um
 		a meat a beef enhancer or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean it might not i i haven't really looked at the ingredients and it may be one of those things where if if
 		it may have MSG in it i really haven't really looked i do not think it does but it might but
 	
 	
 		that doesn't bother me anyway so
 	
 	
 		uh you know i kind of like sprinkle some of that on it  and then take like
 		you know pieces of cloves of garlic and sort of push them down into the meat
 	
 	
 		oh you sound like my husband he's a garlic freak too
 	
 	
 		and then yeah and then bake it you know and it it always turns out really good i mean course you know the better the the the quality of the meat the better it turns out but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and if you can leave it out on the counter for a little bit and you know to soak in the the garlic and everything you know that works pretty well but you know that's kind of that's kind of basic and i can do some Chinese and junk like that but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do you uh stir fry
 	
 	
 		some sometimes um i had one but i loaned it to somebody and they never gave it back
 	
 	
 		do you have a wok
 		well i'd call them up
 	
 	
 		so i kind of just use a skillet really
 	
 	
 		probably works just as well
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		that's something you know we don't do all that often and every time we do it i think why don't we cook this way more often because it is healthy you get a lot of vegetables and everything
 	
 	
 		sure and the easy see now that would be an easy thing to do for the dinner party because you could do that in advance you know you i would just get like um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you could use do chicken or beef either one and you know kind of chop it up into about inch cubes you know and the marinade i think that is like um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh like a cup of water and maybe three tablespoons of
 	
 	
 		soy sauce
 	
 	
 		soy and one tablespoon of Lea and Perrins or Worcestershire Worcestershire sauce or whatever sauce i can't pronounce it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i always call it Lea and Perrins because i can't say the name of it and uh garlic and chopped green onions and then you know chop up all of your meat like the night before and stick it in a tupperware dish with the
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know with the stuff and let it marinade over night and then just strain out you know the juice and um
 		you know then then you know stir fry the meat and um you can get the cans of sliced water chestnuts and bamboo shoots and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you can put mushroom
