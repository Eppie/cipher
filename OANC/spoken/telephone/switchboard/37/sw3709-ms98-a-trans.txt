 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah huh
 	
 	
 		all right
 		um exercise huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um as a matter fact i work out in the mornings i belong to Presidents and uh i've got a routine for every morning of the week and i don't work out on Saturday or Sunday
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i do a i do a combination of uh uh running and weight training
 	
 	
 		they set that up for you
 	
 	
 		no i i actually i just you know joined on my own and i've been thinking about getting with a uh one of their counselors just so see what uh what they might have to offer as far as you know alternatives
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i pretty much uh  worked on my own routine
 	
 	
 		and uh what kind of running do you do
 	
 	
 		they've got the track on the inside and uh i run one mile on Monday Wednesdays and Fridays and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays i run two miles
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then after that i work out with weights
 	
 	
 		is it just aerobic or
 	
 	
 		uh and i work out with free weights
 	
 	
 		no i mean the running
 	
 	
 		oh uh yeah it's really uh aerobic work out part
 	
 	
 		you do it you do a mile in about eight minutes or less
 	
 	
 		uh about seven minutes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and then you wouldn't then you don't get um out of breath
 	
 	
 		uh no i do  yeah that's that's a pretty good pretty good clip and i'll be i'm pretty winded by the time i get done
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		but i mean he's just not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i i could i could probably go faster but then i'd wear myself out  and i wouldn't be able to work out anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah how about you
 	
 	
 		yeah i i don't run much any more i did when i was in school i right now i just lift um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		weights and and do push ups and sit ups and and i jump rope a little bit and that's about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't i don't lift any heavy weights uh they're about a third of my body weight
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		so just uh just try and keep them uh i guess uh firm and
 	
 	
 		yeah and um um i play the trumpet and uh the more
 		upper body strength the easier it is to play you you have to do a you have to do a whole lot of sit ups and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's true
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then i i hurt my neck uh about three years ago so you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um hurting yourself when you play high
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 		i see
 	
 	
 		you have to you have to do it correctly it's you know it's like an exercise in itself but a lot of people uh strain themselves doing it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh i see uh so you're in uh in part of a band
 	
 	
 		um i play at church
 	
 	
 		oh i see i see i used to play an instrument when i was in in high school but it wasn't the trumpet  so i was just wondering if that's what it was or something
 	
 	
 		and
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		well yeah
 	
 	
 		so you you have any plans of maybe running running more when the weather gets nicer
 	
 	
 		well yeah well the weather's nice except for when it rains you know i mean in Dallas yeah i keep thinking about it but that doesn't that doesn't get it done i i i mostly jump rope more you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um-hum yeah i used to do a little bit of jumping rope and uh when i was uh a while back i was more into basketball and uh i used to do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh but it's been a while since i've done that
 	
 	
 		yeah i i do a toe lift and squats for that but you know i it it doesn't um
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		it doesn't um
 		accustom your your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you're running for a long time they they tend to tighten up whenever you whenever you have to do something at a at a great length of time
 	
 	
 		right right
 		um-hum
 		yeah i i that's true i've noticed that uh
 	
 	
 		and it also builds too much mass if you just you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so and it's like i i lift weights with about the the same curl weight as i do the squats with
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um then it doesn't bother me very much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah huh that's that's interesting though i you know i've been thinking of changing i've done the same routine for almost two years now and i'm thinking it of changing it up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh that's why well you know i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and see what different exercises they could get me on to get out of the routine
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		because i've heard that you know you get locked into routines and you're gonna hit this up point where you just stop developing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i'm looking at changing things a little bit
 	
 	
 		yeah that's i i started doing more push ups and it it's helped a lot and then i add sets to it so that i don't like you said wear it out i don't try to push it to the end in one set
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
