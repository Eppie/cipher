 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay and you want to talk about this weather wow i wanna talk about how mild it was at Christmas time
 	
 	
 		yeah it's something else
 		yeah how about that huh
 	
 	
 		well that was uh totally unbelievable for the first time in a long time i left plants outside and they didn't freeze  so that was pretty good um yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 		yeah that's true uh the i think it was last year around this time it was when we had the really really hardened cold snap
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i had a pipe break on me so it flooded the house and everything
 	
 	
 		oh you did oh that's terrible
 	
 	
 		so i was trying to be prepared this time around
 	
 	
 		well what'd you do to prepare for that
 	
 	
 		uh well it was an outside pipe so now this time i made sure i wrapped them up real good um-hum
 	
 	
 		i see
 		oh you did oh good for you uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't wanna go through that again
 	
 	
 		no i um that happened to a friend of ours actually they have a condominium and um they they went out to the grocery store and were out for oh a couple of hours
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and when they came home the the pipe had broken and their their ground floor was flooded so uh it it's it's a major horror when when that kind of thing occurs
 	
 	
 		ah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		well with us we were out of town over the Christmas holiday and our neighbor called us to say hey you guys did you leave the water running
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 		oh oh no uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah they saw the the water coming out from under the door
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness isn't that terrible thing yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah so we cut our vacation short but  i guess it wasn't too bad uh we ended up getting all new carpet downstairs and part of the upstairs so
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 		yeah oh oh my goodness well
 	
 	
 		it wasn't it wasn't a real pleasant but uh you know looking back it it was a good deal because we did need new carpet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well you know sometimes in a funny kind of way life treats us like that that something we wouldn't normally do when we're placed in the circumstance we go ahead and do it and then
 		uh things are kind of better afterwards and it it ultimately gives you an uplift i i i guess you have to look at it like that anyway or you might get depressed  and God forbid  but anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh we had visitors from New York i'm really not from this area you must detect that i'm really originally from the New York area and we had visitors uh both from New York and from California at Christmas time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um usually it is uh somewhat cold i mean cold enough to put on a winter coat or at least heavy sweaters and it was so mild here that uh they had to of course
 	
 	
 		sure sure
 		
 
 	
 	
 		poke several funny jokes at us down here with this funny weather and you know whatever uh but uh i think they were very uh pleasantly happy because one person has um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh arthritis kind of stuff and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when it gets very cold they all crink up you know  and uh we didn't have any of that kind of problem this year so we were uh very grateful for that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		that's great
 		yeah  so you had the kind of weather that uh it was nice to go out at night on
 	
 	
 		that's right um-hum yeah uh-huh of course in California they have such a steadily more moderate climate that the temperatures even in the areas around San Francisco we used to live
 	
 	
 		yeah that's great
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		down in that Bay area the temperatures never got excessively cold if it got down around thirty two just about
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh then the people would start panicking over the artichoke uh crops and uh avocados and of course down south the
 	
 	
 		hum oh
 		i see
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the orange groves and things like that you know the weather really does have a lot of effect upon so many things and um when they grow those oranges down in the southlands they have these
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		braziers out in the field and they go around putting fires on if the temperatures gets down around thirty two or thirty and just levels off there so that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 		wow
 	
 	
 		they can regulate it by means of those like man made not too difficult um uh ways to to save the crops
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we all know what happens if those crops freeze uh we pay for it  yeah
 	
 	
 		right right  that's right you know uh you you usually don't think of that uh you know being i guess being in a urban area if it gets cold you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you you well let's think about water freezing and pipes breaking but down there they got all those crops to worry about
 	
 	
 		right of course uh-huh
 		oh oh yes oh it's it's really well that happened here in Texas with the grapefruits that year a couple of years ago
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah right i remember that
 	
 	
 		and the grapefruit crop was very uh very scarce uh so uh you know all of these major things the poor farmers but um
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway we'll just uh hope that uh we're not in for too many big freezes now but i know one big one will come
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and in it always does and uh i really don't mind those uh few uh snow flurries and those few days when there's a bit of snow
 	
 	
 		it always happens huh
 		
 
 		always happens huh
 		sure i'd say there's pretty quite pretty
