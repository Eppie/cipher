 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		okay what do you do consider as as camping
 	
 	
 		well um
 		we've done a lot of tent camping that's probably the closest definition that i usually think of but um there are a couple of places in the San Francisco area that are considered environmental campsites that are
 		sort of like rustic cabins they have no um electricity and no water
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but there's usually a pot belly stove or something like that and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you can spread out sleeping bags on on uh wooden surfaces so
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		it's a pseudo cabin but they call it environmental camping
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum well the only camping the only camping i've done really is living in a tent we used used to go to Lake Shasta like fifteen years in a row
 	
 	
 		we really enjoy that
 		oh that's beautiful
 	
 	
 		and uh you know take everything up there park our car unload the car and then go by boat to the camp spot you know two or three trips back to the car to unload everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh the
 	
 	
 		is it one  when you've been there is it one of those uh state park arrangements where
 	
 	
 		no no it was just a little camp spot that we found our you know by ourselves and it was usually in a little place called Calucci Creek
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um you know we put up our eating tent our john tent and our sleeping tent
 		and uh slept in in the tent you know on
 	
 	
 		i don't think i've ever seen a john tent that's
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		that's more rustic camping perhaps than i've done usually where someplace where we're sort of close to
 	
 	
 		you know what it is it's actually one of those little tents that you take to the beach and you set up to change your clothes in that's what we use to put around our john
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		that's great  do you usually spend then quite a few days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it was like two weeks
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		how do you like that i don't think i've ever been camping quite that long that seems like
 	
 	
 		uh it was
 	
 	
 		without showers and all you how how did you
 	
 	
 		well just it was it was nice for a while but after fifteen years i got tired of it
 	
 	
 		how did you enjoy that
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and then my next my next vacation trip was to Hawaii
 	
 	
 		so it was sort of an annual thing every year for a while
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		sounds like fun thing about Shasta too is there's so many other things that you can do
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		i've never gone anyplace else really except Lake Shasta camping you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh is Patterson fairly close to Shasta
 	
 	
 		no Patterson's down by Modesto
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		it's like twenty minutes away from i used to live in Oakland
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		uh and um
 		used to go camping all the time up there but i've lived down here in Patterson now since eighty eight
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		there are a lot of uh camping grounds county and state facilities in the Santa Cruz mountains south of here so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		tends to be a good place for us to get away sometimes
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you have little kids that like to
 	
 	
 		we have one two year old so actually we'd been camping for a long time before she was born  and just now introducing her to her it to her rather
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		um-hum um-hum
 		it's fun for kids though isn't it
 	
 	
 		yeah they really enjoy it i think that she's at an age now you're not as concerned about where she's going to run off to she can pretty much stay close and
 	
 	
 		you know
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i think her first camping trip she was eight months old so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		hopefully she'll learn to enjoy it as much as we do
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i'm ready to go camping again i i did go camping in a in a camper on a pickup deer hunting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh over a weekend so know lived in a camper on that
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's that's kind of fun we did that once in Yosemite too
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's not too bad at least you're inside you don't have to worry about the bears and
 	
 	
 		right that was one good reason in Yosemite the person in the camper next to us had gotten hit by the bears that night so we were glad we were a little more secure
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum but
 	
 	
 		yes in fact i've never been camping at all in Yosemite outside of the uh the camper arrangement i know that they have tent cabins
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that sort of remind me of the environmental cabin situation but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it it it would be fun to go camping up there again i haven't been up to Yosemite for God i don't know how many years i would love to go up there again
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a beautiful place i think i worry that it's changing so much so quickly the valley has become so popular
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i know if they say the road up there is terrible now you know with all the traffic
 	
 	
 		do you remember it a a long time ago i don't know if you ever went there like back in the fifties or
 	
 	
 		it was a long time ago that i went there but i've only been there once
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		my folks used to tell me about trips that we took when we were little um and that at that time there really weren't delegated designated campsites so um
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		people would basically come as soon as they could to stakeout their their terrain and
 		put themselves basically anywhere they could find a spot so you go to bed at night and have a few people around you and wake up in the morning and just be surrounded  there were no limitations in other words to the campsite there were people everywhere
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah yeah but it's beautiful though you look outside in the dark and you see all the stars all the stars up there and everything compared to uh you know living in the city
 	
 	
 		it's a little bit better arrangement today
 		um-hum um-hum
