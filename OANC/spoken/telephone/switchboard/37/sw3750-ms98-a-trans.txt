 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay so you enjoy camping
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i uh like like you i haven't done it in quite some time
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		except for what i call living now  which is which is very close to camping  yeah you know i i camped in the Boy Scouts and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		is it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know my dad and i went out sometimes but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working i camped almost all the time because i was in construction
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress i mean you when you have to have it you got to have it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know in uh in those those kinds of situations uh you know room rent was just outrageous
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so my buddy and i we just camped  and we figured what the hell we did it when we were kids and we loved it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		course we didn't really rough it that much when when i was in in high school uh he's a couple of years older than me and uh
 		he graduated and went off to college and and during during summer we'd camp out at the lake
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it was wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove and you know i had a little uh boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine
 	
 	
 		oh well yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh well it was fantastic we'd get up in the morning go skiing
 		at that substituted for a shower you know and then we'd go to work and uh come back to the you know to the boat house at night
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know in in the afternoon you know it's still four o'clock you got four hours of day light good skiing left
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it was great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh you know now my life is more like camping than not camping really
 	
 	
 		um-hum do you have electricity out there yeah you've got a phone obviously
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago we didn't have a phone
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they didn't have phone lines i mean there was you just couldn't get a phone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we're on the we're third from the end on the electric string
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh and we're at the end of the mail route  like i said we are probably as far as you can get from a Seven Eleven and still be in Texas
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i guess so huh
 	
 	
 		but uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and i is we got a a mobile home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		one of these twelve by forty eight's that got repaid
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i swapped them a Cadillac for it and i put it out here on the land figuring i'd build a house some day you know i'm in construction and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know i just had this place you know to shower up while i was you know out here you know putting up fence and building driveway and drilling well and all that stuff that you have to do before you can even put a house in you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i came home from work one Friday afternoon and our truck was packed  everything we had was in boxes and my wife said uh we're moving
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i said where she said out to the trailer and i said oh no she said yep i said okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so we've been uh roughing it out here about three years but it's not bad i we got color TV and microwave i mean you know it's not horrible but it's it's a lot like camping
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well i grew up in California in southern uh central California right in the valley so it's forty five minute drive to the mountains and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um so my dad loved fishing and camping so we'd go up first we went up just uh with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our um hot dogs by the fire or whatever
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but then later my mom and dad got a camper so uh we've kind of moved up yeah a little bit in the world
 	
 	
 		became civilized
 		
 
 		yep my mom goes camping you know she she takes her uh motor home
 		you know she's got one of these huge Winnebago's with a refrigerator and air conditioning color TV microwave oven you know she just roughing it for me is you know going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and but you know she has a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and mostly it's just a way to she she goes to dog shows see she shows dogs and uh you can sneak a dog into a motel but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		no
 	
 	
 		and so she you know takes the motor home
 		and she made a deal with my dad that she'd take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing and she but if he'd buy her a motor home so he did
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but as far as as camping my wife and i had plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the you know Highway One there in in California
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh as soon as we get this house finished i'm gonna need a vacation
 	
 	
 		yeah oh that's a that'll be pretty that's really pretty out there
 		so a lot of nice places
