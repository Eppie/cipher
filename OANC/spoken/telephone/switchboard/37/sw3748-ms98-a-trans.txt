 		yeah i uh i basically agree uh i have
 		mixed feelings i guess there are some uh
 		somehow there needs to be some controls on the rising costs of of health care
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i myself uh
 		i haven't worked for three years because of some medical problems and uh if i had not had insurance
 		with the company i worked with at the time i believe i would have died and that worries me thinking cause i know a lot of people that don't have any coverage at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah if you if you don't have a very good paying job or you are not with a company that provides it it is uh pretty much unaffordable uh to pay for it on your own
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i i think that paying for it on your own it is like in my case i am up to about two hundred thousand dollars worth of health care i don't think that would have been possible for  the majority of the people in this world
 	
 	
 		yeah that is right
 	
 	
 		so but then again there is uh the high cost of medical care is out unreal
 	
 	
 		yeah i have a friend who uh uh is from uh lived at lived in London or lived in London and he lives here now where they do have medical uh health care uh there and i guess
 		i guess there is some disadvantages too i guess uh uh because of that they there has been a great uh
 		migration of of doctors from there over to more lucrative practices and sometimes i guess it does effect the quality of health care somewhat so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i think somewhere along the line whatever plan they come up with it is going to have to keep the doctors in a high paying field
 	
 	
 		i
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i myself have a son who hopes to be a doctor in a couple three more years and uh  he is doing it for the money
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah they don't have i think they don't get into it for any other reason
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but he agrees with me though that there should be something worked out for the people that can't afford it
 	
 	
 		yes uh i uh agree too and also the uh the elderly a lot of times when they uh reach retirement uh
 		they can't afford any any supplemental insurance beyond what is provided through Medicare and Medicaid and sometimes that is not enough to to cover the costs
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		i found out yeah i uh my mother is on Medicare Medicaid whatever and uh i know it doesn't pay all of her medical hospital bills and so forth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i think it is kind of a shame that at this point in her life she still has to pay quite a bit whenever she is in the hospital several thousand for a weeks stay if she ends up having to pay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah particularly for people who are on uh on on just living mostly on social security or something like that they don't have enough extra money to pay for that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i know one uh not this Christmas but the Christmas before she was out here and we were out at Smithville which is a little town out east of here and
 		we had to take her to the hospital on a Sunday afternoon for a back problem uh fairly minor she just strained it sprained it but
 		when the bills starting coming in she had already gone home so i got a chance to look at them and i was shocked i mean i have been through a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean with medical bills but when i saw what they did to her that day and it cost about three thousand dollars just to uh get a prescription for some pain pills basically
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh in i guess in addition to uh uh national health care policy there uh there has to be some sort of
 		monitoring i guess too of the overall medical field and hospital costs and and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		well that doesn't happen i
 		it is weird i was in the hospital for like eight days back in October uh so many mistakes were made during my time there that i uh literally left the hospital in a taxi cab
 		just to get away from the place i was scared as to what they were going to do to me next
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and when i got the bill it was outrageous uh pills that i had never heard of that i had taken which i know that i didn't i mean i wasn't ill i was just in for some routine stuff and  it goes on and on
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i am afraid right now there is a lot of i guess you would have to call it just basic fraud in the in in the business cause they know they can turn a lot of these things in and they are not questioned at all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know which one of the uh democratic candidates either either Kerrey or Clinton i guess one of those two i can't remember which is pretty much in favor of some sort of
 	
 	
 		i think Kerrey is and i think also Jerry Brown from California are interested uh actually the way Bush has been going the last few weeks i think he may be interested uh  he he seem to be
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well he's he's probably campaigning i don't know how serious he is but
 	
 	
 		yeah  uh
 		yeah up until just recently i i would have thought Bush would uh you know i still he has done a pretty good job
