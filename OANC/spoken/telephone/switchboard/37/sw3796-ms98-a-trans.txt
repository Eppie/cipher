 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		uh did you watch the Bulls this morning
 	
 	
 		you know what i watched a little bit of uh of the Bulls game and i uh had to leave um in fact i i think the Bulls were ahead when i uh when i left who won the game
 	
 	
 		they won in a squeaker they won by they won by two points uh they were behind as they headed into each quarter and then they came back  in the second half and at the end i think they were
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		uh looked they looked like they were closing it out and then Detroit kept coming back and uh Isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end and uh i think the Bulls won by two
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		wow they've got the don't they have the best record now
 	
 	
 		i think they do as a matter of fact one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace  uh set an NBA record for seventy wins in a season
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		wow
 	
 	
 		yeah they looked real good and
 	
 	
 		they they do and they uh you know  i think by uh by relieving some of the pressure off of uh
 		of uh  uh Michael Jordan really helped them out you know he doesn't have they don't have to rely on him to score every you know thirty or forty points at every at every game so
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah well they they're they're balancing their attack and i think they look like uh
 		they'll repeat although uh here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson's done with the Warriors
 	
 	
 		oh i know i'm yeah i saw the Warriors  i saw the Warriors uh  just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors uh Dallas game
 	
 	
 		i saw the the second half of the game last night and they were impressive
 	
 	
 		they look good
 	
 	
 		Billy Owens looks like he was that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him
 	
 	
 		yeah now i don't uh i haven't kept up with what was going on with uh with the Warriors
 	
 	
 		well they traded away uh
 		Mitch Richmond or is it Tim Hardaway one of the two
 		uh who along with uh Chris Mullin was you know though three were three of the best in the NBA and and they made a heck of a threesome and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		good move
 	
 	
 		yeah oh yeah he's really worked out well they've got the the Warriors have got a team uh and uh
 		i think that'll be real interesting to see what they can do they're ahead and the Lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west and i don't know in the east i don't know uh is it Boston in uh first place
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh i think Boston's in first um
 		i you know i haven't kept up with any of the other uh teams uh i'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks you know
 	
 	
 		boy they've had a hard time they said they've lost a lot of squeakers
 	
 	
 		oh man that well yeah but i mean just this whole year has been just disastrous for them and uh
 		you know they're going i i think they're going for an all time record of how many losses you know losses in a row they can they can they can uh pull out  it's unbelievable
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		how do people in Texas deal with Dallas Houston and San Antonio do you for example like San Antonio uh in Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh  actually actually the the the Dallas area here uh pulls for Dallas uh San Antonio pulls for San Antonio and Houston pulls for for the Rockets
 	
 	
 		so there isn't much crossover huh you
 	
 	
 		they're really i mean not a whole lot you know i mean  you find them they're  find them be to be pretty loyal uh you know with with the local teams
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um you know it's kind of i guess it's kind of like uh there in the Bay area you know you don't find a whole lot of uh  uh of Sacramento fans
 	
 	
 		yeah it's true because San San Antonio isn't that close to you are they
 	
 	
 		really isn't huh-uh it's you know it's it's about the same uh  same distance from here to San to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento  so it's yeah it's not really a local you know
 	
 	
 		no
 		is it
 		yeah so it's not something you'd drive
 		yeah i was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		um he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio and they i mean they have got a great club  you know
 	
 	
 		they've done a good job i mean of course drafting a franchise like him certainly
 	
 	
 		uh yeah yeah that always makes a big difference so
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean that's i think the way it uh i think that's the way it works now in basketball you you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and you know uh Bird for the for the uh Celtics and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and you know uh you know i used to think that that one one player really doesn't make the club
 		but it really does you know you get somebody like Magic and you can see the decline of that team
 	
 	
 		well it it's Steve
 		well yeah i
 	
 	
 		once he left you know i mean it's it's just not the same uh it's not the same team there's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for
 	
 	
 		well i think you're right and i think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit and i think those things do make a difference and there are  marquee players and i think i think Jordan and the and the Bulls have to be
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh considered the likely favorites i don't know who would meet them in the west um i don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year they were so disappointing
 	
 	
 		who won that Portland game
 	
 	
 		you know i wasn't i i didn't i watched only a few minutes of it and i wasn't paying attention uh  so i don't know uh but Phoenix you know Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs and
 	
 	
 		uh
