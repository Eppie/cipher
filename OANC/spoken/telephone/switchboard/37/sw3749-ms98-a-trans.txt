 
     		
 	
 		have you gone to college yourself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i have
 	
 	
 		did you where'd you go
 	
 	
 		i went to Western State College in Gunnison Colorado
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		what about you
 	
 	
 		uh i went i graduated from ah Weaver State University here at in Ogden
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		yeah so what did you uh or what would you recommend for a good college i guess
 	
 	
 		i personally would recommend the smaller college just because
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know you get a lot more
 		individual attention and and you can go speak talk to your professor and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it's just
 		more i think it's more conducive to studying especially if you're like a freshman
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree with you a hundred percent i Weaver's a pretty small college we have uh about ten thousand to twelve thousand students and
 		i i have some friends who went to Brigham Young University and the the University of Utah that you know they got twenty five thirty thousand people and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know all they are is a number you go to a testing center for everything and you just check in by number or you most all most of the time they said they actually even had uh
 		uh student or not student teacher but you know graduate students teaching their classes
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		whereas you know all my professors i knew they were PhD's or whatever and that they were tenured and everything and felt like uh like like you say i got a lot more personal attention and
 	
 	
 		right is that uh is that in the mountains
 	
 	
 		uh yeah we are
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that's the way that's what Western State was too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's beautiful i i'd
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i wouldn't trade it i wish i could move back
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm tired of the big city that's for sure yeah
 	
 	
 		are you
 		are you close to Dallas or
 	
 	
 		yeah we're just uh uh out skirts of Dallas
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah uh we uh in fact my campus was right on uh the benches of the mountains
 		so i was it was really pretty all the time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sure enjoy i i don't know if i could ever move away
 	
 	
 		did you ski
 	
 	
 		of course yeah you i i haven't uh actually the last couple of years i haven't been able to as much because
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh out of school but uh
 		i i did a lot when i was in high school and stuff when i didn't have to spend the time studying and working and supporting a family but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i love it you yourself
 	
 	
 		oh yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		yeah you don't get as much of a chance down there in Texas do you  i would think
 	
 	
 		no
 		
 
 		i regret it too i i really wanna
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'd like to go this year
 		we were supposed to go on a ski trip but that's one that's one thing i would recommend too because you know
 	
 	
 		go up to Colorado or
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		most college you go to a college and you make what you what you uh what you can out of it you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when you get out then you know you're you basically promote yourself and you try and network into a company or or get a job or start a business or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh you just can't trade the
 		the the time you know that you spend in the mountains you know if you if you fish and hunt or whatever and ski
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you know i i'd never give up that
 	
 	
 		oh yeah they offer i mean anymore they offer cook there's a you know we have uh we had a mountain climbing class we had you know we had a ski class
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and there was all kind of that stuff that was offered as you know electives and those were i mean those were the funniest ones i mean
 	
 	
 		right
 		sure
 	
 	
 		that made up for all the English classes or you know the science classes you had to take but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah that was what made it like i say made it worthwhile and
 		at least kept you going to school on a semi regular basis i know it was pretty tough come spring or in summer or especially when it was so cold man if you didn't have a reason like a ski class you never went
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it just wasn't worth it so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but yeah i uh
 		i'm convinced that after getting me my undergraduate degree i would like to go to a big name school to get my graduate degree but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they're so expensive i'm not anymore i i almost think people just require they require a graduate degree or an undergraduate degree they don't necessarily care where from and if you wanna set yourself apart you have to go get that big graduate degree from Harvard or some place like that
 	
 	
 		yeah they do
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		or else it you know you're just Joe Blow off the street nobody knows but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		what'd you get your degree in
 	
 	
 		uh business administration
 	
 	
 		oh did you did you have an emphasis in anything or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		emphasis in finance
 	
 	
 		oh did you that's what i got mine in was in finance yeah so where you're working at now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 		i'm at uh company by the name of E Systems we're a defense contractor down here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's it's pretty good company so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really are you  an analyst for them or
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm a scheduling analyst yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really great
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm a little out of my field of what i wanna be i'm an  auditor for a credit union but
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		it's not something i wanna do for very long
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		is there a lot of
 	
 	
 		we're kind of the bad guys it's kind of a negative type thing but
 	
 	
 		a lot of companies up there or
 	
 	
 		uh not not a lot of private
 		ah there i mean there's a lot of companies but they're not really large enough they're mainly there's a lot of family type companies and just small ten fifteen people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we uh  pretty much are
 		you know the government plays a big part in our economy and
 	
 	
 		for what reason how do they do that
 	
 	
 		well we got we have uh
