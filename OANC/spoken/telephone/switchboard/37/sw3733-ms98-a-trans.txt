 		i thought that's what they said um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh no they they uh they they suggested a variety of possibilities and of whatever hobbies hobbies you can come up with uh no uh
 	
 	
 		oh i see um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		my hobbies kind of vary from time to time depending on what kind of time i've got uh i spent twenty years as an auto mechanic
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		and i enjoy working with with cars uh i've built a couple of race cars uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		oh you have
 	
 	
 		uh yeah um
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		also i do enjoy woodworking uh
 		uh cabinet cabinetry type woodworking
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		i've done some model building and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		different things like that um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		right now hobbies pretty much tend to be on hold
 		with a twelve week old baby and
 	
 	
 		oh my uh-huh
 	
 	
 		full time student hobbies are a extreme luxury
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you say you say you uh sing with a group in a community college
 	
 	
 		uh yes um
 	
 	
 		what sort of music do you work with
 	
 	
 		well we we work with show music and with uh opera arias and actually we're very fortunate to have a um
 		former opera singer uh from New York who is relocated to
 		Dallas and uh she has taken over the the vocal music department at one of the community colleges here in Dallas and uh she both gives private lessons and has um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a variety of classes especially on Saturdays for um people that are interested and what i found i've been going over there for about three or four years now
 		and what we found is that there winds up being a core group of us that um keep on coming back
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and uh we give performances at the college and at the uh Botanical Gardens in the spring time and at various retirement homes and things of that nature
 	
 	
 		that sounds like a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		and you can um select whatever things you want to work on for the semester and she'll help you with them and give you um lots of good points and uh it it's a very
 		enjoyable group uh it's not um overly formal that you have to worry it's not professional but it's good and i enjoy it very much
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		those are usually the best sorts
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i you you say show music like Broadway musical type show music
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh i've i've personally done some things from Camelot and from My Fair Lady you know things like that um
 	
 	
 		okay
 		hum
 		those are wonderful shows
 	
 	
 		uh and uh some of the people really are just very
 		fine singers we kind of enjoy one another
 		so uh and and when we go out to those retirement homes or the nursing homes
 		the people are very very appreciative which also makes you very happy that you're able to kind of pick up somebody else's life also so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 		yeah well the the chances are these are all all things they're very familiar with and just the chance to have some entertainment and some some variety in their life
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 		yes
 	
 	
 		at at retirement homes i mean even still there are variety there there're a lot of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		retirement homes that try to make it sound like it's a real you know luxury condominium setup but still the you know the bulk of the people living there tend to be living pretty restricted lives
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so something like that can be a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i really uh that's really what we have found and also um a lot of the people are very knowledgeable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh in in the field of music they're just very knowledgeable about a lot of things and they'll come and talk to you afterwards and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you better know your onions  but uh it it is something i do enjoy very much so and the other thing i like to do is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		uh cook i have um uh
 		uh planned uh menus for various organizations and this year i was asked to take care of uh several luncheons and dinners up at my children's school
 		and the next thing that we're getting ready for is a big faculty luncheon and we're gonna give them Italian food
 	
 	
 		oh that sounds
