 
     		
 	
 		okay have you painted something lately
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
  
 		yes i have that room i showed you and then since then we painted the bedroom
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah another bedroom
 	
 	
 		yeah i showed you that one too didn't i the brown one yeah the one that looks like a fudgesicle
 	
 	
 		hm yeah yeah yeah
 		oh yeah  oh heavens well i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom but i get i have that trouble with the the ceiling you know the uh what is that blow the blow ceiling
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know where you get around the edge
 	
 	
 		well i've heard now i asked Janice somebody recently about how how you do that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh uh when you paint the ceiling if you know when you got that textured stuff that they'd have special rollers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that are real soft and furry that you'd paint that with how you get the edge you just have to be real careful
 	
 	
 		well how do you get the edge though the the straight edge oh i see
 	
 	
 		we use a a two inch brush with uh on a slant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too
 	
 	
 		well yeah i think i'm going to do it this spring actually
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		there're there're six houses see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that we do as far as the the materials there's three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses
 	
 	
 		oh oh nice
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i'm thinking i'm gonna change it to something you know the brick is multicolor with mostly earth tones i think i'm gonna put something like a brown on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that'd be nice
 	
 	
 		on the outside yeah and maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something something where it'll stand out a little
 	
 	
 		hm or two tone or two tone
 	
 	
 		what color'd you paint
 		what yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		there's some columns that could be painted a different color too what color did you paint your house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well the white but i have a problem i can't get up high and we can't paint the chimney
 	
 	
 		on the outside
 		well you got to get one of those ladders
 	
 	
 		well we have one of those ladders we're just not willing to get up that high
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well  a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he's done his house and that's what he i was out there last weekend he's finished everything except the chimney
 	
 	
 		well we did too we did it in the fall  and it's just it's too high it's really scary but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the only thing i would consider doing a professional is maybe doing that but is other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i know our house in New Mexico it was stucco but we had all this trim to paint and a lots of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and we did basically seventy five percent of the house and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i hired this man to come in and do it young kid and he came with with his own rafter uh what do you call those things no those where you built like a rafter thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		the blowers
 		oh oh oh oh i know what you're talking about um scaffolds that's it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		scaffolds yeah he came and did it that way and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and literally i wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactuses and if he fell he was dead and he knew that  so
 	
 	
 		it's
 		yeah
 		oh my  so that was worth it getting a professional for that
 	
 	
 		yeah plus he cleaned up my mess
 	
 	
 		oh i think that's what we might have to do with the chimney but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it wasn't too bad i mean you save
 	
 	
 		how much did it cost you to for the paint for the outside
 	
 	
 		shoot maybe a hundred and fifty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know since it's a one story but we did uh like two heavy coats over it but in in in that way you know you're assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah that
 		yeah
 		that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to  oh Furrows i guess to buy his paint and yet he bought like seventeen gallons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		my word
 	
 	
 		and anyway he when he checked out they only and and he was using his Furrows charge card too they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh my word
 	
 	
 		and he had he had the bill he had already carried a ladder outside and and told her that and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so she had to start all over again and he when he got outside he noticed his receipt was for like thirteen ninety nine or something
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh my word so that was really worth it painting his own house
 	
 	
 		and he saw it i guess yeah it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff
 	
 	
 		oh my word oh my word well he really saved in that way  but yeah i think we're gonna to do uh another bathroom
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but uh i think i'll probably just do it in a roller i wanna do it about the same color and just be a little
 	
 	
 		yeah rollers are so messy we never mess with them anymore
 	
 	
 		oh i know but it's that it's the textured wall
 	
 	
 		well still a paintbrush
 	
 	
 		he can still
