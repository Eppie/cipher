 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh what is the last home repair that you did
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i'm trying to think well i guess ours have mostly been down at our lake house we built a house built a house down on Cedar Creek Lake
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 		i guess i'd have to say that because we've kind of let this house go
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so we had a shell built and then we did everything else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it was quite a bit of work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what have you done
 	
 	
 		well uh repaired the back fence it's uh well of course they get old you know after about ten years anyway but uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah ours is nineteen years old
 	
 	
 		yeah the the street the alley's on a kind of a slant
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it makes all the fences tilt or or slowly you know
 	
 	
 		oh do you have to have like a retaining wall or
 	
 	
 		yeah somewhat right
 	
 	
 		yeah that makes them more difficult we we've just my husband has just um repaired repaired ours a lot it really needs to be replaced but we haven't done it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		anyway well have you done anything else
 	
 	
 		um had to replace the the ridge row the shingles on the corners of the the roof from all the storms and everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i you know i'm wondering myself now why i checked this one because my husband is who does all the things like what you're talking about
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		i haven't
 		done those things and of course
 		you know inside stuff
 		but um
 		now down at the lake we had to like put in floors and put in
 		wall and you know do the painting and the
 		uh cut and make the like the
 		uh window sills and
 		things around the door and all that kind of stuff you know so we we did quite a bit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh down there that i had never done or we haven't done that much in our own house
 	
 	
 		weather proofing and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah uh we do have still have a problem down there we built us a two story house and the bottom story uh oh it's more like walk out basement
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when it was built with these blocks you know these old gray blocks i think they're called Hadite blocks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we found now with some as much rain as we've had the past year it seeps through
 		those blocks and comes into the downstairs
 		and uh so now we have bought some uh
 	
 	
 		what's uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		water proofing paint
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's our next project the next time we go down there we've got to paint all those block walls downstairs with this waterproof paint and then hope that maybe that will do it
 		but what they should've done i think is they should have put plastic or something like that against the house before they put the dirt back you know when it was built
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh they didn't do that didn't think they'd need to
 	
 	
 		and then that it's that it's that white paint i've forgotten what it's called Tight Bond or something like that and those bricks are very porous
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it soaks in to those bricks really well and it seals all the water out
 	
 	
 		oh have you ever used that anywhere
 	
 	
 		just a little bit
 	
 	
 		now people up north that have basements i think
 	
 	
 		yeah they use it all the time
 	
 	
 		you and do you know if it if they've had good luck with it
 	
 	
 		yeah it seals the water out
 	
 	
 		we had a hard time even finding it down here in fact you know you go in a store and they say oh well that we don't have anything like that you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then finally found some one somewhere that was familiar with it probably lived in the North
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and well that's encouraging then because i haven't known that many you know there's just not many basements down here are you from around here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah i'm from Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh okay well we're from you know Texas too so
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but i we have a partner in this deal and he's from the North so he was the one that and it gave us a lot more space you know it gave us double the space
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and toward the lake it looks like a two story house you know because it gradually the back it looks like a one story house you know
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 		yeah and it's set into the earth so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh built kind of into a hill a little hill you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so it was a good idea to give us a lot more space for the money
 	
 	
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we just uh hadn't solved our  water problem yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but we always
