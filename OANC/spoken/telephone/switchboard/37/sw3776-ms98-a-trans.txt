 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i uh spent four years as a university professor and yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really i i've spent three years um teaching in public schools and elementary school
 	
 	
 		oh do you really that's great
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i taught in Utah and uh
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		did you teach in California
 	
 	
 		what
 		i did i did um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you sound pretty young for a university professor
 	
 	
 		well i was pretty young well i was uh i had never intended to do it and i was uh
 		uh given the opportunity after i'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in uh uh one of the business schools in the California State University system
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		at any rate um the topic is fascinating because one of the things i've done for the past few years is um
 		research the problem from the point of view of uh uh what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically you may be familiar with cooperative learning
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		have you ever
 	
 	
 		well you can you can tell me a little bit more about it because i don't think we did that in Utah
 	
 	
 		well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools and uh what what it involves basically
 		is the use of peer groups and the uh teacher becomes a uh a sort of a consultant resource person
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives i guess they're called and there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh
 		gain a competence with respect to the material
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i think that the combination of uh technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution
 		in the way we learn uh i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system
 		uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster uh school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh both teachers and parents uh complain about the uh uh the cost and ineffectiveness that results so my feeling is that um
 	
 	
 		true
 	
 	
 		the the problem is is
 		uh significant there are plenty of good people uh available to
 		um offer people educational experience but that we just have to reallocate reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it and uh i think
 		certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research um
 		uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and my feeling is that uh those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually i don't know what form it'll ultimately take
 		um
 		uh but i think that
 		the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for
 		uh inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior so it must be the way we're managing the process that
 		uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i see what you're saying yeah i totally agree
 	
 	
 		i i don't
 		i don't think it's it's a matter of of uh talented people to do it as both as quote unquote students and as teachers
 		but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		in the past thirty years that weren't existent uh you must see kids with real significant problems um in some cases
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh course Iowa City i don't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in Iowa City is it is it uh deteriorated a lot do the people say or are they pretty happy with it or
 	
 	
 		well i've i haven't taught in Iowa but i've taught in Utah and um
 		people there were saying that
 		the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to home where they taught their kids at home
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		or you know anything but the public schools and the ones that did have you know the kids yeah well
 	
 	
 		even in Utah
 		well Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe
 	
 	
 		well uh maybe it was the area i was in but a lot of schools had lot of transient um families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side and
 	
 	
 		yeah you see you saw a fair number of troubled kids
 	
 	
 		yeah and i mean like you said how they were the schools were doing more things for the kids
 		they thought than they were thirty years ago i mean they were the school i was teaching at the the year i left they're considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		as well as hot lunch and
