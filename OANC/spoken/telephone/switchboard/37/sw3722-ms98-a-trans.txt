 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh
 	
 	
 		do you know you know what the topic is
 	
 	
 		music
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		what type do you like
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i like uh pretty much rock popular rock
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		what kind do you like
 	
 	
 		uh i like rock semi classical soft jazz not heavy rock
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um i can get into soft jazz too
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't like uh country particularly or rap or um what else
 	
 	
 		no
 		
 
 		country turns me off uh the my my girlfriend likes rap
 		i don't like
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely strange but uh i i never got much i mean every so often there is like a song out that just sounds funny when you listen to it and those are probably the only kind i like but uh rap in general like i don't get into
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so who's your favorite artist right now
 	
 	
 		um i i actually have a couple of favorite artists i i like guys like you know Billy Joel uh who are singers song writers you know i mean who are
 	
 	
 		great he's one of my favorites
 	
 	
 		yeah he's i i love him i i had his greatest hits uh and i had to have it on i have it on tape i have it on CD and i have it on record
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		
 
 		my tape went bad so i bought a record then my record went bad so i bought a CD
 	
 	
 		what is your very favorite song that Billy Joel has done
 	
 	
 		
 
 		probably Piano Man
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh maybe maybe just because it is like on i think it is the first one on the on the CD
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's the first one on the tape too and i just listen to it a lot and i just i just love it
 	
 	
 		my very favorite is still rock and roll to me
 	
 	
 		hm that is a good one
 		you ever see the video uh by Billy Joel uh it's not  it's uh another one about uh he is in a courtroom and he has you something like Keeping the Faith that's the name of the song and in the video he uh he's actually in court
 	
 	
 		yes i think so
 	
 	
 		and  and uh Christi Brinkley's in it yeah that's another reason i like him he's like married to the girl i love you know
 	
 	
 		well then he has another video that she's been in uh he's like uh uh i think it is Uptown Girl and that's the first one that i had seen her in she is just so gorgeous
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right right
 		um-hum
 		i know i know no uh the the Keeping the Faith is great because uh you see you know all these people in the courtroom and they have these girls dancing  on the railings on the sides
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i just got a kick out of it it was just really funny
 	
 	
 		well the other one that he came out with and i loved the video for it too uh it was i think on his last CD uh
 		We Didn't Start the Fire
 	
 	
 		uh um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah he
 	
 	
 		oh i just love that song
 	
 	
 		he he just has the ability i mean every so often he'll just come out with uh you know a couple of the songs that are just great yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum does he have anything new out do you know
 	
 	
 		no i haven't heard anything lately um but then again i haven't bought any CDs lately i had a CD player and i just moved from Washington about two years ago and uh when i was in Washington in DC i i gave my CD player to my sister because i was going to buy another one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and you never bought another one
 	
 	
 		and and well i have one now but i just got it it's like two months ago so i i just uh recently have started going back into the CD market
 	
 	
 		yes
 		did you get one that loads more than one or did you get a single
 	
 	
 		yeah i got the the five disc carousel
 	
 	
 		that's what we have and i'll tell you it's a lot nicer because you can you know sometimes i get tired of listening to the same artist over you know for the whole entire length of the CD and it's nice when you can randomly choose them too
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum um-hum
 		oh yeah
 		yeah i that's what i really like and i bought a little single disc for my car
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh that's great i mean i every since i put that thing in my car i haven't heard a tape since
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd like to have one of those next car i buy i don't know how expensive they are when you are putting them in
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		well i just i just got a little portable one and i bought a little they Sony makes a base unit that you can just mount in your car and so the whole package was under two hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh that's great
 	
 	
 		yeah otherwise i mean if you buy them in a car now it's like five hundred bucks for a whole unit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		ooh that might be a little bit more than my budget
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's that's a little extravagant you know but if you can afford the cars that it can come into you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's not that bad
 		but
 	
 	
 		do you go to any concerts or anything
 	
 	
 		i haven't been to any uh since i've been out of college um and it usually the concerts that have come up lately i have been out of town uh traveling so i just haven't had the chance to go to any
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and i work with a bunch of young people in the office they're always going to concerts but whenever they tell me there's one coming up there's something going on and i can never go
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so i know i haven't been to any i've been missing out on life
 	
 	
 		well there is someone that i just discovered like in the last couple of years and have you ever heard of Yanni
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		of who
 	
 	
 		Yanni
 	
 	
 		uh name the name sounds familiar
 	
 	
 		he's a composer he's dating Linda Evans right now and he does i first heard when uh i first moved to Dallas about five years ago there was uh a station that played soft rock and light jazz
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i did not think i liked jazz at all until i started listening to this station and Yanni is one of these i guess he's kind of new wavish or something
 	
 	
 		hum
 		i think that's where i saw Yanni was there was something about him dating Linda Evans
 	
 	
 		that 's probably right exactly but his music is absolutely wonderful and i've kind of gotten into a little bit of this new age or new wave or whatever it may be and uh there's a lot of that that i like a
 	
 	
 		is it really hum
 		um-hum
 		hum
