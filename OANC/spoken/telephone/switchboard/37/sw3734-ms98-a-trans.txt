 		so it really varies i try to dress very comfortably i don't really like dressing up at all
 	
 	
 		oh me neither
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that i just i don't know it just it takes too much time out of my day and i don't i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah same here i don't mind not wearing any makeup
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't mind it at all
 		i
 	
 	
 		um i work at a bakery  because i'm a still a a college student um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		okay
 	
 	
 		but we we have to wear white pants and um
 		any color T shirt as long as it's not like a bright color like a pastel
 	
 	
 		white pants in a bakery
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah the bakers wear all white  and we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back and so
 	
 	
 		wow
 		
 
 		okay
 		what's the name of the bakery
 	
 	
 		Cullentini's
 	
 	
 		oh Italian i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah  it's Italian bakery and uh so
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		i don't mind having having to wear a uniform because i don't have to buy you know
 	
 	
 		new clothes and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah isn't that yeah many clothes
 	
 	
 		yeah that's one thing i would like is just to sort of have i'd i really don't like uniforms
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		but just to
 		have something where i don't have to get up and decide what to wear because that just bugs me to death
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know i do that every day for school
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but i i like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things
 	
 	
 		and sweats and things yeah when i was in school i was sweat monster i mean that's all i had was sweats and when it time to go out i didn't have anything to wear
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yeah i know i don't have very many dress clothes but i don't mind i don't need them yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		hum
 		i hate shoes
 		if i didn't have to have shoes i wouldn't have them
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		i just i don't know my feet bother me and
 		they're just tedious to go find shoes for me it's just i don't know i wear a size nine
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it i don't know it's just the shoes i get i really either don't like them or they don't fit right and i just wish that i could just go without them
 	
 	
 		hum
 		oh wow i love shoes i always buy shoes  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really oh
 		just the opposite
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um
 		let's see what else do i wear
 		um if i were in a bigger market when i do get into a bigger market i'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things and
 		uh where i wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things and i could then i would be able to dress
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		more business like and things like that but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		we're all kind of just out of school at this station and so we're all you know
 		still in sweats really so it's pretty fun though
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i like the look the the like suit look professional like you know look but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i really don't have much of a opportunity to wear it
 	
 	
 		yeah i like
 	
 	
 		um i'm gonna be a teacher so i'll probably just wear uh casual clothes maybe skirts and some
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		i like this the uh suits with the they come like with a mini type skirt
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and the jacket i like that but
 	
 	
 		yeah that is cute
 	
 	
 		but i'm pretty short i'm five four and so that really doesn't flatter me but i think it looks good on taller people
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm five three and
 	
 	
 		are you  yeah anytime i go to the store i mean i i have like two pairs of pants because i can never find any that are short enough for me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and it's just oh ridiculous pants too i could do without those pants and shoes
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i like the like stretch pants the cotton ones they're really comfortable with a baggy sweatshirt
 	
 	
 		yeah those are nice those are nice yeah
 		yeah those are nice
 		and
 		tennis shoes my boyfriend's got me these
 		LA Gear
 		they're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and it it's just like a chore to pick up my feet
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		because i'm used to wearing the little white ah white girl tennis shoes the little ones yeah
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i have a pair of those yeah
 	
 	
 		and i'm used to those they're just sort of you know like your feet and you don't feel them when you put these things on it's it's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know like exercise or something for your feet it's like  and i have to wear them because he gets upset if i don't so  so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so how do people in Wisconsin dress
 	
 	
 		warm  this time this time of the year pretty warm sweaters and
 	
 	
 		warm yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah i grew up in New York and so i know what warm is is like five pairs of socks and
