 		hi
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then when i graduated and we got married and everything i really kind of lost interest in following teams have you been following any
 	
 	
 		not too much um who is it from the Mavericks that just wasn't there some controversy about one of their players that didn't get to play so now he doesn't he didn't get to play the whole game so now he doesn't want to play at all or something
 	
 	
 		oh no i know they're always having um i mean i can't believe the amount of money that the players make in the first place and i mean i know that they have a short um career and everything
 	
 	
 		its crazy
 		right but even so i mean i don't think i will make a million in or three million  in a life time let alone a season
 	
 	
 		that's true it's really a lot but uh my sister always gets um season tickets to the Utah Jazz and um
 	
 	
 		yep
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so she watches their games a lot and and everything but i don't believe we've ever been involved with any team that you know makes it to the play-offs
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we came from Oakland i went to BYU also
 	
 	
 		too much
 		uh-huh
 		you did
 	
 	
 		yep any way and see um we use to go to some of the the games there but we really haven't done much with the Mavericks here
 	
 	
 		well i was at uh BYU when they made it to the play-offs and i think they played Notre Dame or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um for the big game i can't remember now that was so seems like it was eons ago it was like ten years ago i think and um i remember
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		did you know let me think who was on that team there was a Dave Callus or a Gordon Breun remember those names
 	
 	
 		um isn't that the one that was like the star player was Danny Ainge i think he started playing for the Boston Boston Celtics after that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		Celtics right right
 	
 	
 		and um  and um and there was another the center
 		it's been so long i can't think of anyone's name but um i i was there that year and enjoyed that game and uh but mostly like i say i haven't been following the teams and don't know who's got what record
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right so do you play for your ward team
 	
 	
 		i haven't played uh since i broke my knee cap  but um i did play in high school i was on our high school girls' team
 	
 	
 		oh oh
 		uh-huh where did you go to high school
 	
 	
 		well i lived in Missouri and i went and i played for Parkview High School in Missouri in Springfield Missouri and i played um a forward
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um i enjoyed that then and that's i always loved sports do you play for your ward
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um i kind of stopped playing for my ward because i didn't like the sportsmanship with the stake
 	
 	
 		the problem that is a problem
 	
 	
 		so i play for a Richardson City league now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but as far as knowing anything about professional teams you know when they said to put
 		put down what you're interested in i i wasn't really thinking about  talking about
 	
 	
 		no well i was thinking about my own personal basketball experiences as opposed to professional because i'd rather play than watch any thing
 	
 	
 		right  right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um so i'm you know like i
 	
 	
 		do you have any players that you like watching
 	
 	
 		well i um i have one i don't like his name his last name was Sampson do you remember him and he because he came to Houston when i lived there and um to play for the Houston team and he was really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i thought a bad sport and uh and i haven't followed like i say
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it really only takes one player to really give any team a bad rap you know one that
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah that's really true but um
 	
 	
 		publicity bound you know that
 	
 	
 		well and i also don't want to spend so much of my time um memorizing statistics
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um keeping you know  being wrapped up in a team and caring whether they win or lose in the sense that it makes a big difference in my life you know because i just don't have that kind of time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's right
 		you know once it gets into the finals then i i kind of root for one or the other but up until then you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's true and and you know i get i have interest in the games but i'm satisfied to watch a score in the newspaper or on you know the sports news report or something
 	
 	
 		yeah the highlights
 	
 	
 		right rather than just like you say watch clips from the game
 	
 	
 		do you have kids that play
 	
 	
 		no i my both my children are little they're just in kindergarten and first grade
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so no they don't play and um
 		and my husband loves baseball which i don't really prefer but
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so we haven't uh haven't don't been into basketball too much but anyway
 	
 	
 		oh did you stay with now what team is it from Houston
 	
 	
 		now i can remember even what they were called um
 	
 	
 		i wanna say Spurs but is that right
 	
 	
 		no i don't think so no it was the Astros the Astros were the baseball team and the Oilers Rockets yes that's it the Rockets
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		Rockets
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i uh you know we saw a game
