 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so what do you think about the uh income taxes
 	
 	
 		well i could do with a lot less than that
 	
 	
 		where do you live
 	
 	
 		i live in Dallas
 	
 	
 		okay i live in Dallas too
 	
 	
 		oh good well i live in Plano in that case
 	
 	
 		okay i live in uh in the Village do you know where that is i
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i do yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in Dallas is the eight and a quarter percent sales tax
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		it i think it's like the highest in the US because my sister lived in New York and it was only seven percent there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Washington DC was only six percent
 		and where i moved from Virginia was only four and a half percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to four and a half
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		it was only four percent
 	
 	
 		and you know we had no sales tax here about oh i don't know maybe ten years ago we had none at all and that's how it started with uh four percent five percent
 	
 	
 		really
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and all of a sudden here we are now
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's horrible
 	
 	
 		what
 		since there's no uh state tax i assume that that's why it went up fast because Virginia does have a state tax
 	
 	
 		well
 		it's true but they did without it all those years
 	
 	
 		um-hum hm
 	
 	
 		and they keep talking about the state tax and they'll probably put one in and they'll have this too so
 	
 	
 		yeah it
 		if they put state tax in i mean i'll be pretty upset
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh every two weeks and uh  if that comes back in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i'll be pretty mad because sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i don't know i'm not very much for a for state tax
 	
 	
 		well i hope it doesn't but you know how it goes so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they're putting up the the racing fees they said they may raise taxes because of that yeah they said uh to build okay
 	
 	
 		raise them
 	
 	
 		apparently they said the builders would provide thirty million dollars in funds
 		and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes
 		but it seems like it would pay itself off
 	
 	
 		oh well it will
 	
 	
 		so you know  what's the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know
 	
 	
 		probably the first season
 	
 	
 		yeah so you know
 	
 	
 		but they're funny about things like that here
 	
 	
 		yeah things like that you know
 	
 	
 		they really are when i came here you couldn't buy beer couldn't buy a drink  nothing was open on Sunday not even a grocery store i mean nothing nothing you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		no huh
 	
 	
 		so it was a lot worse and as more people come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws
 	
 	
 		um-hum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesn't bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh  like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in Virginia they had personal property tax in the counties
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that was a lot my parents paid almost four thousand dollars a year in personal property tax on the house they paid almost a thousand dollars on uh
 	
 	
 		oh that is
 	
 	
 		on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you don't forget about it at the last minute you know and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year
 	
 	
 		that is
 		yeah
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but that gets real expensive
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that is
 	
 	
 		do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all do you know
 	
 	
 		uh uh they well they do a little bit but um
 		it's it's like next to nothing i've seen it it's on my when you pay your registration and stuff like that there is a little place
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 		well you know like every year they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or sixty bucks
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it costs what
 	
 	
 		so it's only like fifty or sixty bucks to renew your registration here but in Virginia they won't renew your registration till you pay your property personal property tax
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i had a i  i paid you know twelve hundred dollars a year for my last car
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess
 	
 	
 		God
 	
 	
 		that's not too bad but other than that everything worked out
 	
 	
 		yeah so you haven't been here very long
 	
 	
 		what's that
 	
 	
 		you haven't been here very long
 	
 	
 		i've been here about two years now
 	
 	
 		two years
 	
 	
 		but uh in the two years i've i've been here i've been through i've had two cars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i've never really like you know
 		i don't know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 	
 	
 		on the car other than what i paid when i registered uh registered the car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that's the only thing i can really think of
 		so so do you work for TI or you just doing this
 	
 	
 		no i don't i'm a nurse i work down at Presbyterian
 	
 	
 		okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought it'd be kind of cool
 	
 	
 		yeah oh it is you know they're supposed to cut you off at ten calls at least that's what i heard that you could could get to do ten calls
 	
 	
 		oh do they really
 		yeah i i don't know how the thing works uh
 	
 	
 		and this is like the seventeenth
 	
 	
 		oh really  all right you
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's great
