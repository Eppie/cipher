 
     		
 	
 		i don't know about you but i haven't had any trouble having any fun on vacation
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i can't think of any place i wouldn't want to go to take one
 	
 	
 		um well where are some of the places you've been
 	
 	
 		oh i know a real good place is Virginia
 		it's real nice
 		it has mountains beach whatever you want
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		have you been in any great places lately
 	
 	
 		well i've been a lot of different places uh
 		Hawaii Japan Europe
 	
 	
 		oh now i haven't been there
 	
 	
 		and and
 		most of the fifty
 		i haven't been to Alaska yet
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 		you plan on going
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought we might go up on the uh inland ferry that goes up there from uh from British
 	
 	
 		oh yeah now i'd like to go uh to Canada on the boat
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		my parents went not long ago
 		or to Key West have you ever been to Key West
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		is it pretty
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's a long desolate stretch but  well desolate in that it's all uh the same scenery after a while just like driving in the desert you know  after a while it all looks the same
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh no
 		no i've never been huh is it very expensive
 	
 	
 		huh
 		no no
 	
 	
 		not compared to Hawaii huh
 	
 	
 		well actually Hawaii is getting cheap too because uh
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		with the economic uh
 		situation uh situation we're in they've lowered the prices uh quite a bit
 	
 	
 		well that's nice to know
 		well that's good
 	
 	
 		where do you stay when you go to Virginia on the beach
 	
 	
 		um yeah i've been to Virginia Beach and i've been up to the uh homestead in hot springs in the mountains it's real nice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh oh let's  see i've been to Charlottesville through Monticello uh my husband's a a landscape architect and he uh he really liked that and to see Thomas Jefferson's home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i bet
 		well if he's a landscape architect he ought to like Washington DC in the daylight hours
 	
 	
 		yeah now we we went there went there to stay at the Army Navy club with my dad and that was real nice that was real nice
 	
 	
 		your dad's in the military
 	
 	
 		uh no he used to be he he's a retired attorney now uh but he was the uh he was uh uh
 	
 	
 		retired retired
 	
 	
 		in the reserves for quite a long time and uh he's active in something right now i forgot what it is
 		that's how close i am no i don't mean that
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but um  i he's somehow connected still with it
 	
 	
 		well being from uh living in Texas you probably like cool weather on your uh vacations at least we do
 	
 	
 		yeah sometimes sometimes you know when it in when it's getting really hot in Texas you know you want to go someplace cool
 	
 	
 		uh
 		yeah
 		well usually vacation time July August September it's time to go somewhere else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		have you ever been to Arkansas
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		now i've i've been but not to way up at near Branson oh i hear it's just booming up there now
 	
 	
 		um
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		up around Silver Silver Silver Dollar City have you been there
 	
 	
 		no no i haven't
 	
 	
 		i heard on uh what was it Sixty Minutes or something a lot of the country western um people are starting to build their nightclubs up there
 	
 	
 		yeah i saw the Sixty Sixty Minutes also last year we went to uh the Oregon coast and and that is really beautiful
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 		really
 	
 	
 		and that is really beautiful and it's also unlike California completely because it's cool enough that you don't have uh the surfers much because they need protective clothing you know
 	
 	
 		how about population is it very uh crowded
 	
 	
 		and and uh there's really uh several nice places to stay along the coast there
 		we stayed at what was called the uh kite capital of the world what was the name of that city place
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		Lincoln City
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it is really nice uh we a very nice place on the beach and very reasonably priced compared to California particularly
 	
 	
 		oh i bet
 		really i bet but but it's not as crowded either
 	
 	
 		so in fact most of the
 		that's right most of the Californians that uh want to stay on the coast apparently the families and so forth they come up to Oregon and Washington coast to stay because it's much uh more economical
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah i'd like to go up around Washington sometime to see
 	
 	
 		yeah we've we've been up that way and well this that trip we also went to uh Vancouver and out to uh Victoria which is very nice
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i think the furthest west i've ever gotten is the Grand Canyon
 	
 	
 		well you got  you haven't been to California either then
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh no
 	
 	
 		well if you go to California don't go to Los Angeles  unless you really want to just see the movie stars set up and so forth
 	
 	
 		oh i won't
 		no no no
 	
 	
 		but uh San Diego and San Francisco are both very nice right
 	
 	
 		really
 		i know my grandparents have been to San Francisco years ago and they said it was real nice
