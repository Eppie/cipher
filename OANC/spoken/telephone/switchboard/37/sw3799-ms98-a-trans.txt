 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well Delphene do you own a P C
 	
 	
 		well yes i do i have a T I P C
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in fact i have two of them  i have i have one that i collected the the uh ports for one at a time
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like first i bought just the uh the central processing unit and the monitor
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		couple years later i bought a printer and then i needed a a hard drive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so uh there was this guy at TI selling a a TI PC for four hundred dollars and it had everything had the works
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and it had the hard drive and everything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i bought that one instead of buying a hard hard drive for mine so now i have that one with the hard drive and mine with no  the the the other one with no hard drive
 	
 	
 		with a hard drive uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and what i thought i'd use them for was just to to do some work out of my house for
 		you know people who needed uh word processing and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		oh okay well that sounds interesting
 	
 	
 		um-hum the
 	
 	
 		my husband and i own a PC and i use mine for like keeping our home finances
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i also i i play several games on it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i also was doing some work for my church doing some word processing on it for my church and that was
 		really interesting being able to do that on the computer they were surprised at how much could be done
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		with a PC
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought i might uh
 		get some extra income somehow or another uh
 	
 	
 		i imagine if you advertise like in the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh the i guess like The Texan's or if there's another paper up there at at your office
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you should be able to get some work that way
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i'll I'll i thought about doing that one time in fact i saw somebody else advertise in the Dallasite once
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh  thought about putting an ad in the newspaper also but then i might just get too much business
 	
 	
 		yeah you really you have to be a little more selective
 	
 	
 		but i
 		right
 	
 	
 		you might even want to consider cold calling a couple of places for or checking the newspaper
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		there might even be cottage industries now listed in the newspaper because that's what it ends up being a cottage industry
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well i i found a uh book once in the library that had sources for um work at home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh
 		you know some of them required that you have a PC but most of those wanted IBM compatibles
 	
 	
 		yeah is that what yours is
 	
 	
 		and as as you know the TI PC  is not IBM compatible
 	
 	
 		i was thinking that they had recently come out with one that is
 	
 	
 		yeah they do the the um the Business Pro
 	
 	
 		ah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		which is that's what i have at work but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i still have the problem of upgrading mine either to a Business Pro or just going out there and buying a an I B M clone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		there
 	
 	
 		then i'll have three P C's
 	
 	
 		well they're real inexpensive to get the clones now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i don't know if you watch your sale ads very often
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but if you do particularly Best Buy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and Circuit City
 	
 	
 		and Circuit City i saw a three eighty six hundred and twenty megabyte hard drive with dual floppies and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		oh gosh the VGA color monitor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it also included quite a few other things i mean pieces of software and a mouse for about two thousand or less
 	
 	
 		well
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's a really nice package for about that much money
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i saw um
 		in fact i believe the one i saw was a three eighty six also it only had one one drive though but it had a hard drive
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know some of them have the little uh the the small
 	
 	
 		the three and a half floppy
 	
 	
 		yeah plus the the bigger one
 	
 	
 		those are nicer
 		those i prefer that over the larger floppy
 	
 	
 		um-hum i've never used one of those at all
 	
 	
 		they take up it you can get more information on the disk
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		no
 		i don't know what it is i guess because it's harder
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that you can get more information on it than you can on the larger ones
 		and they're a lot easier to transport because it's harder to to damage them
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't i didn't know that
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		being in the harder plastic case
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that's just a something that i've come across
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i'm gonna look into getting one of those I B M clones
 	
 	
 		well that's mostly um now that's what we have we don't have a real IBM i don't know of too many people who afford IBM
 	
 	
 		but
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		we've had not a minute of trouble out of ours not a minute
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i would i would recommend it to other people
