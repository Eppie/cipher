 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		um we have small children two and four and so we our dining is very limited  oh we're past that now we're a little sick of that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i bet you're a McDonald's fan
 		are you gosh where do you go Whataburger
 	
 	
 		no um
 		we're more like um you know like Wyatt's Cafeteria
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah that way and the kids just love everything that's there so we're pretty fortunate kind of um buffet style um so you can go in and go out and the food's already served and you don't have to wait and
 	
 	
 		yeah that's that's good
 	
 	
 		and it's already in front of them when you sit down and things like um Super Salads you know it's again it's buffet and
 		it's already prepared and just things any any eating area that you just don't have to wait uh an extremey amount of time
 	
 	
 		i can understand that we've had we got three kids too and uh when the kids are small if you're gonna wait you don't go out
 	
 	
 		we
 		no
 	
 	
 		they won't put up with that stuff
 	
 	
 		we tried a Bennigan's one time and it was terrible course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyways we we waited almost oh forty five minutes before everything was brought out and it was we were ready to go home
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and you and you had your kids with you and they waited forty five minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no  we fought with them for forty five minutes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't doubt that one bit
 	
 	
 		yeah so we we we rarely go eat in those kind of eating uh situations any more but we do love to eat out and um
 		and we do it as often as we can and and times that we do have baby sitters we we try and catch um some things that we normally wouldn't do yeah
