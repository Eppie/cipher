 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		did you hear the topic Carol
 	
 	
 		yeah something about uh returning goods and uh if they're getting any better than they used to be
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i haven't had any real uh recent problems with that  i've been a little bit leery i have mail ordered uh a uh video  camera from New York
 		and i was worried that that might uh cause me a problem but so far it looks like it has been a good deal
 	
 	
 		oh well good i feel the same way just the last few years things i've purchased have been
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know pretty good quality and worn well as far as clothes or have driven well as far as cars and sort of have lasted
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know for a good part
 	
 	
 		just  can you hold on just one sec
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i got a six year old that's  going out of  off of his mind  he acts like he just ate a pound of sugar
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i think i think the only problem i've had in the last two or three years is i was i was in Germany a couple of years ago and
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		bought a comforter and some pillows and some pillow cases i didn't receive everything but you know that's you sort of take that chance you buy something like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you buy um do you buy much mail order
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		do you buy much mail order
 	
 	
 		oh a little bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh have you had any problems with that at all
 	
 	
 		no i just bought one of those little handy dandy Singer sewing machines my wife you know when you're using you're the little small one that fit in your hands
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i purchased one of those the only complaint i might have there is it takes so long to get the item
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh yeah
 		well some some places are good about sending them out by UPS or or other ways but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i think most of the time i uh maybe it's just the kind of shopper i am i will uh decide on the kind of thing i want and
 		try to do my homework to to find which brand i think is probably going to be the best thing and uh generally i am you know pretty well happy with it afterwards sometimes you may find it uh on sale elsewhere but
 		uh maybe it's the kind of shopper determines what kind of goods you get know what i am saying
 	
 	
 		you bet yeah a lot of times i'll do the same thing one thing that happened recently is about three weeks ago i bought a new pair of glasses and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		two days after i bought them i picked them up and i went back two days later which is four days after i purchased them to uh
 		get them adjusted and i noticed they were running a thirty to sixty off sale so i paid the higher price so i did you know ask for a little interview with the manager and he came over
 	
 	
 		oh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he he granted me a few free goods you know to make up the difference
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well at least they're
 	
 	
 		which i thought was fair
 	
 	
 		trying to uh give you some kind of concession there
 	
 	
 		sure
 		but overall i think i'm uh
 	
 	
 		i'm trying to think what the last thing was that i turned in or wanted to take back
 		i bought some clothing i don't know if you get these Lands' End catalogs
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		they uh make mail order clothing and most of it's very good i bought five or ten shirts i would guess over the course of oh probably four or five years
 		and um they've been very good with the exception of one that had the uh button hole kind of pulled away from the front of it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		any trouble getting it back
 	
 	
 		no they're real good in fact i've had the shirt for uh actually i probably had it for over a year
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		and the only reason i called them on it is because i'd had similar shirts that held up for several years
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh they said uh regardless that you've you know worn it for a year or over a year we'll uh take it back and give you a new one
 	
 	
 		i try to buy most of my clothing from like the the bigger guys the uh the dealers of the world people like that because they they don't have any trouble returning goods they they purchase so much from these manufacturers you know they can return anything
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		so you're just generally speaking you never have a problem taking something back to them because it didn't wear properly or it came apart or something
 	
 	
 		well i think that's uh that's really just good business you know
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		if you want repeat business which a lot of those retailers do you've got to really bend over backwards to treat the customer and make him feel like they have occasion to go back and wanna go back
 	
 	
 		you bet
 	
 	
 		you know that's like i've seen on this mail order if they were uh skin flints about it and wouldn't take it back
 		i mean they they uh depend on that kind of a reputation so much
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		yeah mail mail order the same thing i buy a few things from Kebelsk
 	
 	
 		oh yeah this they're sporting aren't they uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right and sporting goods and uh sort of the same way you can uh have uh have a certain amount of time period while you can just return something if you're dissatisfied with it in anyway and they're very easy get along get along with and they don't mind taking something back
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh  you said you'd bought uh cars recently what kind of cars have you boughten
 	
 	
 		i bought a Lincoln
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		up with the exception of someone hitting me and uh me tearing it up a little bit
 		it's been a very nice car about a ninety one it's about a year old now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh you haven't had any problems with it though huh
 	
 	
 		no not really you know it's like the old uh saying they don't build things like they used to and i really believe that in some situations but in probably in cars that's very true
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they don't build them like they used to but
 	
 	
 		what's your feeling about American versus foreign and
