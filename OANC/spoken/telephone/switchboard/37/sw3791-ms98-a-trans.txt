 		uh-huh
 		hm
 		so i guess it's supposed to be dinner party is that what they said
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh uh yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party and uh what kind of dishes you might have for it or some sort of thing like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		we don't
 	
 	
 		let's see a good dinner party menu
 	
 	
 		thank you
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i suppose it would just about depend on who was coming i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum  um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 		uh something light and easy if it was pretty informal informal about anything
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well sometimes we'll have uh we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer
 	
 	
 		roast chicken
 		oh gosh yeah how do you usually cook your deer how do you usually cook your deer
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 		how do we usually on the grill we'll take the back strap and soak it in Italian dressing for a couple of hours and throw it on the grill and it is good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i imagine
 	
 	
 		real good
 	
 	
 		i would imagine it is
 	
 	
 		either that or hamburgers we really don't have dinner parties
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i understand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we just had uh
 		deer stew sort of uh deer deer steak stew
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what was it about
 		a day day and a half in the crock pot um uh some deer steaks
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		ooh  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in kind of a mushroom gravy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um some veggies and a
 	
 	
 		did you kill the deer
 	
 	
 		delicious no no the times i've been out deer hunting i i i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa
 	
 	
 		no
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so no this this was given to us by some friends
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um guy was in a uh
 		in a hunting club
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and you know but the whole group goes out hunting and then at the end of the day they split it and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share and the rest of it's split with the rest with everybody in the group
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh well that's nice
 	
 	
 		well he wound they  they went out last year and almost everybody got it the limit so there's everybody had deer coming out their ears
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah we still got some from last year
 	
 	
 		yeah they they gave us some deer and some of it's still in the freezer and they was about eight months ago they gave it to us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		no
 		we we either crock pot deer or we'll uh you know put it out on the grill so that so that the bulk of the uh tallow will dribble off of it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah we have we usually have most of it made into uh hamburger meat though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and cook you know spaghetti with it  chili
 	
 	
 		yeah that is good
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		deer spaghetti is real good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		anyway um
 		no i think if i was going to have a dinner party i'd probably have uh
 		sandwiches or
 		something along those lines and then uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		you know just something light finger food sort of something or
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		or maybe have something roasting out on a fire
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		oh well anyway um we don't do much in the way of entertaining but usually it's one other couple come over for a dinner
 	
 	
 		a hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		let's see what did we have the last time we had guests over ah yeah we had a uh a turkey loaf
