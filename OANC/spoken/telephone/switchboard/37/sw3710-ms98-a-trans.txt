 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh okay uh do you live in a a single family dwelling as they call it
 	
 	
 		yeah  i uh i'm buying my own home
 	
 	
 		okay what sort of house is it
 	
 	
 		um well it's a one story three bedroom two bath two car garage
 		with a single living area a large single living area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		garage is that an actual closed in garage or is that carport type of thing
 	
 	
 		no it's a a closed in garage to attached to the house
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so that i can uh i can leave my home go into the garage get in the car and not get into any weather at all
 	
 	
 		never actually be out of the house
 		yeah around here they tell you if it if the advertisement for houses for sale says garage
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it it it could mean anything from a uh part of the house all closed in to a uh uh nice corrugated fiberglass roof kind of hanging in the middle of the yard somewhere
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding that's crazy
 	
 	
 		yeah most of them are carports you know they'll be attached to the to the to the house but it'll just be a an extension of roof to over you know one or two parking spaces where
 	
 	
 		to the home uh-huh
 		wow
 		uh-huh most of the time when i had when i was looking for a house matter of fact the
 		they would tell you if it were a carport or if it were um
 		if it were a detached garage
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		now y'all aren't quite getting all that flooding that Texas has been getting have you
 	
 	
 		ah yeah  we're getting part of it uh-huh it's um
 	
 	
 		you're getting part of that uh uh
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it's really kind of odd we ah we had hoped not to be in too much of it and matter of fight matter of fact in in Texas
 		they have flood plain areas where it's every about every hundred years the area floods where the insurance companies won't insure you for it
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 		what
 	
 	
 		like uh
 		like what is i'm trying to think of the name of that park
 	
 	
 		there's areas that are so bad about flooding that they just don't cover them
 	
 	
 		they yeah they wouldn't cut they will not issue flood insurance
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and i can i can see where there's some areas in Dallas that are definitely like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		you know come to think of it it's that way around here too i mean you know there there's nothing even vaguely resembling hills around here
 	
 	
 		oh no huh we have
 	
 	
 		which was real confusing when i first moved into this area because it
 	
 	
 		was it what kind of uh home are you in
 	
 	
 		well actually right now my wife and i are living uh campus housing
 	
 	
 		oh okay is it uh apartment style or uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		they're apartment buildings one and two and three bedroom places uh be like you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 		like uh twenty five or thirty units per building and then something like uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		twenty five thirty buildings
 	

 	
 		gosh
 	
 	
 		about half of them are
 		one bedroom places
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's a pretty good number of two bedroom places and then there's like uh fifteen or twenty three bedroom places
 	
 	
 		three bedroom uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh oh they're not really too bad they're they're basically cinder block places
 	
 	
 		well i was that's kind of what i had envisioned from uh visiting the ones in at North Texas University where my husband just graduated
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah graduated in in what
 	
 	
 		uh physics
 	
 	
 		physics
 	
 	
 		PhD in physics
 	
 	
 		wow sounds like fun
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i i've got a physics couple of physics classes facing me this summer this summer so
 	
 	
 		uh actually they're they're very enlightening and they're a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah uh from what i've seen of it i mean you know there's a lot of things that kind of dabble in the edges of physics before you actually get into the class
 	
 	
 		they are
 		yeah well most everything touches physics one way or another no matter what you do even if nobody tells you that's what it is it's it's physics
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		yeah i remember a a teacher in high school saying that uh he enjoyed physics because it it improved his uh his uh pool game
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh yeah mathematics too but
 	
 	
 		uh anyway
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh back to housing what kind of a home would you and your wife look for
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		once uh once you finish schooling
 	
 	
 		um well
 		once we get out of school we're hoping to get into the mountains somewhere
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		probably out west um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh Oregon Oregon or Washington
 	
 	
 		yeah more than likely uh the rainy side of the mountains somewhere
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that's a beautiful area
 	
 	
 		but uh um originally i'm from West Virginia in the Appalachian Mountains
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh uh long since fell in love with living in the mountains but it'd probably be like a two story possibly even a three story if we build our own we might even get a little crazy and you know build into the side of a hill
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		and do it the
 	
 	
 		that would probably
