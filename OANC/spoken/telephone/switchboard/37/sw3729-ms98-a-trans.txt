 		really
 		you know i just did last week as a matter of fact um i'm wondering if their subject is more uh products by mail or things that you buy at the store but um
 		i bought something through the mail through a merchant through a company that's generally got pretty good products and
 		i was really impressed with the way they handled the return policy they sent UPS to our door to pick it up free of charge  which is such a an unusual always have to go to the
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		post office or some place to return it usually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh was this Spiegel by any chance
 	
 	
 		it was Hannah Anderson the children's um clothing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		don't know  that one i know Spiegel does that and yes and uh to me that's very impressive to think that
 	
 	
 		do they
 		it really is
 	
 	
 		but well and did you have any problem obviously had no problem with returning it
 	
 	
 		it took a while because it was the holiday weeks um
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		it was difficult to know when the person was going to arrive we're we're fortunate in that my husband works most of the time out of our home so he was here but
 		it would've probably been an inconvenience if if it had been a home pickup and and we hadn't been here but they were also willing to pick up at work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		did
 		did you return it because it was defective or because you just didn't like it
 	
 	
 		it was defective we returned it for the same thing um in a little larger size but it seemed that it was stitched uh around the collar such that the second time she wore it it uh it ripped
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and and i think that's unusual for that company because they do usually have pretty good products but to to answer the question that we were posed about whether things tend to be poor quality i think definitely i think a lot of the things that um
 		are not necessarily low price tend to be manufactured in a lot of cases as if they were lower priced
 	
 	
 		well i know what you mean because a couple years ago i remember i was in one of the nicer department stores and looking at it was one of the designer T-shirts or some sort of thing like that and the thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it was very expensive you know as they always are and it was a piece of junk you know stitching was terrible i think that they were trying to just you know play on a name
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly yeah and it it's unfortunate you really cannot depend on the the department store's name for that necessarily i don't know if you have Nordstroms in Dallas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no we don't i've been to one of the Nordstroms in um uh New York
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		nice store
 	
 	
 		they are really nice stores and i think i assumed in the beginning that they would probably carry carry overall pretty good merchandise you you have to be just as careful there as you do at any other lower priced store
 	
 	
 		do you really
 	
 	
 		yeah surprisingly
 	
 	
 		do you have Lord and Taylor there
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		um uh we're originally from Saint Louis and we came down to Dallas and they have Lord and Taylors here and i look at a lot of their house brands and i am very impressed with the quality of some of the house brands in some of the stores
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		does Nordstroms carry their own house brand
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um you know i don't know that i bet they probably do but i i'm not sure that i've
 		associated some of what i've seen as lines that they always carry as their own brand or just something that they've um gotten at a at a lower uh price because it's a large volume some of their children's lines
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i tend to look there for kids' things because they don't they they sometimes have things that you can't find elsewhere because they have a pretty large variety but not often for myself
 	
 	
 		do you shop by mail quite a bit
 	
 	
 		not that much actually i  used to i think before i had a child and because you end up paying for the shipping and handling and everything um
 	
 	
 		it's not as inexpensive
 	
 	
 		and you don't always have the convenience of returning it if it's not right uh i i tend less often to do that today than i might've ten years ago
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's the only problem that i see because uh my sister gets tons of catalogs and passes them on to me and i look at things and they have some gorgeous clothes but the problem is that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you can't always go by sizes you know you'll go to a department store and try on three different sizes in three different manufacturers and they all fit you know differently but uh that's the main thing is that i can't tell
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		whether the thing is going to fit or not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so i tend not to mail order
 	
 	
 		whereas you might take a chance in a store and bring it home and consider it you
 	
 	
 		but
 		i
 	
 	
 		you find that it's a lot more inconvenient to have to have to arrange for returning it if it's by mail
 	
 	
 		well personally i always try on before i buy anyway i just it amazes me when i talk to people that they buy like they buy a bunch of clothes and they don't try anything on they take them home
 	
 	
 		oh really no i meant even if you've tried it on i i'm thinking about some clothes buying for kids or your husband or something it
 	
 	
 		oh okay well that's a different story right
 	
 	
 		yeah it is funny you know i'm also amazed at uh
 		that i read about those i don't know anybody who does this but that people buy clothes and wear them and then think that they can return them
 	
 	
 		i hear about that too and that just appalls me i mean that's stealing really
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's what
