 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all righty
 		so how what do you think of capital punishment
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well Texas has capital punishment
 	
 	
 		oh does it
 	
 	
 		yep and uh
 		they go through a set of appeals that lasts seven years
 		and uh
 		there are so many cases here like Sixty Minutes is on right now here there are so many cases here where they proved that they've convicted the wrong person
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that i'm against it they should just give them life in prison
 	
 	
 		well i feel that way the only exception i think is qualifies for capital punishment is repeat offenders where the offender actually murders people repeatedly
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		like serial killers or someone who has been convicted more than three times on a murder charge and then gotten out on parole i don't think they should be able to get out on parole and do it again
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 		right uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's the only time i think it's really
 	
 	
 		well like in your state Charles Manson
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or the guy who killed all those children
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think i think those types of people deserve capital punishment
 		but i think they should restrict it strictly for repeat offenders or like i said serial killers because i mean a lot of times not a lot of times but quite quite a few times they've convicted innocent people on the first time
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but you know if they've been convicted like three times you know there something's wrong
 	
 	
 		something's going on right
 	
 	
 		so i think that's the only time it's really a necessary
 	
 	
 		yeah i think so too after after it's gone that far then they pretty well have a
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		enough proof that that person's
 	
 	
 		the guilty party
 	
 	
 		they can't be rehabilitated rehabilitated either so yeah
 	
 	
 		right
 		but that's really the only time when i agree with it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		most of the time i don't think it's a good idea because like you said there have been cases where they've convicted the wrong people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just because of circumstances
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but in Arizona which is where i'm originally from
 		they had a big thing about capital punishment there because we had like two serial killers within six months caught
 		and they had a big thing about whether they should you know go for capital punishment or not but it's not used in Arizona
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so they had a problem with it
 		unfortunately all the people got was sent to jail for a couple of years until they get paroled
 	
 	
 		right i never heard about those
 	
 	
 		unfortunately one of them killed a friend of mine so i was very much involved
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and when he got out on parole i was like
 		go ahead get out on parole
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		after that i had i had to tangle with him and the police caught him the second time and they still wouldn't do anything except send him to jail so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i definitely believe if they're repeat offenders they should
 		be
 		something to be done with them other than just sitting there for two years and then getting out and doing it again
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but a lot of states have outlawed capital punishment
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know which states in general
 	
 	
 		and that's that's the reason that Ted Bundy supposedly went to Florida
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		that was his primary goal was to to have the death penalty
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		because he started out in Washington and Oregon and traveled all the way across the country
 	
 	
 		huh i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		they had um
 		Mark Harmon played him they had a movie about it a few years ago
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		hum i didn't know that
 	
 	
 		and then of course there was a lot of publicity about it um the days before they killed him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		and he was really you know he was off the wall so
 	
 	
 		i don't know a lot of the crimes that are done nowadays it's like i think people have to be off the wall to do them but
 		i still don't believe capital punishment should be used unless they're repeat offenders
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but
 		i don't know i
 		once i finish law school i'll have
 		more probably more views on it
 		i'll be able to do something about it then
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah and some of the ways i think that um the way that Texas um executes the prisoners is probably the most humane way they use they do it by injection
 	
 	
 		oh do they
 	
 	
 		yeah instead of you know the electric chair the gas chamber that's
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		that would be the more humane way of doing it
 	
 	
 		yeah well they you know they just go to sleep and and then eventually they die
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		instead of being you know fried or
 		or
 	
 	
 		or stuck in a gas chamber until they finally pass on
 	
 	
 		yeah fighting fighting for breath right um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i know a couple of states
 		still believe in the hanging but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't i don't go for that either
