 
     		
 	
 		well you have do you have any pets
 	
 	
 		yeah i do i have a like a seven and a half year old dog
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he's kind of a big Benji long hair and he's white and he's the baby of the house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and tonight he has a friend visiting who's a pit bull so they're kind of running around chewing on things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 		uh-huh  yeah do you have any children  or
 	
 	
 		uh we have a child but he's like twenty so he's not like a chip you know like a little kid anymore
 	
 	
 		oh okay i see  yeah
 		uh-huh so whether um why do you have a dog what uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		why well actually we bought him for my son's thirteenth birthday and he's just been with us ever since and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we spend more on him on his haircuts and medical attention than we do ourselves
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and that's what pets are like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but he's like uh you got to have him when you come home and there's nobody here he's always here and
 	
 	
 		yeah  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's nice nice to have him there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what about you how come you don't have a pet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well mainly because it's just uh at this point in life i've had to be available to travel and we live in an apartment right now so um they're not even allowed here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh when i was growing up i always had cats and and then um
 		later i guess uh the last few years that i was at home  my mother and father got a dog and i learned to really appreciate dogs as well they're totally different types of pets but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i see how dogs are really faithful friends and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we were talking earlier tonight one of the ladies that's visiting with us tonight
 		her dog is her life
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah  and she has she has a German Shepherd  tried to tell her to get a husband and for something  and let the dog go but she's not for that she's in control  she's in control with the Shepherd
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		okay yeah that's true  yeah my dad  i think uh finds that he really enjoys his dog he says he's the best friend he has but uh
 	
 	
 		but uh  yeah
 		oh yeah uh
 		it's just
 	
 	
 		i don't know that's kind of sad though
 	
 	
 		i know our dog takes a nap everyday with my wife and he jumps right up in the bed and the whole bit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's just  when we first got him  we didn't like dogs around the house or in the house and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but now we put up with about anything
 	
 	
 		um-hum  yeah well i've seen that there's there's a lot of um you really have to appreciate their good qualities because there there are problems  yeah they leave a lot of hair around and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it it it's if like now you have to vacuum three or four times a week and it just i we didn't used to have to do that but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		yeah but obviously you find him worth it  or you'd get rid of him
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah
 		yeah could never get rid of him  yeah you get you get attached i think that like maybe the first year of his life we didn't get attached
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we were kind of timid about it and because we'd we'd all we'd all had dogs as kids and lost them or something and  and  we do we were afraid to but he kind of rooted his way in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and hey i know at times when he's had emergency problems we're just a nervous wreck
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's that's part of being a pet owner these days
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't know but cats i don't know you can have a cat in the apartment couldn't you
 	
 	
 		isn't it
 		well not this one i it's not allowed here but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah the thing i like about cats is they're more independent you can leave them and they can take better care of themselves than a dog it seems like you know depends
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um we never had much luck with cats we had some when we lived in New Mexico and coyotes ate them  so
 	
 	
 		oh wow yeah
 	
 	
 		we were kind of timid about having cats and again plus we we found out that when they were kittens we really liked them and as they got older they kind of ignored us
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah they'll do that sometimes
 	
 	
 		so
 		but with a dog they don't do that
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when i was a kid i i raised parakeets
 	
 	
 		oh really uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so those were i always thought those were good pets to have extremely messy  but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah oh i had goldfish but i didn't think much of those  they were they don't have any personality
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're fun but i like to look at fish one of our favorite restaurants here in town
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		has a humongous fish tank and i like to go there just uh the food's not that great but a fish tank's wonderful to look at them you know floating around
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		matter fact we got two dogs fighting right now  yeah
 	
 	
 		do you  well maybe i better let you go and go solve the conflict there
 	
 	
 		yeah well there's enough people here actually the pit bull is from Dallas he lives up he lives up there but they're down visiting and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's kind of unusual to have two dogs in the house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
