 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		my name is Ferrell
 	
 	
 		are you ready
 	
 	
 		
  
 		where are you calling from
 	
 	
 		i'm calling from Miami
 	
 	
 		Miami i'm in Utah
 	
 	
 		Utah well we've got a long distance connection tonight
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes it is definitely
 	
 	
 		you ready to start i am
 	
 	
 		sure go ahead
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you know the first thing i thought about whenever uh i don't have children but i um  have a friend who's a school teacher and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she has told me some horror stories but uh other than that i was thinking about um the the fact that uh so many uh kids nowadays can't even identify on the map on a globe where they are
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's just astounding to me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i uh have a little bit of a background well my wife taught school for about six years
 		and uh i'm almost convinced there's a lot of it has to do with environment uh
 		she taught in a poor area poor area here in Utah and they recently did a big article in the local paper about the S A T scores
 		in all the districts of the state
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		the district we're presently living in had like double the scores where she taught and it wasn't because she was a bad teacher or the teachers there were bad i think a lot of it has to do with the environment and the help the kids get from from home
 	
 	
 		yeah and i think you're right i think an awful lot of it has to do with uh  the kind of emphasis that uh
 		the children get uh at home on education because um uh this friend of mine who's a school teacher was telling me she said uh you know uh
 		that she has uh uh kids that uh are are Indian and Pakistani uh Oriental you know some of them who uh have only been uh in the United States maybe for two generations
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that uh she said their English is excellent uh their their social social skills are good and uh you know why is it that uh that they can be such model citizens and uh yet
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know other young kids uh uh kids who have you know been uh born and uh bred here in the US uh just don't seem to get it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well you know you see these documentaries on uh on Japan for example and the uh rigors they put their students through i mean their high school students are going six days a week
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh to get into college is uh no small feat there i mean just to be accepted i'm sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure on their on their children than than we do
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm beginning to wonder if maybe um year round school would not be a bad uh a bad thing
 	
 	
 		now we have that to a to a degree here that's only because we have a little bit of a of a problem that's i guess peculiar to Utah and we have a  a high population of young young people
 		young children one of the larger uh uh student teacher ratios  you know average class size is probably thirty five or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that poses another problem where the you know just the individual attention that's needed sometimes uh is lacking because of the you know the shear numbers of it  and what they've gone to is a year round program here where
 		uh in essence they have what they call tracks and you know the kids go year round
 		but you have uh you go like for uh eleven weeks and you're off for two or three then you go eleven weeks and so you have these these four periods rather than than the classic summer vacation
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		these are just mostly the elementary grades however
 	
 	
 		yeah well  i don't know i uh i uh
 		i don't certainly don't have the answer to it i know that uh um in Houston uh for example where i'm i have some friends who uh uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		were telling me that they have the option there of selecting the school that uh uh they want their kids to go to
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		regardless of where they live huh
 	
 	
 		yeah right and uh  the idea of running a a school
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		sort of like a business in a way such that if enough people are interested in sending their children there it it gets more funding and those schools that are less successful uh uh uh less successful get less money uh
 	
 	
 		oh that's that's interesting it's kind of like uh turning it over to the private sector to some degree
 	
 	
 		yeah the
 	
 	
 		and the the supply and demand works  yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's an interesting concept
 	
 	
 		but i don't know if that's the answer but i do think that there needs to be some changes made somewhere along the way
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i i  the stories you read about the competency and the literacy of the high school graduates for example
 	
 	
 		oh it's a nightmare
 	
 	
 		i can't believe it you
 	
 	
 		well and the very idea that anyone could graduate from high school and not and not know how to read or write it's scary
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's scary
 	
 	
 		yeah their their awareness of the of the uh current events and geography like you were mentioned early
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
