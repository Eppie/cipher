 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Mark i was wondering if you had any uh what do what do you like to do in your spare time
 	
 	
 		uh i like to play my guitar a lot and uh i i do a little bit of uh wood working out in the garage a lot
 	
 	
 		really have you had lessons guitar lessons
 	
 	
 		uh not really very formal i i took uh some classical guitar lessons from my church once but they weren't very good
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so i didn't really learn much from that i i generally learn how to play songs just by ear i i listen to it and and figure it out myself and then go from there
 	
 	
 		huh well have you ever wanted to play in a band
 	
 	
 		yeah i was i was in several bands when i was
 		some what younger and then i just kind of got tired of it because they were all a little pig headed and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		self centered didn't care about anybody else but themselves
 	
 	
 		well and bad hours too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that too
 	
 	
 		huh  well i um i like to play the piano i mean i like to dabble in it i don't play very well but uh i wouldn't say that was a hobby so much as um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i usually
 		you know i do some crafts and things but mostly out of necessity like if it's Christmas time or a birthday or uh we bought a house not too long ago and i needed some decorations and things for the walls and so i've done some
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um crafts and things to hang up but i don't do it i don't think so much out of enjoyment now do you do your woodworking for enjoyment
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um yeah i i usually do my wood working for stuff that i want and for just so that i don't have to you know it's it's cheaper to to build it yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i i i do it for monetary and personal enjoyment it's it's it's it's an accomplishment to finish something that you that you made by yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true is is it one of those uh things that you have to have expensive equipment for
 	
 	
 		um it really depends on what you're making uh if if you're making a piece of furniture yeah you'd generally need a a good you know table saw and everything uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if it's just some little old knickknack or something you can usually get away with a like a hand held saw or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything
 	
 	
 		sounds like it
 	
 	
 		my my dad's gotten into the to the the wood working stuff here lately and he's trying to make a a uh jewelry box for my grandmother for Christmas and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he didn't get it finished because he kept screwing up the lid for it but uh
 		he uh he doesn't know all the the safety rules and everything so i had to kind of keep him from taking off a finger or two and there's a couple of things he's done that i've like near had nearly had a heart attack over
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's like Dad you're doing it wrong
 	
 	
 		that's awful
 	
 	
 		you're gonna hurt yourself yeah but uh
 	
 	
 		that's pretty funny well i uh since my kids started to school um they have to have costumes it seems like every little bit they have like a pirate day and a Pilgrim feast and things and so i've done some
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and Halloween and
 	
 	
 		right so i've done some sewing and things but uh you know to meet the demands of all these costumes but um and i enjoy it in a way but um
 		it seems like we keep busy you know at work and at school and i volunteer a lot of places so that in my spare time i like to rest  and read
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i work i work out of the i work at a Renaissance festival down in Waxahachie and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i have to make my own costume for that out there and uh
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		it uh tries your patience sometimes because the the patterns aren't always the best things in the world they they draw you a pattern on a on a a piece of paper and you're supposed to like you know figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find somebody else that already has a good pattern and just copy it
 	
 	
 		well and there's a lot of people that enjoy sewing
 	
 	
 		yeah like my mom sew has sewn for years and years and years and years and years
 	
 	
 		hum but i have um you know done some knitting and some other crafts like that but not um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know not so much because it's all so expensive to go and collect all of the material and then the tools you need
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		one one one thing that is a lot of fun is to do calligraphy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i like that
 	
 	
 		i i took a couple classes in when i was in high school and stuff like that it's it's a lot of fun and it's fairly inexpensive you go out and get you two dollar pen that lasts forever and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and it's
 		right and it's functional so that you're always needing you know it's nice to do your Christmas cards
 	
 	
 		yeah you can do it yourself do your Christmas cards and invitations and things like that
 	
 	
 		yeah sounds good
 	
 	
 		or even something you just wanna frame and stick on your wall
 	
 	
 		yep that's right we have enjoyed that seems like um we've done a lot
 		too well has it has it been snowing that way wherever you are
 	
 	
 		uh i i live in Richardson just outside of Dallas it snowed snowed just
 	
 	
 		um-hum
