 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		no we just uh i guess i'm hot on this subject because we just spent three weeks camping
 		in a recreational vehicle
 	
 	
 		uh where did you go
 	
 	
 		we took a tour of Florida
 	
 	
 		well  interestingly enough i'm calling from Miami
 	
 	
 		okay well i was down there visiting the uh the orchid jungle
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there in uh Homestead
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		came back with about ten plants that i hadn't planned on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah we were down past Miami went down into the Keys
 	
 	
 		well you know that's something i've never done is go down to the Keys although i i'm just here on business but uh i would love to go down there
 	
 	
 		um well we found it a little bit of a disappointment uh we had expected some nice warm sunny days we got two days above seventy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we thought the beaches would be nice but uh
 		uh well Key West was uh just coral rubble
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh we did find Bahia Honda was a fairly nice state park it had a nice beach
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the water was running about seventy five degrees so it was kind of hard to get the kids to to go in and and snorkel and and do those sort of things
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well i've never done any motor home camping although uh uh it it is more attractive to me now than it used to be
 		when i was a kid uh we used to go camping up in the Ozarks in Arkansas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh  we found a pretty remote campground uh uh actually whenever we first started going to it you had to drive about twenty five miles on a gravel road
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to get back up into it and uh it had uh no electricity and uh it had a hand pump for water
 		but it was on a lake that was just crystal clear and we would spend a week up there you know and they had a a little country store about ten miles away that you could get you know minimal provisions so you pretty much had to carry everything you needed with you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh that was it was great fun but since then i honestly have not done much what you could call camping
 	
 	
 		hum
 		well my uh my wife talks a lot about camping and uh she's taken the girls uh on off to Girl Scout camp a couple of times
 		but my idea of camping is in a either an RV or in a thirty thirty five foot sailboat
 	
 	
 		yeah well now  yeah you kind of remind me of a friend of mine who who said her idea of roughing it is slow room service
 	
 	
 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh yeah i've got a uh i've got a friend of mine in Houston who has a forty two foot uh Tartan sailboat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it which has for me has been the best of all worlds because he's got the expense and i get the pleasure of going out on it
 	
 	
 		yeah i did that for a number of years i crewed for a fellow that uh was doing a lot of racing
 	
 	
 		well that's hard work
 	
 	
 		and uh and well it was fun it was quite enjoyable
 	
 	
 		yeah i've i've been with it on on several uh races we've run the Pensacola yacht race for a couple of years
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh but no i love to sail and i agree i had never thought really thought about that as camping before but that is that is probably one of the best ways to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what did you do did you rent a motor home when you came to Florida
 	
 	
 		yeah we rented one from uh Cruise America
 	
 	
 		was it what is that expensive
 	
 	
 		uh it was  running about eighty seven dollars a day
 	
 	
 		well that's cheaper than a hotel room really
 	
 	
 		that's cheaper than a hotel and you add uh oh maybe another twenty five dollars for that for a camp site
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you know the hookup and water and sewage and so forth
 	
 	
 		how big was the one you rented
 	
 	
 		we had a uh thirty two footer
 	
 	
 		yeah was that uh any problem driving or
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well it's it's a big truck uh but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when you get that big a truck the uh the fuel economy goes to pot if you try to push it at sixty five and you get pretty decent fuel economy at fifty five
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so uh i just uh had a change of mind set and i would set the uh autopilot on fifty five and just cruise down the highway well everybody else wants to speed so they wind up passing you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and you just stay in the right lane and there's nobody in front of you and all you have to do is guide it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so it's kind of a pleasant way to drive you
 		uh i've found that i get there just about as fast as anybody else because there will be some cars that i'll pass two or three times during the day the same one
 	
 	
 		oh sure yeah yeah that always irritates me when i pass somebody several times i've i've been in the other in the other uh uh uh had the shoe on the other foot
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah because you go down there and some hotshot will go by you that you know he's got a colorful car that you recognize and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the next thing you know you know it's lunchtime he's got to stop for lunch and you just holler at your wife to make you a sandwich
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah right right right
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and uh well we enjoyed it uh one of of places we visited was uh Walt Disney World
 	
 	
 		uh
