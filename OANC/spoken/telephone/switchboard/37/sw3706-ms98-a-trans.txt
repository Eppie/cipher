 		not a terrific amount to be honest with you uh
 		i really don't have much in the way of tools i'd like to get a router and uh some other things like that but i really don't have much how about yourself
 	
 	
 		i'm in about the same condition um had access to a fair amount of my father's place before i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		moved away but uh it's been several years ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i've always always enjoyed what chances i had to do wood working
 	
 	
 		you know i've made a just some simple things here just some shelves and uh
 		saw horses you know nothing real complicated  did a little bit of framing when i was going to you know in high school
 	
 	
 		
 
 		framing like picture framing
 	
 	
 		right yeah no uh uh home framing i guess that's not wood working that's construction i guess  but in high school shop you know like every body had to build a couple of things and i really liked it i thought it was a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh okay yeah okay well it was
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you do need the tools i don't have much in the way of tools to be honest i don't have a table saw or a drill press or any of that kind of stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah my
 		right now what i've got in the way of wood working tools is a circular saw and a uh square
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's it well a drill i do have a drill
 	
 	
 		no i've got a drill and i think i got a jig saw and i got a a circular saw but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		i don't know the wood working projects i've been involved with lately we uh
 		converted a uh a very large section of shelving from an a restaurant that went belly up into a small smaller set for the home it something for my text books and my computer to stand on
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um no
 	
 	
 		well that's kind of similar to what i've done  uh had a father-in-law that got a bunch of uh uh real nice heavy doors from a motel that went out of business
 	
 	
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		and uh they made a great table top so i made a nice work bench with a peg board back on it and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		it's smooth faced doors
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		these are like smooth faced doors
 	
 	
 		yeah they're solid core and uh they they made a real terrific uh table top for a for a work bench there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it would
 	
 	
 		so you know it's real steady and
 	
 	
 		that would make a good table top
 	
 	
 		well it's you know i watch this guy on TV once in a while
 	
 	
 		oh the fellow with the beard that's hooked up with Sears now
 	
 	
 		is it the New Yankee oh no no it's this other guy it's called the New Yankee uh Workshop i don't know if you've ever seen him or not
 	
 	
 		Villa or something like
 		doohinkey
 	
 	
 		new Yankee New Yankee
 	
 	
 		New Yankee Workshop
 	
 	
 		i think that's what it's called but he makes uh mostly furniture items you know he'll make a a mirror or a chest of drawers or a table
 	
 	
 		oh okay it's a series though
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it's fascinating to watch him work you know he does a terrific job but he's got every single thing you can imagine you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah he's got a he's got the sort of thing that that uh you know a professional shop would envy envy more than likely
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah he's he's got all the all those things you'd like and
 		and uh
 		that's the problem i watch him do those things and i say you know i probably could do that given a little bit of experience yeah
 	
 	
 		if i had yes
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if i had five or ten thousand dollars in equipment like i'm sure he has
 	
 	
 		yeah well actually a lot of that stuff you can still do but it just takes more time and and a lot more talent when you have you got limited resources
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that that's true you have to be better than than he is and  that's hard to do what gets makes you a little nervous when you you know you're on a real nice piece of hard wood you don't wanna mess up on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah it's expensive stuff and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		last piece of hard wood that i bought was uh let's see a a one by ten by
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		one one inch by ten inch by four foot piece of uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		of walnut
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		oh beautiful piece of walnut
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and now now for the life of me i don't know what i did with that board
 		i carried it around i i got it all sanded out and planed out and never did get done with what ever it was i'd originally planned to do with it and i think i wound up giving it to my little brother
 	
 	
 		oh
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		well i've been tempted once in a while to uh i don't know you have these uh community education programs
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		where you're adult education you can you can take a class in the evenings where you go at the local high school or the community college and sign up for a wood working class i've been tempted to do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i have some a friend that made a microwave stand and some you know some other kinds of things like that did a nice job and then you know then you can use their stuff
 	
 	
 		i've
 		well it's one night a week and i think it's something you'd probably really enjoy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know i was uh thirty three and i and just started college
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i mean going into it was like oh it sounds you know like it'd be fun but and i had all kinds of little buts that never really amounted to much but
 		you know when i finally got into it i was so glad i did
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well  well that's the one hobby i'd like to develop more  i'll be honest with you uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it it it's i mean hobbies like that are therapeutic too
 	
 	
 		it'd be
 		yeah
