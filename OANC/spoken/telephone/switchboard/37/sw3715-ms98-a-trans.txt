 
     		
 	
 		um well i'm glad i got a male because  i'm gonna need some help um i haven't really given any dinner parties but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i've had you know friends over for lunch that kind of thing but i promised my husband that i would throw him a Super Bowl party and so he's real excited about it but i don't know what men like to eat because  it's different from women
 		so um maybe you could help me out here in this sense and i keep i keep asking him you know what what what do you think we ought to have you know but i was thinking of like you one of those subway sandwiches those long subway sandwiches and maybe uh
 	
 	
 		well i
 	
 	
 		um a pasta salad and some chips and some beer and some Coke and um i thought a cake and he said no and so we're just going back and forth so
 	
 	
 		you you could probably probably get  uh the sub might work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the beer will definitely work a lot of that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh chips and dips will probably work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah he's i don't really think men care do they
 	
 	
 		uh not really to be honest with you i mean i i've never i've never really cared i just like little munchies and stuff basically you know just dip chips and dip usually do it if there's enough of it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's what he said
 		right
 	
 	
 		but
 		males usually aren't into meals you know like more than and not as much as women you know like just sitting around and eat the finger sandwiches and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and  but uh i've always i've always you know just had chips dip and beer and just gone for it from there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah so that oh okay i'll guess i'll do something like that but um
 	
 	
 		i got a i got a good dip
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah i i stole it from a restaurant
 	
 	
 		okay what is that
 	
 	
 		it is uh you get a can of can of uh chopped spinach
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you get uh fresh Parmesan Cheese
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you get uh uh artichoke hearts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay you get uh a whole can of artichoke hearts
 		you take about out of the i tell you out of the it's about a four ounce can of spinach out of that you take about an ounce and a half to two ounces of spinach
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay you stick all of it in a food processor
 		okay you need to get uh
 		and you grind mix it up real good it's almost pureed
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to a degree and you heat that up
 		and you take uh i'd say approximately eight ounces of the fresh Parmesan Cheese and you uh put it in there while it's heating up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you mix it up
 		and this is a recipe from Houston's restaurant
 	
 	
 		oh really is this an artichoke dip because a friend of mine had that at at one of her parties and it was really good but when she told me it was artichoke dip i was going oh no
 	
 	
 		that i stole yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah this is artichokes spinach and parmesan cheese and that's all that's in there
 	
 	
 		as i'm not much of a fan for artichoke
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sorry and heavy it has heavy cream in it too
 	
 	
 		that one see i thought that was something else
 	
 	
 		i forgot forgot about that
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it has heavy cream in there i i i just i fling it every time i do it i
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		mean i don't have anything written down i just kind of know it from i just go by taste and texture
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i've never really written it down but they never give me any specs on it i've just kind of
 		had a variance of it you know every time i go in and it gets pretty close you've just got to watch how much spinach you put in there you've got to put it a little bit at a time it should be a uh
 		uh uh like about a guacamole lighter than a guacamole color
 	
 	
 		yeah that's a party it sounds like the same thing my friend served and it was really good but when she told me it had artichokes in i thought oh God
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's served
 		yeah and it's served hot
 		it's served hot
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh it was
 	
 	
 		it yeah and it's real good i don't know if they'd go for that or not but it's just a real good dip
 	
 	
 		well my husband loved it yeah he really did
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a fancy i think in Houston's it's called a Chicago dip
 	
 	
 		oh really huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		if you ever go there try it that's the stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah okay yeah and he wanted uh uh some uh chili dip that i usually make too so
 	
 	
 		chili is usually guys usually go for chili now that you now that you mention it
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		probably go for chili and beer that's always a good gas burner
 	
 	
 		and no women and children allowed  and i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's right
 		plenty plenty of  ceiling fans going
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so well um let me see we went to a Christmas party and uh a friend of mine had this and it was she had the she was the one that had that dip
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and another thing that my husband really liked that i and i liked too that i would have never thought of serving and it was really easy
 		um and it sounds it doesn't sound good but when you all put when you put it together and you taste it it's real excellent it's um the Mexicorn and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and corn chips you mix all that together with a bottle of the Catalina dressing and you and you just mix it all together and you serve it like that and it is really good
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
