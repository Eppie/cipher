 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh
 		what kind of fishing is there up in Utah
 	
 	
 		well there's quite a quite a bit of different kinds lot of people go uh stream fishing
 		and we have a a few lakes uh right now they're uh doing a little bit of ice fishing on some of the lakes i personally don't fish a lot fish a great deal uh
 		got kind of a young family it's
 		you know it's not something that we're really into there's couple of good trout farms that are close by that we go fish at just with the kids for fun
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how about yourself what do you enjoy
 	
 	
 		well i was i was raised on Alabama coast and i like salt water fishing
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and Dallas is there's quite a few lakes around here i've
 		done some fishing from the shore i don't have a boat which you really need to get out into the lakes uh you know really do any good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i've
 		i've caught a few striped bass from the shore some of the small ones
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then catfish and stuff i haven't done a lot since i moved to Dallas
 	
 	
 		how long you been there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		off and on for ten years we were here
 		six years and my wife got homesick we moved backed to Alabama Mobile spent about eight months and moved back to Dallas because the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		wages and all were better up here
 	
 	
 		oh i have a the only reason i'm in the program is i've got a brother and a well a sister that lives in Plano and so they uh they uh get involved in this we went out to a lake one time when i was visiting them i can't even remember what it was called it was a pretty good sized one
 		seem like there were a few guys fishing there from the shore is all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i never caught anything or never been uh salt salt water fishing that sounds like you know kind of be a lot of fun i've seen these guys that
 		well you go on a vacation and they go out in the big boat and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		go deep sea fishing you ever done that
 	
 	
 		yeah i did that a couple of times the company i had worked for in Mobile they had a
 		couple of bunch of us guys got together and we and chartered a boat and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		went out caught red snapper and one guy caught a ling
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i caught a few what they call trigger fish
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the it wasn't
 		some of the snappers that much not that much fun they don't really i mean uh yeah they they don't fight at all it's just pulling dead weight you know
 	
 	
 		they don't fight
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah and we'd constantly getting our lines tangled up with people people fishing on both sides of the boat so
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it was one uh fish were good but it was kind of a hassle
 	
 	
 		i got a brother-in-law just got back from a trip to Alaska
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh he said that was quite a bit of fun uh i guess the salmon are pretty good fighters and uh they went uh out in the you know more of the deep sea fishing as well caught a fair amount of halibut
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they say the halibut are are a pretty good fighter too
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		they're an odd fish i don't know if you ever seen i guess they lie on the flat on the bottom of the ocean and they only have one eye or or just a small eye on the other side
 	
 	
 		okay well we we catch flounder on the coast which is about the same thing
 	
 	
 		as halibut
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do they put up a fight or not
 	
 	
 		uh well they hug the bottom they
 		they don't run that much but they they
 		somehow they hug the bottom and it's kind of you find it's a pretty good struggle to put them in you know pull them in once they get
 	
 	
 		once you get them over to over to the side of the boat because they're they're pretty pretty weighty fish are they yeah do you net those or i guess you have to huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		uh
 		i've caught i've caught one on a hook with live shrimp i've
 		caught several of them in cast nets
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah about yeah you would have to net them to get them in the boat because they really have a small mouth and all
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i've i've fished mostly you know
 		when i was on the coast in the in the bays and stuff in a little you know plywood skiff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		well the  water's kind of brackish so i
 		i catch a mixture of salt water and fresh water fish right with
 		right on the coast you know i catch
 		catfish in the bayou and go
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a half a mile and catch a you know salt water fish
 	
 	
 		you know i've never eaten catfish are they good eating
 	
 	
 		yeah they they real good they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so that i guess
 		you know people on the coast and all consider them that's the best around
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		kind of an ugly looking fish are they  great big whiskers on them
 	
 	
 		yeah they they
 		yeah they are and they're bottom feeders if you
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		if you get them out of real muddy water then they got a muddy taste to them but if you
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know catch them out of clear running water they they're pretty good
 	
 	
 		taste a little better yeah well these trout that we catch are real good i i quite enjoy those uh they this place where we go with uh with my six year old they uh filet them for you right there for only like ten cents a fish i mean it's well worth it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you just fry them up right
