 
     		
 	
 		did you hear our topic and it's in regards to discussing homes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		homes yes sir um-hum
 		what are are you settled in a place
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm settled in a place i've been in it for twelve years since nineteen uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy eight
 		in it's in Richardson Texas which is North Texas or North Dallas
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we've lived in two houses in Richardson we moved here in seventy four  and uh changed locations in seventy eight
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		how about yourself
 	
 	
 		well we uh left here in seventy six uh we were here for a few years then we uh have come back just this summer right now we're looking for housing
 		uh somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area are you familiar that
 	
 	
 		yes nice area
 	
 	
 		yeah it is the kids are in school here in Duncanville we're in a temporary place right now and uh so they've enjoyed the school so we're kind of trying to stay here but
 	
 	
 		are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or
 	
 	
 		well what the problem we got is that we've got five children
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		and so uh we really want four or five bedroom house and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing so we uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		right right
 	
 	
 		we look at the paper we look at our talk to our realtor and you can cut you know the listings uh in about a third and when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five are you looking or you settled i mean having having finished
 	
 	
 		sure
 		no we're settled and uh
 		we're uh
 		i'm probably older than you i'm fifty two but anyway i my youngest is getting married this year and graduating college so i can board up their rooms and  look forward to retirement maybe
 	
 	
 		oh great
 		
 
 		that empty nest syndrome is gonna set in i guess
 	
 	
 		oh gosh so we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere closer closer to our families
 	
 	
 		
 
 		great
 		okay
 		okay you are you from Florida originally
 	
 	
 		no i'm from West Virginia but everyone's uh my wife's parents are from the New York New Jersey area
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but everyone seems uh has seemed to relocated down that area seems like a nice place to go
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah yeah we've got five and the oldest is uh ninth grade and the youngest is second grade and i think they're gonna be uh with us forever
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i don't know if that's true but it's sure you know we're we're not anywhere near looking to uh uh cut down in size we're we're trying to find the
 	
 	
 		oh i understand you need very minimum of four and probably five
 	
 	
 		oh yeah in fact six would be real good my wife and i can share a bedroom  and there
 	
 	
 		as far
 		right
 		it's tough to find a five and six room bedroom house isn't it
 	
 	
 		oh i don't think it's possible unless you you know multimillionaire something like that yeah
 	
 	
 		oh i know seems like when you get in that category you're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever and it's that's an awful lot you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah it is yeah we're um we're having actually
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		if we find something for uh i'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right you know that's uh but i think the thing's out there it's just a matter of uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know looking you know finding the right place uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		matter of looking right
 		lot of people will will buy a four in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do or do something i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and she had uh there were seven kids in her family
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		and they converted the dining room and and did this and that they always seemed to get along fine you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yeah yeah i think once we get into a place it'll be just fine but um you know it's until then it's uh
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing that's all
 	
 	
 		oh i know and it's  there's nothing harder than that i always just sort of a
 		assign my wife that chore then i would let her narrow it down to three or four then i'd go look because
 		women seem to like to look a lot more than men do
 	
 	
 		oh yeah maybe that's the case at least she's got more opinions you know there's uh
 		seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about you know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know
 	
 	
 		yes
 		why certainly
 		i understand that
 	
 	
 		so what what kind of business are you in
 	
 	
 		i'm in the uh sporting goods business i'm a manufacturer's rep i represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies
 	
 	
 		oh yeah great
 	
 	
 		who who are you with
 	
 	
 		uh we're with an organization called uh Wycliffe Bible Translators it's a a missions organization and uh doing uh translation linguistics that sort of thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well great
 	
 	
 		uh it's got an office down here in uh it near Duncanville and we just moved down to be on staff down here so
 	
 	
 		how how was the uh you say you say you lived in the Denver area before how did that compare with this area as far as housing housing prices
 	
 	
 		it
 		right
 		uh we were uh
 		really surprised to find that they're higher here uh
 	
 	
 		no kidding
 	
 	
 		when we moved from Louisiana to Denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected and then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower and they're not
 		i guess um
 		really prices for housing are just
