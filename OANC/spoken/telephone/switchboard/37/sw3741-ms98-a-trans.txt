 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		family with children or
 	
 	
 		uh yes in fact i'm i'm i've got grandchildren
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so what do you find yourself spending most of your time doing with them
 	
 	
 		uh spending uh
 		oh just visiting back and forth fortunately when your children get up in their thirties
 		they finally grow up  you get to enjoy them
 	
 	
 		that's true and then you just get to spoil the grandkids and send them home right that's what my mom always says
 	
 	
 		right right right
 		yeah do you have children
 	
 	
 		yeah i have one little daughter she's just a year and a half
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i think about all we ever do is just pick up after her it seems like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		she's not too good at just sitting down and doing any one thing her attention span's only a couple of minutes i think and then its on to the new little mess
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm sure you remember those days
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but and we try and sit and read to her she's really good she'll bring us books so we read a lot of books to her and stuff but
 		i can't they got to be just a lot of pictures and not too much else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		or else she loses her loses a attention the attention's not that interesting to her for very long
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think one of the very most important
 		was i i guess about the most important thing that you can do for small children like that is to read to them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and get them to love books
 		before they ever start to preschool
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i was very fortunate in having an older sister who read to me constantly and uh so i was i went to school in the days before public kindergarten
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh uh i had practically all the fairy stories read to me before i started to school so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and it
 	
 	
 		uh uh i made great strides and i i'm sure you'll experience the same thing
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah i i uh my mom used to spend quite a bit of time and
 		i i've carried it through i love to read now and and uh that's why we've we've made it a point whenever she brings us a book that we don't you know we always sit down with her right then and read it so that we try and instill that on her that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that uh it's something good to do but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's kind of cute because she'll just come and she'll just start you know kind of not whining but just letting us know that it she wants us to read this book and it's the same one over and over and over again it seems like but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i guess like you say she it's something so she at least she gets in the habit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah we uh  my wife works at a day care part time and she's able to take her with her there but she she works with a lot of kids whose parents you know it's they drop them off at six in the morning and then pick them up at six at night and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then they're proud if their kids are in bed by eight you know which means they only get to spend about two hours a day with them and i just kind of wonder
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know there's
 		there's a lot to be said with with parents you know for parents spending time with their kids that's for sure
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		other than just you know putting them in front of the TV or something like that
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		i have a kind of a hard time with that but
 		it's uh i think it's fair to say you get more of a there's a lot more love and they don't have to go elsewhere to find the the attention and stuff if the parents are spending time doing stuff with them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		
 
 		how many children did you have do you have
 	
 	
 		i have three three yeah
 	
 	
 		three and how many grandchildren
 	
 	
 		uh eight
 	
 	
 		eight oh that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah we uh my mom and dad just well they have three grandchildren now each of my brother and sister each we each have one but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they're they're fond of like i say they like to keep them for a couple of hours but boy when they send them home with us they sure you know it cause they have been spoiled to death
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they like them but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh they they're looking forward they like i say they've been looking forward to the time when they could just send them home with their with their parents as opposed to having to keep us all the time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 	
 	
 		i i think one of the hardest things to do with children is to be consistent and and uh in your discipline cause some days when you're feeling pretty good you wouldn't mind letting them get away with murder then on days when you don't feel well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		yeah  well how do you do
 	
 	
 		what do you mean you didn't do this
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how did you do that i mean you know as far as having to tell them no or slapping their hands or something like that that's that's what we struggle with
 	
 	
 		oh oh gee i i i i did a lot of the wrong things i'm sure
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh uh that that was the hardest thing i found was to be consistent and if
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i i tried to keep as few rules but well really about the only rule i had was they couldn't play on the top bunk and they had to confine their eating to the kitchen
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah  those are the ones that save you a lot of time and energy
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah yeah and uh so
 		uh
 		i don't know they all turned around out okay so
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's the important thing and they probably appreciate all you did for them so
 	
 	
 		well i i think so and um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we're just like i say we just all i keep hearing is from my mom is just you wait you know you'll get all that you ever gave so  i could be in trouble but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i say they they're a handful that's for sure we i just last night uh she
 	
 	
 		yeah
