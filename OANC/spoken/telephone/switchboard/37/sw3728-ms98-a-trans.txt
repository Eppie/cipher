 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		okay what um
 		do you watch much TV or
 		you know
 	
 	
 		um no i don't watch much TV sometimes um usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news but i don't think of that every day even
 	
 	
 		the news yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i think i get most of my current events well i get them from everywhere i sometimes watch TV if i i guess i watch TV if i haven't read the paper that day we don't get a paper but i work um
 		at a i teach college class and uh there's a the library has a paper and so i often drop in on a break and
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and read it and then i keep the radio on quite a bit when i'm home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then i i figure if there's big big news i'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or  someone else you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah yeah now i also i get it from all over i watch the news every day and i have we have a news you know we get the newspaper and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		magazines anything anything you know i'm i read a lot so i get um you know i'm i'm really up on uh current affairs i get you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the news and and everything
 	
 	
 		yeah what's your favorite news do you do you get a news magazine or
 	
 	
 		um well i'm not getting any no i'm not getting any news magazines but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know as as i said i do
 		uh it's uh it's easy to keep up on current events you know on certainly you know especially when you um you know you get a paper every day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah we've got
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly are you satisfied with the quality of coverage
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know is there anything missing i you know i
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of hard to know isn't it
 	
 	
 		and i don't know you know what what's i mean what are we supposed to uh
 		compare it to  you know i mean the quality uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		whatever they tell you you know i uh
 		i guess i'm uh i you know i'm satisfied i mean i uh
 		you you you know they're they're supposedly covering everything that happens so  you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well i do feel like a little bit like being from California and
 		wanting to hear like i've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something and i don't ever hear it in the news here you know it's um
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		oh
 		well uh sometimes it's such a you know it's it's so um
 		slight you know like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		paper but most of the time the times i find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there uh you know there'll be a small article in the paper about it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		yeah i sometimes feel like um the Dallas paper and the Dallas News
 		um the top headlines are always a murder you know and that's because there's a high crime rate yeah
 	
 	
 		oh well that's what sells papers
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's um that's been like that since they the first newspaper you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i'm sure
 	
 	
 		you know but um
 		i don't know i i guess i'm satisfied i don't uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really we don't  get a you know
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 		that's true we certainly get enough coverage i mean we we
 		we can get news you know i mean there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty four hours a day so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i was gonna
 		sure
 		yeah sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's all so negative you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		often times
 		so
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well we have to keep talking i guess
 	
 	
 		well no i guess we can end yeah it's just whenever we're
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 		oh is it really
 	
 	
 		um yeah have you always gone until the recording
 	
 	
 		well yeah i don't i don't uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oops i guess we're not supposed to
 	
 	
 		i don't know we're supposed i guess we're supposed to wait or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		cause i you know like one  well was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh  and it was really funny i i i mixed it made the call and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away
 	
 	
 		oh really it just
 	
 	
 		yeah and it was really we were laughing i mean but you know we don't really do any gardening so like that took like a minute
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then we just talked about you know whatever i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  interesting yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		you know i mean some topics really now you know now this topic this is i mean there really isn't much to say after
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know you uh you know you you tell a person what uh news their a
 		you know where their where they find their sources of of information from and then you know if if it's uh if they're satisfied and that's about it really
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's hard to talk for five minutes on this
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um
 	
 	
 		yeah well i guess i can just say i uh  it bothers me that i hear a lot about um you know on the news that
 		well it seems like i don't know some things are sensationalized or some things are um you know you'll hear one report and then you'll hear that it you know they didn't um
