 
     		
 	
 		do work in a large organization now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um well i i work in a actually it's sort of an odd situation right now but uh
 		i have until recently been working in in a uh in a large organization
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i currently maintain an office still at at the place even though i i officially quit there a few months ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it's it's not really a large organization but uh nearly nearly five hundred people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah that's pretty big
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah how about yourself are you
 	
 	
 		i work in a hospital and i think probably there are about seven or eight hundred employees
 	
 	
 		that's
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i guess um the thing i was thinking about as i was pondering this question is um
 		besides salary it seems that people if it's a large enough place need to feel that their job's an important one you know that they have the respect of their fellow employees and their boss
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah not lost in the in the crowd huh
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah it's it's more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one
 	
 	
 		ooh yeah i i think it it's probably the thing is that it's always fairly obvious in a small one right because um yeah
 	
 	
 		right everyone's so integral
 	
 	
 		yeah everybody knows what everybody else is doing and and knows that it's
 		it's generally important
 	
 	
 		um-hum upward mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is probably an important one but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real important too
 	
 	
 		but
 		um um-hum
 		what what about what about uh advantages of large organizations i mean benefits and things
 	
 	
 		well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you know in a larger
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah when it when i've worked with a with i mean the the small things i've worked with really haven't had any uh any consistent
 		yeah or any any kind of quality package right i mean it just kind of leaves you on your own yeah i i've had my own little business and then i've worked for small businesses
 	
 	
 		really in health care uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and yeah the the the only ones that i've had large uh uh i mean i've had health care and and and other kinds of benefits with have been large organizations
 	
 	
 		uh-huh vacation and
 	
 	
 		also i work for the university and that that's a is very large organization
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		and were those good um considering the the size of that kind of organization did you feel like that you had good benefits
 	
 	
 		i you you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it i think so um the question you know i mean it's it's it's handy to have them i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without
 	
 	
 		um typically let's see uh typically the myself i i was covered myself but my family wasn't you know i had to chip in to for them to be covered but it was pretty economical
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		um especially relative to just buying your own health care package
 	
 	
 		right that really gets prohibitive
 	
 	
 		yeah and so you know so that's that's handy uh you know i think that it i'm amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead
 		uh because of benefits they figure uh i mean it's something like thirty five forty or fifty percent of of salary
 	
 	
 		yes i've heard that too
 	
 	
 		and  which is which is pretty amazing
 	
 	
 		it is especially especially if you consider in some situations people might actually use that much hopefully they budget for that and it doesn't get used up entirely but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's it's a lot i think that those sorts of advantages are nice i know um
 		my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband works for himself out of our home and and and office that's elsewhere but he doesn't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he didn't really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the security of an organization's benefits
 	
 	
 		i i think so yeah it really does um do you get other benefits besides health do you have life insurance and things like that
 	
 	
 		it it actually it's interesting just this last week um they introduced what the nineteen ninety two package was gonna look like and while the life insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to it's uh ten or fifteen thousand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it
 	
 	
 		right are
 	
 	
 		the rest of the package is pretty good it's vision and dental and you know all the full medical
 	
 	
 		oh well um-hum yeah that's good i I just had uh dental insurance for the first time uh from from an employer which i thought was was pretty handy really took advantage of it i think
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um do are you finding that that uh the packages uh that your benefits packages are shrinking
 	
 	
 		you know i've seen that all over the bay area in San Francisco bay area at least and probably true in California i haven't yet at our hospital we've kind of been waiting with baited breath we're the only hospital that i know of that doesn't have uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		a partial payment or i don't know if you call it copayment or premium by the the consumer
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh copayment uh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so as as of this date  my husband and my kids are free because they're dependents but i know a lot of other place like you were mentioning you know you pay if
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i i mean i
 		typically you typically pay for dependents and and not for yourself but i i've the you know my company the company i was working with really has has been um
 		you know they don't wanna cut back benefits but on the other hand they're real concerned about the rising costs and and sort of scaling uh uh you know keeping
 	
 	
 		exactly
