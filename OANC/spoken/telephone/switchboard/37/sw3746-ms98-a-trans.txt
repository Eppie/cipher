 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay um what kind of hobbies do you have Lori
 	
 	
 		um i guess uh i like to play golf
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um  i also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh where do you play golf or in this area
 	
 	
 		well we live uh pretty close to the Mesquite Golf Course
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we'll play either out there or at Firewheel that's usually where we play but i've played you know different courses in in the Dallas area
 	
 	
 		do you uh do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf
 	
 	
 		uh both  not at the same time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i was gonna say that could be difficult
 	
 	
 		now sometimes we ride and sometimes um we pull we like to to a lot of times just walk for the exercise
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i find that when i ride in a cart i play better and i think it's because i don't get as tired
 	
 	
 		i think that might be true
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't like pulling a cart on Firewheel golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path
 	
 	
 		i know and that makes me so mad i you know it's like it's not gonna do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's the reason i don't play over there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i like the course but i don't play over there because
 		you they don't uh you know don't allow you to pull a cart
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i don't think a cart damages the turf
 	
 	
 		right well the reason why we play over there is because since we're a Garland resident they give us a special deal where you can get um ten rounds of golf for
 		a hundred dollar yeah a hundred dollars because it's half price what the normal green fees are
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's why we you know play over there because we've got our card
 	
 	
 		well i guess i could use a car too i live uh very near very close to the Firewheel Golf Course
 	
 	
 		oh do you so you live in Garland then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i live in northwest Garland right up there near the golf course
 	
 	
 		okay well we're in south Garland but yeah next time you go um
 		you know check into it they've uh it's just like uh a bus card and they just punch it you know it's got
 		one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you
 	
 	
 		well in the last two years i haven't played very much golf because i'm involved in Boy Scouts
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		so i have uh i have children i have children Boy Scout age i have two boys that are Boy Scout age and so
 	
 	
 		you must have a a son
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		i'm very active in Boy Scouts so i'd have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby
 	
 	
 		yeah oh well that sounds like fun too
 	
 	
 		but i like
 		but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it's gonna probably be six to eight years before they go to college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well you need to teach them how to play take them out on the course with you
 	
 	
 		so
 		that's right lessons are expensive though
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well you can teach them
 	
 	
 		well they probably would never make it then because i don't think i only took lessons for golf when i was in college
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		ah as a course for P E you know  so i could graduate
 	
 	
 		right right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh that's the only time i think i've ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual
 	
 	
 		uh-huh right
 		right
 	
 	
 		i took one lesson one other time besides that um i just uh try to make the club hit the ball
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah i know what you mean
 	
 	
 		i don't wanna play strike out you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i have fun doing it some you know have some good shots and some bad shots
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's it's just nice to get outdoors and do something
 	
 	
 		so you said you work uh in the gardens too do you have ah special flowers
 	
 	
 		well flower gardens i like to have matter fact this past weekend i i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs
 		so those ought to be coming up around spring time
 	
 	
 		my wife had uh
 		just put in a bunch of i wanna say they're pansies
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she put them in like two months ago because they're winter plants
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they just bloom with all even with all the cold weather weather we've had they've been blooming just fine
 	
 	
 		oh they do great i put mine in probably in November
 	
 	
 		that's when she did i think
 	
 	
 		yeah i think was November and i don't do anything to mine i don't water mine or anything and they just they do really good and i even had i guess it was last year the year before i had some out
 		and it froze and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later i didn't do anything to them so they're um
 		they're they're good to plant in the winter time
 		because they last for a long time then
 		so if you start putting them you know you can put them out in the spring too but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them because they can't stand the hot weather
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do they survive longer if you put them in the winter time will they make it through the summer some
 	
 	
 		no they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot
 		but they'd make it through probably winter and spring
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 		yeah i've got some of those too i love flowers
 	
 	
 		well
 		oh that's good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i do some i try to do some arts and crafts and i love to go the to
