 		no i don't no
 	
 	
 		no huh
 	
 	
 		not that really much exposure in the in the recent past either how about yourself
 	
 	
 		no uh not a lot i've got a couple of friends that work uh as teachers or you know in in different school districts and different things but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and do you have any children
 	
 	
 		i
 		i have a daughter that's only eighteen months though so we haven't got exposed too much to that but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you can sure see where it seems like uh
 		there's a lot of concern for everything going downhill and they blame a lot of it on education i i kind of wonder i don't know if you blame the system or if you blame the kids and the parents for not studying or making the kids study hard enough or exactly what
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		i think it's probably a combination you know i think probably parents expect a lot more out of the school system than it's realistic that that the school system can provide
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		for them to get
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in conjunction a lot of um school districts' funds have been cut because of at least in California that's the case it's probably the case elsewhere too
 	
 	
 		sure
 		yeah
 		well they've been cut yeah i just it seems like more and more with uh more families having to resort to you know to two incomes and stuff there's not the time that they spend and so they like you say they expect the the schools to do more of it but hell there's only so many in hours a day
 	
 	
 		i don't even know if it's just because um people are working you know both parents are working outside the home as much as it it's a matter of
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well it's kind of a philosophical philosophical expectation about who's responsible for discipline you know it's
 	
 	
 		oh you know i think that's a good point it's really a good point
 	
 	
 		it
 		you know you you could be working full time and um still be able to work with your child and provide some guidance at home and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in terms of homework as well as the the you know discipline for what's important in terms of values and i think that's probably something that not as many kids get i mean just i guess
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i say that because you see it reflected in the society at large there are a lot of kids out there who seem more troubled today than they used to be
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i uh you know it seems like i remember on school nights you know i was never outside past eight you know maybe nine o'clock at the very latest
 		whether i was in doing homework or not you know i may not have been but yet there was that influence in the home to where i was at least you know getting prepared for the next day or whatever and and you're you know you're right in saying you don't see a lot of that there's out running around and uh doing a lot of different things that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		maybe TV's a bigger um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		TV and Nintendo
 	
 	
 		competitor for their time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah that's probably true there's a lot more uh
 	
 	
 		and when we were kids
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true i know you know i didn't appreciate i
 		i was you know fortunate to where i could i kind of breezed through high school without too much problem stuff and and didn't really learn how to study that much until i hit college
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but boy i sure wish now that i had picked that up earlier because you know took me a couple of years in college before i really started getting the grades going and
 		you know it affects your whole life especially when you hit college if you don't you know do as well as you can it can it can follow you for quite a while so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's a good point just learning the discipline to to to study
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		to sit and study and i don't know it's it's you know i only have the the one daughter and she's quite young but it makes you a little nervous to
 		know what they have to deal with you know in the future and get prepared for them but
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		well probably having gone through that experience you'll be likely to want to speak speak with her uh teachers and really try to communicate with them to find out what it is that you can do to help her at home
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		do you have any children at all or
 	
 	
 		our daughter's two so i'm in sort of in the same boat that you are
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		same boat
 		yeah have you uh have you ever considered private schools at all or
 	
 	
 		well you know we're coming up on the time she's probably going to be ready for she's in a day care situation now because my husband and i both work full time but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think she'll probably be ready for preschool around three or three and a half and after that time we really do need to think about it because in San Francisco
 		in our neighborhood there's actually a good public schools at the elementary grade there's not a really decent middle school or high school i'm not sure we'll be in the same area when she's that old but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i have to really do the research to find out
 		whether or not the public schools stand up to the private schools and what the costs are and all that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's really the the expense is a real issue  when you think about
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true that's true yeah i i am i like a lot of the times you know i think the social aspect can be maybe as important and in a lot of ways as the education they get uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		sometimes i wonder if they can get that same thing in a in a private high school or
 	
 	
 		well i don't know how it is in your community i know that um
 	
 	
 		or not
 	
 	
 		in some communities of San Francisco the public schools well actually it's not so much in the city actually it's outside more in the east Oakland or east bay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um the public schools are so poor that the private schools have just really grown as a response to the fact that the parents don't feel that they're getting getting what they want in the public schools so they're almost like public
 	
 	
 		um-hum
