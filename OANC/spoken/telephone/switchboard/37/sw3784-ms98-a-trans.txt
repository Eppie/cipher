 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah as far as i'm concerned and
 		probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching uh Reasonable Doubts which had a you know capital case in it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh  my i personally have uh my own feelings about uh the capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony
 	
 	
 		i do too
 	
 	
 		mandatory i mean summary execution on the steps that day
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		why is it you know i i'm i'm in that same i think if it's uh
 		if it's a convicted  if it's a convicted uh felon on parole
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh and he goes out and and commits another crime or kills somebody i you know i i feel the same way i don't think i think that person is is beyond uh
 		rehabilitation and and he should be
 		taken out
 	
 	
 		well
 		i i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i do know that some people
 		almost all people usually die before that point
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they just get too old
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		as far as capital punishment on on it's own merits
 		i have the trouble with the way it's applied
 		i think it should be applied  on a little bit more fair manner
 		uh  and i've i've said this very often and i believe it to be the a a very true axiom so i would be rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because if you're  if you're black and you kill a white guy you're going to fry period they will kill you
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		if you're black and you kill a black guy you know it's you know two hundred hours of community service
 	
 	
 		yeah you don't hear you don't hear too much of that of those cases
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know we're the majority so we can do whatever the hell we wanna do
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and you're the minority and you're stuck with it
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you know we had this in the Vietnam war you know we had  you know population of blacks among military people in Vietnam was about eighty percent
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but the population of blacks in the military was about twenty two percent
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		the handwriting's on the wall there isn't it
 	
 	
 		yep it sure is
 	
 	
 		you know
 		but that's another issue altogether
 	
 	
 		yeah it's
 	
 	
 		as as far as capital punishment
 		i think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment i think the guy should have ninety days
 		and if he can't produce evidence not argument but evidence
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		see the only thing i don't you know i don't understand i guess i i don't understand our judicial system uh as it is right now because i
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		you know if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death
 		how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal
 		and get stays of execution execution i mean how you know is there
 	
 	
 		well that that goes back to when uh America was a a colony of England
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		in England you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent
 		and
 		once they found you guilty you know the judge said he's guilty kill him
 		well there there were some people that uh had a problem with that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed and he'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh or he'll have somebody lie for him you know people lie it's a strange thing but they do that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 		to prevent that kind of misuse of power
 		they wrote into the Constitution a protection against judicial mishap
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and the judicial mishap in this event would be hey you got the wrong guy look at that guy uh at E Systems
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		they were going to they convicted him
 		of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he was too far away when it happened he had witnesses that were you know they weren't dope dealers they weren't drug fiends they were employees of a
 		an establishment that had a very high level of security sensitivity and these were really responsible people
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy
 	
 	
 		
  
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know they all look the same to me you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		big lips flat nose yep that was him
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yep
 		what do you think about um uh
 		convicted um
