 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well Tom what do you think about our public school systems today
 	
 	
 		um well i have i have two kids in school and
 		and in comparing it with people who live in other parts of the world one of the things that things wrong is that our our schools our kids seem to go to school less
 		of of the year than than kids in other countries
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um it seems like uh the long summer break is something that
 		only
 		uh only occurs in the United States
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um do you have any kids in school
 	
 	
 		no i don't
 		so i'm a little bit out of it i can look back to my  to when i was in school which is getting further and further away and also i have a niece and nephew that are in school out in California and i hear a little a bit about from my sister about
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		things going on yeah
 	
 	
 		well some of the some of the uh schools are trying to go to more of a year around system
 	
 	
 		yeah they're moving to that out there
 	
 	
 		and uh i guess there's pros and cons to that too i know if if if it happened here i would hope that uh you know i have uh two children that are two years a part i would just hope they were in the same system so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if you wanna take a vacation you could
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i hear that they that in at least in the system that's going out um  in California where that i'm familiar with that they do put families on the same schedule
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so seems like that could get a little difficult to do that but
 	
 	
 		it could it could one of the other um things is that um
 		uh there's been a lot of talk about uh American schools uh getting behind in science compared to uh lot of European schools and and Japan also
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that their schools are teaching uh more of the science sciences and putting out better
 		uh graduates when in math and science uh for the future you know technology in various countries
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's not a favorite subject for either of my my kids it's probably not
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for anyone but it just seems like uh those are the criticisms criticisms you hear over and over about the the the American public school system and this is probably why a lot people  go to private schools instead
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah well i hadn't thought about those things but those are problems um
 	
 	
 		some of the some of the  people that i work with uh they're they're some from various parts of the of the world and and uh course everybody likes to think their system's the best but the the ones in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		England and and then Germany seem seem to uh have some logical points about
 		you know why do why do kids need a three month break in the summer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i i think that dates back to
 		when America was agricultural and nature and and children needed to help on farms and it's been quite a while since that's been the case for most part now
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		yeah there's no need for it anymore
 	
 	
 		and it seems though that's one of the things that ought to to change
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i'm not i'm not that happy to always be uh limited to just summers for most vacations and
 		and uh Christmas time for the other you know the other one
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and compete with all the crowds since all the other people with uh families going on vacation
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		tends to make some crowds
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		did you go through the public school system
 	
 	
 		yeah i did
 	
 	
 		uh uh uh yeah i did too and everyone else in  my family but seems like uh
 		uh if people can afford it the number of people go the private school route but that's of course not available to to the average person with
 	
 	
 		right i know a lot of people that are home schooling their children you know just teaching them at home and
 	
 	
 		yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and for lots of different reasons you know
 	
 	
 		that i have mixed feelings about that too i guess whether or not they miss the social interaction a part of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i know that a lot of them um they hook up with like a home schooling system and they get together the kids get together for lots of activities and outings and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		yeah that that would help
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that helps yeah i wonder too i have mixed feelings about it but um
 		i know that uh you know i spot when i thought of problems in the school system it's not really the fault of the school system but there's a lot of
 		you know it's just uh
 		
 
 		i don't know kids are exposed to a lot that you can't shelter them eventually eventually but it's hard at a young age some of the pressures and
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 		yeah the i i think that's why a lot of people go to the home schooling they they disagree with what they're exposed to either for religious reasons or or other reasons
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		the other thing that's happening now i guess is is
 	
 	
 		yeah
