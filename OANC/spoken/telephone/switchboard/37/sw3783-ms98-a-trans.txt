 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh personal computer i don't have a personal computer i'd like to have one if i had more money i'd have one
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  i've got one
 		i do have one but it's a kind of an old one that uh they didn't use at work any longer it's not the  not the greatest one but uh i use one at work quite a bit all day long in fact
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		is it is it hard to find uh compatible pieces for your the one you have at home
 	
 	
 		yeah because it's a little bit older  and uh  it's a it's a Wang machine and Wang was you know a leader a while ago but now they're kind of out of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		yeah
 		um i would think that would be the hardest part about having a home computer is the it seems like every month  they're coming out with something new and so then you're not compatible oh yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what's that
 		oh yeah constantly constantly changing
 	
 	
 		uh even with like the computer games Nintendo and that kind of stuff i mean they change it every year and the the previous game or the previous program or whatever isn't compatible
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		most of the uh  you know WordPerfect and Lotus and those kinds of programs you can subscribe to an update service for about fifty dollars a year i think they'll give you the the next release of their software
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and but uh
 	
 	
 		well that isn't that doesn't sound too bad
 	
 	
 		yeah do you use one much
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um not really not in my work um i did try and take a class um i think last was it last spring
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		no actually it was last fall it was at at i took desktop publishing i just wanted to get sort of a a slight feel for it and it was just an introduction course
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		sure uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it was pretty fascinating we we learned how to do how to make a brochure type thing out out off off the computer so it was pretty interesting
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah  oh i'm a CPA and i use it almost all the time for this Lotus program i'll have  well lot of good applications for what i have to do
 	
 	
 		oh so you've yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		now the Lotus is for mostly numbers and graphs and things like that right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah or uh spreadsheets and that type of thing yeah it's
 	
 	
 		i'm not real good with computers at all and that's mainly because i don't use them i wish i did i'd be you know
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		more up on it
 	
 	
 		well they they've sure come down in price uh in your you know four or five years ago they were  probably four or five times what they are now
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness yes
 		yeah
 		have you heard about the phone that uh believe it's AT and T
 		uh is it AT and T that's coming out with the phone with the like on the Jetsons when you could see the you could see the person's face
 	
 	
 		oh yeah uh-huh when you have a vision with the sound  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		have you seen that yeah
 		yeah yeah i saw that in a in a magazine recently i was really shocked yeah
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure i'd like that once you get those calls early in the morning when you're just out of bed
 	
 	
 		oh i know  hopefully you can
 	
 	
 		decide if you wanna have a picture or not  yeah
 	
 	
 		have control over whether they can see you or not
 		but it looked pretty nice and it's only gonna be two thousand dollars so which is not bad for something new like that so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		well you know they've got these uh  all these modems uh computers have modems in them now where you can call all over the face uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i can do a fair amount of work from home and tap into our company's main computer system without much trouble
 	
 	
 		oh
 		my mother does a lot of work on computers and she taps into computers all over the world she works at at she works at TI and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh this is uh how you got signed up for it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh and uh you know she talks to people through the computer from everywhere so i think i think that's really neat too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well i have a sister lives in Plano that's my connection with the project
 	
 	
 		okay uh-huh
 		maybe she knows my mother because my mother used to work in Plano now she works in uh north Dallas i think so
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but i you know there are  i've got a six year old and i think he's
 		he's got quite a bit of interest in uh in playing around with the one we have at home and it's not a  it's not a real fun one it's not a color or i don't have much in the way of game software
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i visited with some kids in elementary school and nowadays a lot of the schools have computers and the kids are really they're more interested in their schoolwork
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		with the computer you know they can also play games but then they can help them write papers and helps with their math and that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		yeah  i think it
 		yeah  you know adds a dimension that uh probably makes learning a little bit more fun if you get to you know
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		try things a little different than just the standard pencil and paper and crayons
 	
 	
 		and there's always something new even if you know even if you think you know everything about the computer there's always one button
 		that you never quite use and you don't really know what it's for and you know it can be fascinating in that way too especially for a kid that you know is just learning so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well hopefully i'll be able to get a computer at some point i don't know when but i don't need one right now
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but there's gonna come a time i'm sure when everybody's gonna have to have one
 	
 	
 		oh i think that day'll happen i'm hoping and perhaps uh what'll ultimately happen is you won't have to commute as much  but you'll be able to do so much from home
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that uh you know you won't have to be driving around like
