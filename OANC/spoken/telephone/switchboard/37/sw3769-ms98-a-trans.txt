 
     		
 	
 		okay it's pressed are you still there okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm ready
 	
 	
 		so what's uh things that you look for when you go out to dinner
 	
 	
 		oh i just like a nice quiet nice atmosphere
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and of course good food that's always that's always a concern but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something
 	
 	
 		um
 		um that sounds pretty
 	
 	
 		just to relax you know because i don't really go out to dinner that much so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum well we don't go out to dinner that much either we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um i've been to some that's been terrible you know you see cockroaches crawling around and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		everything you know but i try to get one that's nice and clean and then i like to you know good food and good service
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah where you don't feel rushed you know and you can just relax and stay as long as you want and
 	
 	
 		yeah right right right
 		so is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano
 	
 	
 		well nearby we're almost in Dallas we're just north of Dallas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so we have quite a bit between us and there it's about ten miles
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and there is all kinds of restaurants and
 		i had one that was a favorite for a long time and then it changed hands and doubled the prices and then it finally went out of business
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so but it was really nice it had a fireplace and
 	
 	
 		um that sounds beautiful
 	
 	
 		yeah it was really nice they had entertainment sometimes and you you could just really relax there and enjoy it
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum well  this is only a little small city um we have uh
 	
 	
 		but it's gone
 	
 	
 		excuse me
 		i didn't think my coughing would come back
 		anyhow we have only like one uh
 		restaurant that's kind of nice you know they have prime rib on uh weekends
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then then they have about six miles from here is called a little city called Wesley
 		and they have a Wesley Hotel there that they serve food and the atmosphere there is really really nice
 	
 	
 		oh that's nice
 	
 	
 		so and then if we really want to you know something different then we go to Modesto which is like twenty minutes away
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh we don't have any fast foods here in this small city
 	
 	
 		that's probably very fortunate for you do you have kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do i have kids well i have a son but he's grown up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh because i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night you know and now she's graduated to two cheeseburgers so something's happened here but but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know McDonald's is definitely at the top of her list and i hate these places
 	
 	
 		yeah all the kids seem to love McDonald's don't they you know
 	
 	
 		so uh-huh they do and i don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in  anything they have so
 	
 	
 		no no i'm sure there isn't
 	
 	
 		so we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around and it's really it's tempting when you come home from work and you're tired and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know you just are tempted to give in to that and it costs a lot of money to do it too you know it adds up and it's not healthy and
 	
 	
 		i know it's
 	
 	
 		i i really got into that habit for a while but i got out of it again because i just felt like it was just too unhealthy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well let's see what else can we talk about
 	
 	
 		well how's California today
 	
 	
 		oh it's foggy and cold here
 	
 	
 		is it that's what i've heard yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum yeah it's
 	
 	
 		yeah have you always lived there
 	
 	
 		i came from Iowa when i was sixteen
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i've lived out in California for a long long time yeah i like it real well
 	
 	
 		and you like it
 		yeah we've been
 	
 	
 		we used to live in Oakland so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know but uh then i quit work and everything and i moved bought a house i had a condo in Oakland so right in Chinatown so we went to a lots of restaurants and Chinese restaurants
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh that would be fun
 	
 	
 		and they were really good i really miss them
 	
 	
 		yeah do you miss living there
 	
 	
 		you know
 		uh no i really don't miss living there i just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese dinner once in a while you know
 	
 	
 		no
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but um as far as missing living there no it's close enough if i wanted to go there to San Francisco for dinner or something why you know
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know have dinner and then come on back but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		have you ever been to California
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i i go all the time
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah well i have a twenty one year old daughter in college there and she um is world champion twirler
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum

 		um
 	
 	
 		so i went out a lot with her
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah i know California pretty well and i love it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i guess
 	
 	
 		and we tug back and forth who's gonna move
