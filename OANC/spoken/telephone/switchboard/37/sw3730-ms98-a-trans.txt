 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		child care or
 	
 	
 		uh no actually i'm still single
 	
 	
 		are you
 	
 	
 		yeah but my mom uh she teaches at a uh child care center
 	
 	
 		oh does she what
 	
 	
 		yeah uh you've heard of Kinder Care
 	
 	
 		yeah i have
 	
 	
 		yeah it's a big chain she uh she teaches up in uh up in the Washington area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		matter of fact it's a pretty big business
 	
 	
 		yeah it is my wife teaches is teaches at this uh little small family owned one here in Utah but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know what do you think about it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		do they have a lot of those up in Utah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh they do actually there's quite a few and getting more and more seems like
 	
 	
 		yeah they're they're growing really really fast i remember uh i i worked with a bunch of people uh uh for the summer and she was trying and one of the ladies there who drove me there she was trying to put her daughter in child care and it was the the competition is pretty fierce you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh some places uh charge a lot of money and offer all sorts of amenities
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		some places are like really cheap but uh you know they like have a it's like a home or something an old home they just hire a bunch of people and have a big yard and let the kids play back there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		play all day
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 	
 	
 		so what was she looking for when she was out around
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well she was um she was looking for something cheap obviously uh someone to take care of her kid but that at the same time she didn't want you know some people that were like a bunch of teenagers you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just out there working because some people do that they'll just go to high school or something get some kids who work for five dollars an hour and get them out there and that's all they really care about you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh some places like uh they have uh they set up a gym you know like a jungle gym and uh they they emphasize like athletics and stuff like that but those kinds of places get pretty expensive and it's really for the yuppies
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		well my wife i mean they they have a prepared you know little school school type lessons for them and stuff but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but the kids sometimes are so rowdy and want to be outside that that stuff doesn't go over too well she
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she's not too set on the whole thing i mean it's a job for her she has to take it but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh she's not too she'd rather almost just get a somebody she knows you know personally and have them babysit her you know her kids
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah my uh that's that's what uh what my mom you know thinks is the best way to do it you know if you know someone uh who's willing to take care of the person who's willing to take care of the kids that that uh you know that you can trust
 	
 	
 		if she had to
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's probably the best way to do it because sometimes you know i i don't know if you saw the thing on uh some news i think on ABC one time they was showing how people the some of the people were just smacking the kids around you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah her
 		yeah well that was and that was what really kind kind of scared us is because well we we have a daughter and she goes with her but she's in a different class and my wife will poke her head downstairs and she'll see the lady screaming at the kids and stuff and i'm just going wait a minute you know i mean
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		she's a year and half you you know eighteen months old
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		you can't be screaming at them too much but
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		it seems uh i don't know i was pretty
 		i'm not i i don't like them i think
 	
 	
 		how many kids do you have
 	
 	
 		we just have one just a little daughter eighteen months and
 	
 	
 		just one
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i said i it's the only reason you know she the only reason we have my wife working is that she can work with her she can go to work with her otherwise it's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		is it expensive up there
 	
 	
 		well we i think they usually charge about twelve bucks a day so i think we're pretty cheap i heard once that like out in Boston it could be upwards of four hundred dollars a month and here you and yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it it can get real expensive i remember i worked at a place in Washington called Intelsat
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh the building also house WJLA and they had a it was the child care facility was on one of the floors in the building
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they would charge i think the rate was eight hundred dollars a month for child care but the convenience was that the kid was in the same building as you were and it was a and
 	
 	
 		gee
 		yeah
 		but you know the kind of money you have to make to make that even worthwhile i mean you know to pay eight hundred bucks out of your income
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  oh yeah
 		oh yeah but uh the the child care facility was really top notch they had uh the where the kids were was i mean the right above it was an executive uh room for the WJLA right below it was an executive room for WJLA and it's all glass
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		so i mean there's really nothing they couldn't do they could do that uh you know that nobody could see you know so everything was pretty much under uh you know uh supervision
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and since uh the building was built on a park on park land they had plenty of land to go out and just play around if they wanted to and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i like the idea of having it on site something like that i think that's
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i mean you can go visit your kids during the day you know and see see how they're doing
 	
 	
 		yeah go have lunch with them and stuff like that but that sounds pretty cool
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		but anyway well i think we got our three minutes
 	
 	
 		yeah hey well it's been good talking to you
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hey it was a pleasure talking to you too take care bye bye
 	
 	
 		all right see you later bye bye
