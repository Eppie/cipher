 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		do you know about the space program
 	
 	
 		well actually at this point my understanding of the space program is a little on the limited side um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i think they keep it that way purposely
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's to an extent that's understandable
 	
 	
 		yeah it's gonna take uh i think it's gonna take a long time before they uh get that space colony out there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they uh i remember uh six five six years ago they showed on uh one of the scientific channels you know not Discovery but one of those old ones
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they had some professor on there who was uh building a it was like a it was kind of like a space station but it was supposed to be for people you know and uh experimental stages
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's supposed to be about ten miles long
 	
 	
 		oh it's supposed to be more of a colony than a than a research lab
 	
 	
 		right right well they they were all gonna be research scientists out there and they were just gonna build it up and make it bigger and bigger
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and but the initial stage was supposed to be about ten miles long which is i mean huge for i guess for space
 	
 	
 		yeah like a central unit and then everything else kind of rotating out from that
 	
 	
 		um
 		no it was more like one big long thing it wasn't uh anything circular i've seen a circular pattern too uh  but i don't know if uh you know how far along they went with the circular pattern
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh like i say this was a long time ago and uh they this is one big long one that they had planned on and they had thought out how they were gonna uh regenerate the air with plants and stuff and they had a
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		they they had thought that out or hadn't
 	
 	
 		no they had they had thought out they had thought it out only the only thing was it was really really expensive and it was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		not if you got to think about it was five or six years they said you know by nineteen ninety seven or nineteen ninety eight we would actually be able to uh to start launching this thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they'd have to take several projects to go up there before and add on piece by piece
 	
 	
 		yeah so it was all modular like you send up a small section it'd be liveable for a couple of people and they send up another section and bolt it on and
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		right and then they've and once it got big enough they would send more people up once it got established and they got all the systems working
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah well that sort of thing could work um
 	
 	
 		yeah pretty fascinating
 	
 	
 		what did they did did was there any indication what they're going do about uh gravity
 	
 	
 		no it was pretty it was no it was a it was a gravity free environment they uh they had shown they had shown like at some sort of uh simulation on how it would be up there and they showed people floating around so uh
 	
 	
 		or were they just gonna let you bob around
 		hm
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		at at the point i don't think there was any kind of uh you know gravity control whatsoever
 	
 	
 		now what what they've started figuring out lately is that gravity or some form of it makes it a whole lot easier to stay up there for long periods
 	
 	
 		uh-huh hm
 	
 	
 		some of the uh i i've heard little bits of stuff about some of their things they found out about that was was it one and a half year stay some Soviet cosmonauts spent up in space
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they had some problems digestive tract problems and uh uh minor circulatory uh little problems but they could eventually become pretty big problems or if people people with with problems to start with that weren't really noticed yet
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah i can see that
 		oh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they they could generate into big problems um
 	
 	
 		hm
 		no uh these these people definitely didn't look into any kind of stuff like that they were just talking about the space station itself and how were they gonna put it up there and spend all this money they uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's why a lot of the um designs for space stations have been circular
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so they can get them spinning centrifugal force comes close enough to uh uh simulating gravity that there's very little problem with uh uh gravityless uh side effects
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know i don't know if you saw it was it two thousand and one that uh that double wheel arrangement
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah uh-huh
 		right right right
 	
 	
 		that's uh one of the more popular theories
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		they also have them where you got a long central cylinder kind of like a like a cross connection tube and a lot of pods sticking out from that central core kind of like a big pine cone like deal
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		or a bottle brush almost where the pods are all rotating in enough of a a
 	
 	
 		hm hm
 	
 	
 		a rotation speed so that the centrifugal force pretty much is one uh is is equal to earth gravity
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's pretty neat hm then i would i'd mean it makes sense you know i never had thought about it you ever see the uh the EPCOT Center
 	
 	
 		no no i've not
 	
 	
 		the uh at the EPCOT Center in in uh i think it's the the AT and T display they show a a bunch of uh future space pods and what life would be like out in space
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's pretty neat i still think it's a long ways away though
 	
 	
 		well actually it needs to be put off for a little while for now just because there's so much money going into it that would be a whole lot better spent on on local problems
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		um the health care and and uh law enforcement uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah and and i tell you the  you know it's expensive
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		just just i mean space programs themselves you know i uh i work in the uh in the satellite telecommunication business and putting up satellites is ridiculous expensive and these things are unmanned just a bunch of electronics we shoot out in space you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		uh the bulk of them probably have aren't even pressurized
 	
 	
 		uh no no
