 
     		
 	
 		have a favorite for the Super Bowl or i guess being as all the rest the teams are eliminated that's about all we can talk about
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah right uh well i i think um uh oh
 		i probably um i don't know watching my son's a big fan of uh of Washington
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so uh for  not not having any other real real preference i guess
 	
 	
 		yes go for that well that's who i kind of thought uh that's who i was gonna kind of cheer for i just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		think all the teams from the AFC are more or less like the minor leagues for  the NFC lately so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i just i hope they can give them a game i think it'll be a good game this year but
 		i don't know in the past they haven't been so hot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's kind of kind of bad when they get blown out like
 	
 	
 		do you uh
 		yeah gets you know you you watch the Super Bowl for the commercials and that's about it all the new ones that come out so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		just out of curiosity what uh people up in Utah um who who do who do people generally cheer for who are who are the close teams out there the California teams
 	
 	
 		well i i think a lot of them uh uh kind of like me i i cheer i like players you know certain players and so i root for those teams and Brigham Young University of course is pretty big up here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum sure
 	
 	
 		and so a lot of people like the 49ers because Steve Young plays for them uh Jim McMahon plays for the Chicago Bears so they cheered for him you know when he played for them but he kind of got to be a jerk so nobody liked him anyway but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh a lot of 49ers i think uh more than anything i guess but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 		yeah i mean in in Texas there's there's plenty you know there's a fair amount to choose from between the Cowboys and and the Oilers and so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		yeah we i i've always been kind of a Cowboys fan i like them i'm glad to see they're doing a little bit better but i see i just usually root for players that i know of i guess and whatever happens happens so
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		um-hum
 		used to be the Cowboys i mean the Cowboys for for for so many years uh ended up
 		essentially dominating or  and and being so strong consistently and then the last few years  being being just walked all over  by everybody i mean they've they've lost a lot of fans
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh
 		oh yeah well i think i think you'll see i bet in the nineties they come out and i'll bet they're the team to beat is i mean they got so many first and second round picks again this year that i think they're gonna be really tough and Jimmy Johnson
 	
 	
 		i yeah yeah
 		sure
 		yeah they're they're obviously rebuilding quite pretty well and and stuff
 	
 	
 		oh yeah that Jimmy Johnson seems to know what he's doing too are you
 	
 	
 		yeah i i didn't know how he was gonna make the transition into professional ball um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it's one thing to be a real successful college coach now i i at least i imagine it is um you know and and then
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it seem like it would be quite different to to be coaching pros
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well you'd think that the just the personalities the people it it it would seem a lot harder to get them motivated i mean it's a job then and you know you're not out for school spirit or whatever you know you're out for the fifty grand
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		course course also at that at that level i mean you're dealing with people who who who know you know who who are competitive obviously or they wouldn't be there and they're motivated obviously or they wouldn't be there you know
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		yeah that's true i guess
 	
 	
 		and so uh you know i don't know i mean but it seems like it would you know you can't treat them like they're kids and yet  in a lot of senses still a lot of them probably are
 	
 	
 		course i've always had a hard time screaming at somebody that was about six five and two fifty anyway so i always thought that was kind of stupid  wouldn't yell too loud at them because you never know what might come back at you
 	
 	
 		yeah you would've you would've been one of those coaches with the soft styles  yeah
 	
 	
 		that's right  just sweet talk them as much as you can because
 	
 	
 		my yeah my dad was actually a football coach so yeah in the junior junior college yeah
 	
 	
 		oh was he on a college level or junior college oh so did you play at all yourself or
 	
 	
 		i played played high school but i didn't didn't go beyond that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i stopped growing i think about when i was twelve years old and everybody else grew up so i quit after Little League because i realized it was
 	
 	
 		yeah huh
 	
 	
 		i was gonna get pounded on if i kept going so
 	
 	
 		uh  well i'm i didn't grow too big myself but
 	
 	
 		yep but do you follow college much at all either or
 	
 	
 		a little bit more so yeah because i i'm here in Austin and we have uh UT Austin it's here and and uh
 	
 	
 		do you
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know they they look like they were big you know they're kind of like the Cowboys i mean  for years years had a dominating team then they went through this big long  slump and and uh last year it looked like they were back and and there was predictions that they were gonna be a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it'll be real challenge in fact i think they started ranks like you know fifteenth in the polls or something and then you know then it was a long slide down it really was it a fairly disappointing year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh really
 		yeah
 		well i you know what they're i mean football in Texas that's pretty uh it's uh like a rabid thing down there isn't it
 	
 	
 		it yeah it's it's pretty serious uh you know i i end up being so busy that i i don't watch much of it and and i don't follow it much but it's obvious that the people around me do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and and i sometimes feel bad that i haven't you know i'm not up on it more
 	
 	
 		yeah in fact that's that was our whole reason for cheering this year because that uh Ty Detmer was from Texas down there and that's that's who i follow quite a bit is BYU but
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so we were kind of prejudiced towards him good or bad or whatever anybody thinks but yeah they seem that he just from what he was saying his dad was a coach his brother was into it i mean that just seemed like a lot of people were involved kind of like Indiana and basketball or something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		right and and supposedly uh uh his brother his younger brother is graduating supposedly his younger brother is supposed to be a lot better than he is yeah
 	
 	
 		oh really that'll be interesting see i know uh he's he been recruited pretty heavily he's not sure if he wants to f ollow in his brother's footsteps and go to the Y i wouldn't do it if i were him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no i don't know  Texas
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		boy if he doesn't live up to that at least his brother's expectations
