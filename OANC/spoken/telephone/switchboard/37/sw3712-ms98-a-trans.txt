 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i don't really like um
 		rap
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i like classical jazz um you know um
 		contemporary i don't know  what you call it i guess light rock or easy listening or whatever what about you
 	
 	
 		um-hum  um a lot the same i don't like hard rock at all and i uh don't like um
 		rap either i don't care too much for jazz sometimes i  do a few things i have heard that i like but
 	
 	
 		hang on excuse me  Rusty no
 		my dog's getting in the trash okay go ahead
 	
 	
 		okay
 		and um i like classical and i like um
 		a lot of different kinds of contemporary um folksy type where you can hear the words and um you know where there are something they're saying
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um i guess my preference is um well either classical or Christian contemporary or uh praise type songs
 	
 	
 		and who who in the Christian contemporary do you like to listen to
 	
 	
 		um i don't have a particular favorite i um
 		i like some of the music that's put out by Hosannah um Integrity tapes they're instrumental mostly um where they just have um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		praise songs and it's set to just instruments or um praise songs with words um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's a few things i don't pay too much attention i turn the radio on and i don't always pay attention to who is singing what i just know there's a song here a song there i like i don't spend a lot of money buying tapes and stuff so
 	
 	
 		i don't either unless i know that i like uh you know a lot of the music on a particular cassette
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i do uh my husband's from Latin America and uh so i listen to Salsa which is typical of where he's from and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it it's a really lively fun music you'll you'll find yourself just moving just listening to it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's fun but mostly i'll listen to uh
 		i guess i listen to easy listening in the car but if i am at home i'll listen to i don't know if if not jazz you know it'll be some type of uh
 		like i was talking about you know the music from his area or um i like gospel music i listen to a lot of i like a cappella gospel
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum yeah i do too
 	
 	
 		there's a group called Take Six that that does some really lovely stuff i mean some of it is a little too um
 		it's too i mean it it's it's too much along the lines of of a lot of black music it's too uh it's not rap but it's just not enough gospel for me but their first um works that came out i really enjoyed them
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 		um-hum have your ever heard of John Michael Talbot
 	
 	
 		yeah i have heard of him the name rings familiar i don't know why though
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i guess i he's one that at least i know you know if i hear his name i'll probably like it cause i he just has a real
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		quiet reflective i think he just accompanies himself on the guitar and uh classical guitar and i really like classical guitar yeah
 	
 	
 		hm well that sounds nice
