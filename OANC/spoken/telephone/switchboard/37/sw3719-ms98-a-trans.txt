 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what do you think
 	
 	
 		something wrong with our school systems yes
 	
 	
 		right um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		nobody wants to go to public schools  um
 	
 	
 		yeah the class sizes are too large and  they don't pay the teachers enough
 		like in Dallas they have too many administrators they're top-heavy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh they had yesterday on the news they had some problems with the
 		the text
 		having um mistakes in them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh a lot of them aren't like the history books aren't historically correct they they covered up a lot of the bad things that have happened
 	
 	
 		just what do you think can be done about that
 	
 	
 		well i think they need to
 		do whatever they can like um i think
 		um Massachusetts put a priority on education and and um
 		bringing in industry and  recruiting
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and they made a lot of difference in that state and in Texas i think we're like twenty ninth in spending
 		you know and they put through this Robin Hood bill but it doesn't change the amount of spending overall it just distributes the money more evenly
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and so that they need to do that they need to increase spending they need to um make it so that the teachers want to stay in teaching because most of the time the teachers spend
 		disciplining the the kids instead of instead of teaching the subject now
 	
 	
 		i agree
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i've got a friend who's uh a very talented teacher and has given it up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh in Carrollton uh just because it's not i mean she just can't stand the paper work um
 		you know it's uh
 		and she's not paid enough she gets more as a filing claims for an insurance company which she's not even trained to do
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 		i think it's real discouraging
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and uh i i think they changed the way the ladder is now that it takes  a longer time for for you to qualify for a higher salary and uh it's it's um
 		it's more subjective than it was before
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 		i don't know you know i don't know what incentive a teacher has to stay in teaching
 	
 	
 		i don't either
 		well do you have children
 	
 	
 		i just have uh one daughter she's six now she's going to Richardson Public Schools
 	
 	
 		out of the Dallas School District
 		basically
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't have any but if i did i don't know that i could i would want them to be in a Dallas School District
 	
 	
 		right but the worst school districts are Dallas Garland Carrollton
 		um Coppell really doesn't matter much it's it's is not at the bottom and the best is uh Highland Park Richardson and Plano
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		how old is your daughter
 	
 	
 		she's six
 	
 	
 		so she's just started this year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and you know and she's learning to read so and she can do a little bit of math now so
 	
 	
 		where are you speaking from i can hear a lot of background noise
 	
 	
 		oh uh Valley View Mall
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah there's supposed to all all the calls are supposed to be from a different phone so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's where i am and they have a lot of pay phones here so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		wow that is funny
 	
 	
 		you know
 		and i and i don't know uh uh they cut back on the since Mark White passed that bill about
 	
 	
 		well
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		cutting back on all the extracurricular activities that may have improved a little bit
 		because um
 		i was talking to a lady the other day and that that's the first thing she said her her both her children were in band and they'd quit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she said the band teacher acted like band was the only subject that he was taking and he was suppose to spend spend all of his time on band
 	
 	
 		and demanded the children right
 	
 	
 		right and he he was taking honors classes in all his other subjects he goes to the Lewisville School District
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know it's just ridiculous so he just quit simple as that
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		everything should be equal you know and there's no reason you already spend all that time in band there's no reason that he should practice more than an hour a day outside of band if he if he even has the energy especially in marching season
 	
 	
 		well that goes along with football though too you know it uh
 	
 	
 		you know
 		right and and what do you do when you are taking calculus and uh chemistry and physics two and
