 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i subscribe to a few magazines on a regular basis how about you
 	
 	
 		oh yes i do um i always enter those things that come through the mail you know  that's right yeah  yeah they do
 	
 	
 		oh really  they like you
 	
 	
 		so i have just about everything  at sometime or other
 	
 	
 		really how many how many uh would you say at any given time you tend to subscribe to
 	
 	
 		oh probably no more than say five at the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh what are your favorites
 	
 	
 		well i like uh McCalls Reader's
 	
 	
 		we subscribe to that one now too
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh Reader's Digest Redbook um Good uh let's see Good Housekeeping Better Homes and Gardens  um and uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		do you like that one
 		i had i had started that one about a year ago thinking that it would be a nice way to get some decorating tips and and more interior kinds of things but um
 		it's really a collection of everything it has got a lot of um
 		home making kinds of things too you know food as well as indoor and outdoor stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i i love to get recipes you know out of the magazine i cut them out put them in a book and  yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		yeah uh-huh  me too  i'm not sure that i use them as often as i think that i will but i sure uh pay attention to them and cut them out
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh i also um usually get a magazine about travel and um
 	
 	
 		do you use the tips and a suggestions do you do you travel often enough that you are able to to  take advantage of it
 	
 	
 		not not really  um uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		just fun just sort of
 	
 	
 		i i read them and you know get ideas but um i don't  travel that much
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so but i
 	
 	
 		the thing i like about magazines is that they are a wonderful diversion for a brief period of time if you feel like you are not in the mood  to really sit down with a book for a long time it's it's a perfect short
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 		attention getter
 	
 	
 		yes it really is yeah and um oh i like the uh beauty tips and you know all that fashion stuff and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh do you do you have favorite fashion oriented magazines
 	
 	
 		no not really  i i just read them a from the magazines that i get i don't really take a fashion magazine or anything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh uh-huh none that are specifically focused on fashion
 	
 	
 		oh no just just what's in the regular magazines
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i have a friend who works for a magazine that's based in France called Elle
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		and and i remember seeing it enough times at her house that
 		i wondered how often people subscribe to those kinds of magazines because you almost have to be in the business to be as intrigued with some of those fashions they're so bizarre
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true  it's
 	
 	
 		we all have to change our wardrobe regularly enough to invest in the magazine
 	
 	
 		that's uh that's right you sure would  oh yeah i you know keep entering these contests taking all of these magazines thinking i'll win that big
 	
 	
 		Publisher's Clearing House
 	
 	
 		yeah right  oh and there's several others that uh i get through the mail and uh you know they have contests like that not as big as that one but
 		anyway i've always been kind of a sucker i guess for magazines
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's sort of another uh added attraction of those uh contests i guess you could probably enter the contests without getting the magazines but it's not much fun
 	
 	
 		yeah you can yeah that's true  um Redbook i've always taken Redbook for years and years and years they used to have a novel in the back
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah but they quit doing that and i sure miss it
 	
 	
 		hm i don't know Redbook very well what what does it tend to be a mix of uh fashion and and recipes and that sort of thing or what what did
 	
 	
 		yeah it's similar to like McCalls or something like that yeah
 	
 	
 		oh is it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah not too much different
 	
 	
 		
 
 		tend to focus more on women's issues than
 	
 	
 		yes definitely uh-huh yeah  but they have some good short stories too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh but i really miss that novel it used to make to take me oh say a Sunday afternoon you know i'd crawl up on the couch with my Redbook and read the novel
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's interesting i always thought that that was a big enough attraction in a lot of magazines that they i'm surprised that they would get rid of it
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't know why they did i never did hear anything at all about it all of a sudden it was just gone
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum  McCalls certainly has changed a lot of over the years
 	
 	
 		yeah they used to be a big magazine and you know they cut the size down and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		all but uh
 	
 	
 		i used to get one called Savvy that went out of business or merged or something and
 		since i had only half the subscription through they automatically switched all their readers
 		instead of Savvy got McCalls and that's how i got introduced to it
 	
 	
 		oh is that right  well i can remember yeah seeing Savvy i don't know that i ever subscribed to it but i've seen it you know in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i liked it i thought it was kind of a nice
