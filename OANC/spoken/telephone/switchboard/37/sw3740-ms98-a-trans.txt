 
     		
 	
 		um i would take it that you probably read quite a bit if you picked this category
 	
 	
 		okay
 		yeah well i picked every almost every category well they said you well they said pick fifteen categories and there wasn't really all that much i was into i mean i'm interest interest of course i do read a lot but that's uh
 	
 	
 		oh you'll talk about anything right
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i i also picked gardening and  i mean i tried to talk about that for five minutes i don't really garden very much  but books i could talk about you know forever i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh me too what kind of books do you read
 	
 	
 		well mostly fiction and um i i the nonfiction i like are are the usually the crime stories
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		see and um
 	
 	
 		we're gonna get along well  well i like fiction uh matter of fact well my favorite would be horror type stories such as Stephen King and such
 	
 	
 		oh you too
 		oh see now i don't like i don't like those types i i can't relate to stuff like that it's so weird you know it's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that that's why i read it because i don't have to relate to it
 	
 	
 		i
 		yeah well i like uh i i like a book i could
 		in some way relate to and and that's i don't know it's so off the wall most of that stuff you know you really i you can't really believe it i mean you it's hard to to to read it and and really think that this could really happen it's it's i don't know it's not
 		believable to me at all
 	
 	
 		well thank goodness  believe me
 	
 	
 		well well that's true i mean you don't have to read a book and believe that you know stuff can happen but i don't know i guess i just go more for realism
 	
 	
 		
 
 		have you read The Firm
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's very good
 	
 	
 		oh that was one of the best books i've read for a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that was good i read that oh quite a while ago
 	
 	
 		and um see another one i just read that i thought was really excellent was uh Jurassic Park
 	
 	
 		oh by um oh  Crichton right Crichton now now what is that about is that uh an espionage thing
 	
 	
 		Michael Crichton or something like that have you read that one
 		no it's about um this multimillionaire that has decided that he wants to start a theme park and it's about dinosaurs
 		well they've taken DNA material from dinosaurs and and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		really recreated dinosaurs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and well it's a little far fetched also but um it was really an excellent book it held my interest have you read any of his other things
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yes i have but i  Terminal Man was that was that one of his
 	
 	
 		Terminal Man yeah i've seen seems like i've seen the movie
 	
 	
 		he he writes stuff his writing books are similar to Robin Cook's have you read any Robin Cook
 	
 	
 		i've read a couple of Robin Cook's
 	
 	
 		yeah and they're sort of similar you know the in the you know he deals a lot in you know scientific stuff or you know stuff that um
 		you don't know whether could it could happen or not you know it's just um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know but i mean most of it is good i uh haven't uh i haven't read anything by him in a long time
 	
 	
 		well i noticed he had a couple i don't know how recent they are but i think Sphere was one and something else uh another one word title and i thought i might pick up one of those books because
 	
 	
 		Fear is that what you said Fear
 	
 	
 		Sphere S P H E R E
 	
 	
 		oh oh no i don't know i'm not familiar with that no
 	
 	
 		well how about did you read Silence of the Lambs
 	
 	
 		oh oh yes  oh yes you did you read his other one The Red Dragon yes now uh both of them were terrific
 	
 	
 		yes i did
 		they were uh Silence of the Lambs though was i i could not put the book down i
 	
 	
 		well see now i couldn't either now i uh a friend of mine started to read it because you know i told her it's terrific and everybody she'd spoke to said it was terrific she couldn't get into it
 	
 	
 		you're kidding
 	
 	
 		well she's sort of a lightweight anyway you know her her uh her reading consists of uh have you ever heard of V C Andrews
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		yeah  you know stuff like that you know Danielle Steele you know you know stuff like that so she really she couldn't get into this but she i think she said she saw the movie she liked the movie i don't you know
 	
 	
 		i see
 		the movie was wonderful you didn't see it
 	
 	
 		yeah the movie was good but i well you know compared to the book right no
 	
 	
 		well true it didn't have the impact but i thought that they stayed uh they stayed very faithful to the book
 	
 	
 		well they did but um i don't think it was as scary as i expected it to be i i really you know
 		i i don't know i just didn't think it was as suspenseful as as
 		i expected it to be i don't know but it was a good it was a good movie
 	
 	
 		well
 		it's hard to top that book
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's true and i'm waiting his new one comes out sometime in the spring i think
 	
 	
 		oh really what's it about have you another serial killer
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh probably another murder thing you know that's usually what he you know well this this'll be i think his fourth or fifth book
 		and the other the previous ones were murder um the he wrote also Black Sunday which was a about the uh bombing in the in the Superdome oh it was oh and they made a movie out of that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		Two Minute Warning
 	
 	
 		um gee i don't know i think it was called Black Sunday it was about fifteen well no about ten years ago i guess it uh you know
 	
 	
 		you know i think you're right i think i
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		i'll have to look back and see what else he's written because he
 	
 	
 		that's all he's written Red Dragon  that one and uh Silence of the
 	
 	
 		really
