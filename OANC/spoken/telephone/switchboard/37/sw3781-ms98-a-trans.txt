 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i suppose we both have credit cards
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah they seem to be a part of life
 		
 
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah how do you use them
 	
 	
 		well i do use them um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i have a few favorites that i use more than others and uh i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable i i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they all can build up
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i think they're handy i just get
 		uh i don't carry a lot of cash with me and uh i hate writing checks
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when you go shopping
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well do you use credit cards
 	
 	
 		yeah i use a few i um
 		i watched my grandmother go into debt  on them and so i've and then i guess my mother yeah so my mother learned from that and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		your grandmother huh
 	
 	
 		basically um i just keep them i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know but otherwise um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i generally and my husband it turns out i've just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something but we always pay it off right that month
 	
 	
 		that's good
 		oh that's that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		so that way we keep any service charge so that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what we're spending
 	
 	
 		well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing it's really i guess ridiculous to let them keep building
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah that's what i feel
 	
 	
 		but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum it's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that i try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where i know that the bill's going to come but sometimes i forget and
 		so you know  a bill will come in and i'll think oh no i didn't know it was going to be that high but so far i've been able to we've been able to pay it off every time so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um yeah
 		well that's good i'm looking right now i'm kind kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate it seems that some of them have gotten higher
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i saw on TV they had a program on uh credit cards and they're supposed to i don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a
 		Visa card that was the lowest one in the country and i didn't write it down at the time and then i went and looked and to see what my Visa was and i think it's eighteen percent or something so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		think i want to find something that has a lower rate
 	
 	
 		yeah have you ever used Discover card
 	
 	
 		no i haven't
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off but you know
 	
 	
 		is is that the one from Sears
 	
 	
 		um i think Sears originally put it out but it's um it's pretty well taken all over the US now i mean uh i've haven't found many places that don't take Discover
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and there's no annual service fee which is good you know and then um
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		they also give you they say cash back um like at the end of the year for the amount that i charge i get two dollars back or something but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back
 	
 	
 		uh-huh oh
 		oh they give you money back for using your credit card
 	
 	
 		yeah basically that's it yeah basically that's it and i think the service charge is pretty low too but i'm not sure
 	
 	
 		oh i didn't know that
 		hum well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i worked with at Sears for over ten years and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know now they'll take the Discover but i still don't know if Sears will take Visa or MasterCard
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh i never did apply for a Discover card i just figure with the Visa and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		American Express i probably have an i can do enough damage with those two
 	
 	
 		yeah i think it's best to keep the number down  that you have
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah i've got some that i you know i haven't even used at all uh past few years i probably wouldn't be able to use them
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh i i do like my Dillard's i have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i do do use Dillard's probably as more than any of the other department stores
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well do you have anything else to say or
 	
 	
 		well yes no not too much more about credit cards
 	
 	
 		okay i don't think i do either so well it was good talking to you
 	
 	
 		okay well
 		good talking to you Beth
