 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		well Nancy what do you think um some of the changes in roles of women are in American society in the past generation or two
 	
 	
 		
  
 		well of course working
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's definitely got to be the biggest thing is that everybody's out there working
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		including me  well what do you think it is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um yeah i agree i also think that there are more um the people are women stay single longer it seems like
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes they do yeah they do
 	
 	
 		yeah i know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty and i waited until i was thirty two so
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know um i know that
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true it's a big change i'm an OB nurse and so i really do see what you're saying there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it used to be that our list ran nineteen twenty twenty one for our patients' ages
 		and now our care plans look more like thirty two thirty three if we get somebody twenty one we go oh look how young so yeah you're right there's a big change and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's true but again i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if they didn't have if they weren't out there working and having their careers
 		they probably would be married and having their children  so  i guess it's a combination
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah seems like there uh-huh go ahead
 	
 	
 		no go on
 	
 	
 		oh it just seems like there are more single mothers too i mean that's there're a lot of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		either divorced or um
 		you know never been married so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of mixed up families that's for sure yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree
 		well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so
 	
 	
 		well just that i think the families
 		the the role in the family and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um we do it all  i really think that and i know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers but i still think the mothers
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		have the major role i really do i think they're just
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they're not doing very much less i don't think as far as the kids and and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see and and they're contributing to the income besides
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think that we're really really putting a lot of stress on ourselves
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah and it really it's affecting the families you know for mothers not not to be home and yet you know um
 	
 	
 		oh it is
 	
 	
 		i mean i i don't blame anybody when they have to work  because um yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it's it's difficult and i think that i live in Plano actually so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's very wealthy town and we're not part of that but i  it is you know and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i really hate that you know i hate to see that and and i've been here for a very long time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but um
 		i don't know now i'm a single parent and i don't have a choice anymore but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i used to just work occasionally for extra money but now i have to work all the time and that's really hard and and i don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and leave the kids in a way it's good it's very good to get out with adults and i think that's a good thing if you can do it part time but to just go out there forty hours a week at least and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and work and and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing i think that's
 		not very smart i think that's difficult on them so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well what do you think's gonna happen in the next generation you think it'll continue yeah
 	
 	
 		well it's gonna be interesting i yeah i think it will change but i'm not sure how it's going to because i see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford
 		to buy a home and and to raise a family i don't know how they're gonna do it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again i don't think that ever will go backwards
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i don't know what effect it's gonna have on these kids now when they grow up how they're gonna feel about it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it you know it could lead to another Woodstock type thing you know where where there's just too much material things and and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they might wanna do without things rather than do that to their families it's hard to say
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah it is i think some
 		i don't know how many you know what percentage but some are will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children i guess i see that happening already
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		some choosing it and and they get you know there're people chide them for it you know why aren't you out
