 
     		
 	
 		so i've been concerned about crime lately um it's really scary to listen to the news every night and  to hear about all the problems i wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well i i think we have a neighborhood watch i think i'm not real we don't get real involved we're never home so  um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well i know they were gonna start one but uh i haven't heard any more since so i don't really know but as far as personally doing something no
 	
 	
 		no hm
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well  we moved in when we moved in there there wasn't any outside lights and so we've been trying to install some
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um outside lights and  we put up a fence in the backyard mostly you know not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in but that our children would be safe playing in the yard you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah huh
 	
 	
 		and i guess most of the crime that i'm concerned about generally is against my my kids it's scary to send them off down the street a few houses
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure it is
 	
 	
 		to let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i have to spend a good deal of time watching them  walk down the street and say call me before you leave and come back and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh i would too if i had kids we don't have any  we did install a um  a uh motion detector light back in our driveway
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that was  mainly it was so when we pulled up the light would come on but also we have a boat back there  and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief so we thought with that light you know it would
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		maybe keep them from doing something to the boat  yeah so
 	
 	
 		then that's a good thought
 		well we've been real lucky that i don't believe there's been you know much trouble in our neighborhood but it but it does seem there that there is a lot more here in Plano of um just
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		bored teenagers  vandalism
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's what it is we live in Coppell and and that's pretty much what it is is you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		kids that are bored like you say
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah and they don't uh i know my sister-in-law who lives in our neighborhood they've had their they've parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		a few things like that and course you know  i don't know  i'm getting scared for the kids to get older because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know  who and or is it just random
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		crime but um we've been real lucky that no one in my family with the anywhere that they live has had been a victim of you know a serious crime
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh it's really scary to know that you you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh i know it hm
 	
 	
 		but i guess i take a lot of  um little bit of um
 		
 
 		safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are like drug related or  um things that places usually that i wouldn't be going  and things i usually wouldn't be involved in
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah yeah huh
 	
 	
 		and uh there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to but it is scary
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it is it really is
 	
 	
 		were you raised in this area
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm originally from Chicago but i've been in this area in the Louisville area for  uh let's see about twenty three years
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so has it been getting worse that you've noticed or about the same hm
 	
 	
 		oh definitely  in the last few years i think and uh
 		like i say now i don't think necessarily in this area here but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just Dallas in general i don't know i think back of when i was uh younger and in my party days some of those things
 		i did you know i wouldn't be caught dead like being out that late at night  in a dark parking lot  so
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		take a lot of chances well i noticed that um
 		that uh when we we moved here from Houston not too long ago and so of course we were interested in schools and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but the schools in Houston all have big tall fences around them and they're not really very safe
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so it's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools don't have fences at all  around them and  it's just a whole different idea that that at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and in Houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and so that's been something that's been good for the  you know in this area that you feel like um you know there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today  and i guess i don't know how people live with that everyday
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um
 		i don't either
 	
 	
 		pretty scary
 	
 	
 		yeah hm
 	
 	
 		but anyway well i guess i won't take up more of your time
 	
 	
 		hm
