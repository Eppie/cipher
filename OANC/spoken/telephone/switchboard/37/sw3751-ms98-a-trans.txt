 
		
 			
 				are you Bob
 			
 			
 				
 				i am in Plano where are you
 			
 			
 				oh okay i am in Waco
 			
 			
 				is that right oh okay
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				right down the street
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				oh credit cards my favorite subject
 			
 			
 				you mean you use credit cards
 			
 			
 				oh do i uh
 			
 			
 				i bet you used them all up over Christmas
 			
 			
 				yeah mostly over Christmas uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off
 			
 			
 				
 				
 				and then your are in debt
 			
 			
 				and so then you have no money  so you use a credit card
 			
 			
 				
 				i understand that
 			
 			
 				so yeah uh i probably have one of every credit card there is
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				do you use them a lot
 			
 			
 				well uh it kind of comes and goes uh i use uh Citibank uh the Advantage one pretty much because you get
 			
 			
 				uh-huh
 			
 			
 				Advantage points for every dollar you spend and once a year i get a free airplane ride that way
 			
 			
 				oh
 			
 			
 				so
 				as long as you pay it off every month it doesn't cost you anything
 			
 			
 				yeah yeah well that is a good idea
 			
 			
 				so
 				that is what i
 			
 			
 				that through a Visa
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				uh-huh
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				huh
 			
 			
 				but uh
 				i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use but uh
 			
 			
 				uh-huh
 			
 			
 				if i can get away with paying them off every month it is alright if i don't then it gets expensive
 			
 			
 				yeah
 				yeah that is my problem i don't try and pay them off i pay like the minimum but i know  so i have got myself
 			
 			
 				well you shouldn't do that you you you never you you you never get out of the hole that way
 			
 			
 				exactly i have got that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				but i pay most of them on time and everything it is just the i always have them
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				so it is kind of strange
 			
 			
 				kind of like the federal government right
 			
 			
 				oh yeah exactly like the government  in
 			
 			
 				
 				never never get out of debt
 			
 			
 				in debt for
 			
 			
 				and any time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right
 			
 			
 				yeah yeah
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				have they put the cap on the interest rates
 			
 			
 				so
 				no
 			
 			
 				i didn't know if they actually did that or not i know they were  i know they were considering it
 			
 			
 				no
 				just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent the rest of the uh and me we got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent so
 			
 			
 				uh-huh yeah
 			
 			
 				
 			
 			
 				funny how that works isn't it
 			
 			
 				
 				thou thou who doesn't need credit gets cheap credit
 			
 			
 				i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety two as opposed to nineteen ninety one even nineteen ninety
 				i think i think it be amazing how much how many more people use it
 			
 			
 				well i think so because the
 			
 			
 				because of the economy yeah
 			
 			
 				that's right right you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at
 			
 			
 				exactly
 			
 			
 				yeah
 			
 			
 				i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that i think that would be interesting
 			
 			
 				do you do you have any uh credit union or anything where you work or anything like that do you
 			
 			
 				yeah i have a credit union
 			
 			
 				we have a Master Card or Visa too
