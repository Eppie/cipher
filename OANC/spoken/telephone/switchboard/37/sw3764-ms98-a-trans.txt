 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess you heard our conversation our topic for today was clothing
 	
 	
 		right yeah i certainly did
 	
 	
 		how you dress for work and season to season and everything
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how do you dress for work
 	
 	
 		well uh uh about the same i dress for school i uh i i'm a graduate i'm a graduate student so  i don't have to worry too much about uh what i wear too much of the time
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh which is nice uh  uh  i've uh although i do uh a lot of i'm a speech pathology major and so i do a lot of clinical work  and when i do clinic work then i have to uh uh look my best
 	
 	
 		you bet
 		look professional
 	
 	
 		yeah  unfortunately
 	
 	
 		yeah i understand i'm a i own my own company i'm in the i'm a manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and i'm very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but then when i travel it's a little different situation it's uh suit and sports coat tie and the whole bit because you go to meetings and you're required to look your best and look professional of course
 	
 	
 		yeah sure
 		uh-huh
 		yeah yeah uh do uh do you find that uh on the average do people give uh more credibility or less credibility to a to a professional to professionally professionally dressed individual
 	
 	
 		yeah i think in today's society uh there's more credibility quite honest
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i'll always remember i'll tell this real quick story when i graduated college my first job years ago uh thirty years ago twenty twenty nine years ago in fact was selling uh agricultural fertilizer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i worked for the uh Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical and i sold uh you know manure
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i would go out and call on farmers  and
 		i was always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls and so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		one day i got up and thought well i'll just go casual and do you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls  and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh he sort of expected me to dress as a professional so uh it was sort of was
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		even even the farmers oh wow
 	
 	
 		you bet even even back then so i've sort a uh
 		been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best but but here again i dress casual quite a bit so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		yeah certainly
 	
 	
 		it depends on who you call on in my business if i call on the  the JC Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago then i wear coat and tie if i call on just uh  a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i call on Oshman's sporting goods again it may be casual or it may be coat and tie so it just it it depends
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah it depends  sure uh so you don't you uh if you had the choice would you wear a tie or no
 	
 	
 		um
 		probably no
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		probably no
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because uh
 		today i believe you can get away with it but then it depends on who you're calling on who you're it'd be like your your minister standing up in front of you with no tie you just uh he'd be missing something although he shouldn't be evaluated on that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so it is it's it's just different
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that uh
 		that's uh  if if you wanted to to uh really get into a hot issue uh  well at least in some in some beliefs uh uh how people dress when they go to church is uh is uh sometimes a pretty pretty hot topic
 	
 	
 		yes it is
 	
 	
 		uh unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately
 	
 	
 		i'm uh  lightly a Catholic and the people uh that go to my church are you know the Catholics dress very casual you're liable to find
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		people in jeans and and and whatever but yet the way i was raised i'm a converted Catholic the way i was raised i was raised a Baptist and
 		it seems like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time but i guess that has changed also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh  uh yeah i'm i'm a  i i go to the Church of Christ i've been raised in Church of Christ and uh  i i uh
 		
 
 		too many times you you hear you hear a lot about what what you're uh supposed you're supposed to look your your Sunday best and uh  uh dress in proper attire and uh and sometimes that really disappoints me uh in
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		in uh
 		when i see in other economic areas uh like in Kentucky
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh you know people just don't have that and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because they don't have the clothes to wear
 	
 	
 		but at the very
 		that's a very good point i'm from West Virginia so i understand what you're saying there and there it's it's just a very good point
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but uh you shouldn't what's the old saying you shouldn't judge a book by its cover
 	
 	
 		certainly
 	
 	
 		and uh evaluation of of an individual of course i think it depends on the type of job responsibility you have i think you have to dress sort of accordingly
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and uh or evaluate a person by that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but what about season to season does i guess your dress changes
 	
 	
 		uh yeah a little bit uh  course in the summer if i can get away with it i wear uh uh a pair of shorts and that's it run around barefoot no shirt or anything  uh but uh
