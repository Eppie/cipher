 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		so how's your lawn and garden work
 	
 	
 		well today it's uh  we're not doing much with it because it's kind of raining outside but or snowing actually  uh
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yeah i understand that it actually is snowing cold and wet
 	
 	
 		but um actually my husband is in the other room um planning a um organic garden or organic treatment um
 	
 	
 		oh is he okay
 	
 	
 		yeah do you do a lot of lawn work
 	
 	
 		not so much anymore i'm i'm getting older i'm fifty two now so i've just uh i've sort of slowed down you know we use this rather than do it ourselves as far as fertilizing i utilize a service and i guess they do a an okay jype of job
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh and i've let this little kid that lives behind us cut our grass just a little bit this past year i think i'm gonna let him do it all this year just
 		i work uh i'm out of town quite a bit and i come home and seems like every Friday that's what i have to face on Saturday is doing my lawn so i just stopped doing that
 	
 	
 		well there was a time when my  husband had had had traveled a lot and um
 		so we had a service for the first year that we were in our house and the lawn looked great  um now that that he's home we don't um
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we haven't been treating it as well you know using fertilizer and stuff or i guess the lawn looks okay it's just that we don't we  still have a problem with weeds
 	
 	
 		oh i understand yeah we yeah we have a problem about every other year with weeds it it appears that every other year a service can get rid of them and uh but just just about every other year they come back
 	
 	
 		and
 		i think maybe they uh spread some because they're putting it down
 	
 	
 		it's a constant battle i tell you
 	
 	
 		but the thing that he is wanting to try this year is um using some organic treatments and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we're not real naturalists or anything but um
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what we have heard is that the  amount of fertilizer that we put on our lawns is about the same amount that a farmer would put on a whole entire crop
 	
 	
 		i understand
 	
 	
 		and uh  i have a cold so i'm having a hard time
 	
 	
 		i do too so i'm have the same problem
 	
 	
 		um but uh um so he wants to try doing some you know different kind of stuff i don't really know what it involves or um um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		at this point in time i enjoyed having the service when we did um
 		the only problem was they never told us when they were coming and then you find a note on your door that says water within two to three days and it was never uh right right but uh
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 		with a thirty five dollar bill  well well we didn't use one year before last a service because we  we had weeds like two years in a row and you know when you when you have a service you don't expect that so
 		we stopped and i sort of did it myself year before last then this last summer i'd went back to a service and then went but went to a new service and they appear to have be doing a better job
 	
 	
 		what service did you use
 	
 	
 		Lawn Doctor
 	
 	
 		Lawn Doctor
 	
 	
 		and we used to use one in Plano and we switched to one that's more local
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		one of our friends bought the one in Plano they just didn't uh didn't do that good a job on our lawn so we changed services
 	
 	
 		yeah we tried using Chem Lawn but um our problem is our front yard is completely different from the backyard
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um i think they just use the same stuff on everything because we've got a mixture our front yard is um all Bermuda what's not weeds
 	
 	

 		
 
 		right
 	
 	
 		and the backyard is a mixture of Saint Augustine Bermuda and some type of uh winter grass that stays green all all winter
 	
 	
 		right either rye or something
 	
 	
 		yeah something like that it's real clumpy and
 	
 	
 		yeah you can see i have we have a lot of trees in our yard so it's a it's you know during the summer it's bare under the trees so i've pratted a lot planted a lot of rye winter rye to grow because that will grow in the summertime under trees
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it's more of a shade it's a better shade grass so now as as cold as it is out there and as rainy as it is we have you can see where we planted all the green grass but as it's in the summer because that's that's the only green area in our lawn
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh  do you do you ever do you ever double sod or um  whatever
 	
 	
 		all of our Bermuda's all brown
 		we have on the side yard few years back right
 	
 	
 		you know where they mix the seed
 	
 	
 		i'm always uh you know sometimes i'm  sometimes i'm i'm over at Home Depot i'll just a grab a grass a thing of  of grass seed and put it in the old
 		spreader and just spread it real quick or throw it out in the areas where i think i need it but overall i guess we have a pretty good stand of grass they say in the summertime the hotter it is the better the Bermuda grows and course that supposedly quote will crowd out the weeds and everything so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i think that's our problem is that we we just need to get it fertilized really good so that we can get the grass grass growing rather than the weeds
 	
 	
 		so i just
 		
 
 		right how about how about flowers you have you have nice flowers in your front yard
 	
 	
 		um in the front yard not so much we have a lot
