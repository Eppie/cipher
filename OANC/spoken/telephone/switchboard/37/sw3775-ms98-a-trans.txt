 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
  
 		yes
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay um uh what's your house like
 	
 	
 		well it's four bedroom two bath a brick ranch house uh on a kind of a quiet dead end street next to a big wide open field
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 	
 	
 		but we're two blocks from everything you need including a small mall
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and lots of businesses within walking distance but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		your city is a big city
 	
 	
 		Austin's about a million people
 	
 	
 		oh i guess it is big
 	
 	
 		so it's it's it's it's it's a nice town it's real kind of a laid back place and uh kind of an environmentally conscious city
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum well my i have also have a four bedroom house
 		uh we have three bathrooms two upstairs and one downstairs
 		which makes it nice because um it's right off the garage so when Gene's working on his cars he can come in and take a shower without going through the rest of the house
 		and then um
 		i have a it's in a small city of like um eight thousand people
 		and i don't know if you've heard of Modesto that's the closest big city
 	
 	
 		i've heard of it i've never been there
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah and it's on a cul-de-sac um
 		which makes it nice because there's no through traffic you know about all the cars that come in here are people that just live right in here
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i like that feature about where we live that was one of the reasons we bought this house is because there's only six street six houses on the on the street so
 	
 	
 		yeah it makes a lot nicer space i say i imagine you have little kids right
 	
 	
 		no no  not at all i have uh one kid and he's twenty almost twenty one
 	
 	
 		oh okay well i have one also but he's he'll be thirty seven in uh February
 		so but anyhow i have lots of little neighbor kids and they all love me and i just just worship them they can come in my house i have candy for them and cookies for them
 		you know so i'm just like their aunt Rosy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh we still have
 		there are actually no kids right in the immediate neighborhood but uh we just moved here about two years ago and we still have kids from the old neighborhood which is only a few blocks they come to visit they expect  brownies
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah  it's
 	
 	
 		yeah they'll they'll stay till you bake a bunch but uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but anyhow as far as decorating my house and everything too i've uh stenciled uh practically
 		in every room in my house
 		which um it looked like it would be very hard to do but it ended up being really easy and it just really just makes the rooms
 		you know i stenciled right above the right below the ceiling line on the walls like it looks something like a wallpaper border but it's actually is a stencil
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		my wife and i've never tried any stenciling uh we've always thought we she wanted to anyway
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh somehow i feel like this particular house doesn't call for stenciling we've done some wallpapering and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh my wife really likes to paint different colors and things so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		that seems to be i think she ought to be a paint expert she's just in the wrong career field but uh we watch This Old House faithfully on Saturdays and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do all of our own uh decorating work and repair work around the house and yard work
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sometimes it's
 	
 	
 		well you can't afford to have it done you know plus it's fun i enjoy you know going out and working in the yard and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know just doing everything decorating the house up and changing it in fact i just bought a
 		a large bird cage i had seen in magazines how they were decorating them that not that i want a bird i don't want a bird
 		but i have decorated it up with flowers
 		and i got a little nest in there that looks like it's got two little birds in there and i've got some dolls sitting in there
 		it looks really really cute
 	
 	
 		yeah my wife just remodeled since Christmas she's remodeled our bedroom
 		with all new sheets comforters things like that and paint and she did a wallpaper border
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		new drapes uh looks it's just a whole different different atmosphere in there looks kind of like i like to hang out in there now during the daytime
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		yeah it's kind of fun to change too isn't it
 	
 	
 		it's just
 		yeah she picked a for the walls she picked a fudgesicle color
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		fudgesicle color no
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		which well i thought well i don't know if this'll work but when she finished
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it really looked good
 	
 	
 		yeah it probably goes with a lot of different colors too
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't think she meant for it to go with anything other than just fudgesicle walls and the ends the white trim
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um just to give it a little bit different look than what it's always been or been lately anyway so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		well you are the first man that i've talked to
 	
 	
 		really yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
