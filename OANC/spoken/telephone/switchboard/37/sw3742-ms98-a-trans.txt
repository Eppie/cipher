 
     		
 	
 		so what kind of hobbies you have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well the primary thing that i do uh is go around and uh collect uh collectibles that are purchase collectibles and uh and some antiques uh go to a lot of garage sales and estate sales
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and collect signatures
 	
 	
 		signatures like uh like important people i guess
 	
 	
 		uh yeah uh important people um oh some are just uh sports fans
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i had i land like aviation so i've got a number of them from uh uh like the Wright brothers uh uh Chuck Yeager um Charles Lindburgh things like that
 	
 	
 		hm that's pretty neat yeah  most of my hobbies are uh i guess i uh i like cars i work on i like to work on my car and uh yes since i have an old car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh do you
 		what do you have
 	
 	
 		i have a i have a Honda it's an eighty three Honda this car's not too bad i don't have to work on it as much but i've before this i had a Toyota Corona i don't know if you ever heard of those cars but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i had the car it's an eighty one Toyota Corona i must've worked on it like every third day i had it  i had a i had a problem with the uh with the radiator
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the car basically would overheat i mean i i lived used to live in Washington DC and didn't have any problems when i lived up there but soon as i came down here the heat was must must've been too intense for the car so the car kept overheating and turned out it was some kind of a problem with the radiator
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i had the radiator replaced and they did everything they could possibly do they said there was some kind of problem they just couldn't figure out what it was
 		and the Toyota dealer couldn't figure it out the radiator place couldn't figure it out so basically i had to keep adding water to the radiator every uh every couple days
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		you know and what you had to do is you had to start it up let it get hot let it suck the radiator fluid into the engine then add more water to it then shut it and then you could run another three days
 	
 	
 		well that sounds like fun
 	
 	
 		oh yeah let me tell you i mean it's it was bad when it was in the winter time you had to do this too you know
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah oh yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		no as a matter of fact i've been uh seriously considering uh restoring a car
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i was looking at a Nash Metropolitan
 		i don't know if you know what those are
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh
 	
 	
 		uh they're little two tone uh cars that came out in
 	
 	
 		oh is it like a mini car
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my my parents' next door neighbor have one of those
 	
 	
 		fifty
 		really
 	
 	
 		they uh it um i think his wife won it in some kind of contest and he just uh it looks almost like a fake car because it's so small it's you know and it's it's in perfect shape
 	
 	
 		huh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh he just kind of pulls it out every so often cleans it up puts it back in the garage
 	
 	
 		does he wanna sell it
 	
 	
 		yeah really but uh it's it's really a neat looking car though and uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah now i'm i've been trying to find one that's uh uh i was i was looking at getting one of those and trying to restore it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum um-hum um that's kind of kind of cool
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and the other hobby i have is uh i guess i play uh like the racket sports you know racquetball and tennis and i love to play that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 		both of them
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		because most of the folks that i found and i i used to play a lot of tennis then when i started playing racquetball uh by the time i finally got a swing down for racquetball i i found out i couldn't play tennis anymore
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		well what i did was i played tennis for a long time then hadn't played for a long time then i started pay playing racquetball again
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh when i got really good at racquetball then i waited a while and i went back to tennis and so now when i'm back to either one of the sports you know since i since the gap was so far apart between the two i think that i get back to tennis soon as i pick up a tennis racket i'm i'm back into the swing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh good
 	
 	
 		and soon as i pick up a racquetball racket i'm back it takes me a little while to to get as good you know uh i usually need you know at least a good hour warm-up before i'm i'm back into the swing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh once i'm back in it you know it's pretty good
 	
 	
 		well it's tough to those ceiling shots on a tennis court
 	
 	
 		oh  yeah that's definite yeah you don't it i have to really think about the uh the ceiling shots and the side wall shots you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh and that's probably it probably puts more pressure on my brain than it does in my on my body
 	
 	
 		i tell you i really like uh racquetball
 	
 	
 		it's a great sport see it's aerobic and uh and if you play with someone uh you got to play with someone who's as good as you are you know not better or not and not worse
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because if you play i used to play with uh my roommate and uh from college and we uh we were both about the same as far as you know how good we both were you know and we'd have volleys that would last five or six minutes you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it does  i mean we weren't like the best players in the world but we you know we we couldn't get it past each other you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i used to work out to play racquetball three or four times a week and i tell you by the end of the summer i was in perfect shape you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's it's a great sport great aerobic sport
 	
 	
 		i like it better than uh tennis just because i don't have to go so far to get the ball
 	
 	
 		well the only reason i like it better than tennis is i used to play tennis with my dad and he plays uh old man tennis you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		he could hit puts underspin on the ball all the time and he can hit every ball okay but he doesn't hit it hard he just hits it really lightly you know makes you run all over the place
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh  so who
 	
 	
 		and it just kind of drives me up the wall
