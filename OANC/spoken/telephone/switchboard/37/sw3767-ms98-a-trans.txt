 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right Miss Kathy so uh what do you do do you do it regularly and so forth
 	
 	
 		um yeah i do i play basketball on uh a city league and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		volleyball and
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well uh i have been so busy working i just retired about two weeks ago
 	
 	
 		oh congratulations
 	
 	
 		thank you my exercise basically has been what walking that i can get in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which hasn't really been quite enough but i could very definitely tell the difference when i have two or three hours off and i run around on campus i'm retired from Penn State University
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and when i have an afternoon to walk around on campus i i very definitely uh see a difference
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and it it i know that walking is good for you and uh i keep reading that it's much better for you than running because of the uh actions of the joints and so forth
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yep
 	
 	
 		but uh tell me about um your exercise did you take your exercise because you had a problem or you just wanted to stay young and light or whatever
 	
 	
 		um i do it purely for enjoyment in fact when i've started exercise programs that i felt like i had to do  you know a system of doing so many sit ups and that i haven't stuck with it and haven't enjoyed it either one so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i decided that i would just stay fit by doing team sports which is what i like more than just individual
 		um whatever
 	
 	
 		how many how many hours a week do you estimate that you perform these things
 	
 	
 		um probably
 		at least an hour a day
 	
 	
 		an hour a day uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah do and i have four children so that keeps me busy too and they're all involved in
 		sports mostly soccer so we
 		once they're out there i you know i get out there and kick it around with them sometimes
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		do you ever have time when you don't get this exercise in and notice that your weight goes up or anything like that
 	
 	
 		of course  of course
 	
 	
 		oh it's so you you can tell the difference
 	
 	
 		oh yeah not so much with weight as much as just not you know you feel sluggish and you get into that cycle where you don't want to exercise and so you don't and then you the  the vicious cycle where
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		where you don't exercise
 	
 	
 		i i understand what you're saying well what about eating do you uh
 		do anything about the the type of food you eat is that uh or do you just eat a normal balanced meal to go with that
 	
 	
 		yeah i just eat normally i don't regulate you know i'm not real regimented about what
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what i eat personally its too hard to to get myself on a certain diet having to fix for five other people in the house so
 	
 	
 		yeah that that does keep you busy
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		so you well uh
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well there're just two of us now my three children have all moved out
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh diet wise uh i'm trying to keep us on a low
 		uh weight the low fat type of a diet my wife has high cholesterol
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i'm trying to keep that down and and i do notice that when you go through
 		periods uh such as Christmas and so forth where you eat out more often than normal if you don't get the exercise in your weight weight goes up
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh for me exercise is one of the nicest ways of bringing that weight down
 	
 	
 		do you do it together with your wife or this mostly by yourself
 	
 	
 		and
 		no it's up until now its been mostly by myself because i would have been downtown and as i say walking around on campus picking up mail and and doing things like that
 		and running running downtown uh during my lunch period
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well it gives me an opportunity to get some walking in and
 	
 	
 		yeah i was gonna say you probably get a lot of walking in i know that i when i went to college you know just walking back and forth from different buildings you you have to
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		do you we have a bicycle in the house
 		uh the kind that you pump you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that seems to be uh probably other than walking that's probably one of the better things you can do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		have you ever tried one of those
 	
 	
 		i haven't
 		i haven't i do i have a bike and you know i usually have a child on the back of it because mine are little
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh well i was thinking with  you say you have four children
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		with four children and sometimes there may be times you can't get out to go play you need to stay home that maybe one of these mechanical bicycles would be very helpful to you
 	
 	
 		that would be a great yeah it sure would that would be a great idea
 	
 	
 		well very good
 		well i wish i could get my weight down i need to get out and get some exercise uh  as i say i've just retired so i'm just starting to have a few days to uh approach that subject and i'm
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		considering it i'm going to get on that bicycle that we have and uh start doing some riding and i'm sure that's going to be the quickest way to get things under control
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh that sounds
 		yeah probably do your kids still live close by you
 	
 	
 		no i have one lives in Amsterdam Holland and uh one lives in uh
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		near Warrington Pennsylvania and the other one is in New Jersey
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh they're spread around what did you teach
 	
 	
 		so
 		well i i have done research at Penn State i've i've uh not a teacher i've done research in under water acoustics
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well that yeah well that would be interesting do you study like mammals or just sound
 	
 	
 		it's been a noisy subject
