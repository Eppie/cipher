 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um are you from this area
 	
 	
 		i'm from Dallas yeah
 	
 	
 		oh okay i'm in Garland so well i'm in Dallas right now but i'm living in Garland um
 	
 	
 		okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i don't know if you know but Garland has got a real big recycling center
 		that in fact we went to yesterday you drive up and you take the stuff out of your trunk and they have different bins for the different materials like
 		clear glass and colored glass and plastics and uh they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that's pretty neat my my daughter is four and she's real interested in recycling  so we're we're trying to promote that because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them
 		uh does Dallas have a curbside recycling program yet
 	
 	
 		um well i don't know if Dallas is Richardson does
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		um they started with newspapers and uh of course aluminum cans and and bottles and plastic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i didn't know there were different types of plastic though
 	
 	
 		hum
 		yeah um like soda bottles are one kind one type of plastic and milk jugs are one type of plastic you can tell it's got it'll
 		most of the recyclable containers have a little symbol on the bottom with little with the arrows around it that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		it's it's just different kind of plastics like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic know that's what the different types are
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		yeah it seems to be made out of something different
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yes i i know there's a long scientific name but it's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff um i like
 	
 	
 		uh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know if if they do it all over but our Kroger does a a newspaper recycling every Saturday you can drive up and they have one of the clerks out there no the bag boys out there
 		um that will take the papers newspaper out of your car and they'll put it in their little bin
 		and they do the recycling i mean they collect the newspapers and their plastic the plastic grocery bags
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		which i think is pretty neat that's something since we all have seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags  i know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things
 	
 	
 		
  
 		hum
 		that's right yeah
 		um-hum
 		lunch bags and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah in fact i have one today it's um-hum the only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah they didn't
 	
 	
 		and  it's like whoops there goes my chips okay fine
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum
 	
 	
 		now i  in fact did you happen to see twenty twenty the other night
 	
 	
 		uh no
 	
 	
 		they did a program or the one of their articles was on recycling and or it was actually on a a town that has a dump that
 		they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there they have made so much money from that
 		that they built they bought a brand new fire engine and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough so they mought bought a new or built a new one paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh
 	
 	
 		they have built up one mountain they call it Mount Trashmore they built up one mountain covered it with grass and put ski lifts on it and in the winter they put snow on it and they charge to ski on it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so the city gets the money from that they built a golf course at the bottom and they get the money from that it's like that's it's a it's Riverview Ohio or some place up there
 	
 	
 		wow
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea they i mean their city hall looked better it was nicer than Dallas' and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and they like the trash so i like well
 		okay
 		but i thought that was pretty neat it it would be nice if more communities could do that but you have to know from beginning and you have to have the space to do it and
 	
 	
 		yeah they'll run out of space before long
 	
 	
 		yeah see that's well they're already planning a second mountain so they're gonna get going to be called the Twin Peaks i was like uh-huh go back to the TV shows
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling
 		oh it's we i know like i said i've got a two year old and a four year old and that's
 		my daughter thinks that anytime she sees newspapers bundled up they're being recycled so it's like well no honey so that like so that was one reason we went to show her
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		what people did with their their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well yeah you melt down the cans and you make them into new things and you get the paper all wet and you make it into new paper and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that's fun trying to explain that to a four year old  oh so do y'all go ahead and
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		they don't even know that paper comes from trees yet so
 	
 	
 		well yeah she that was the her next question was how do you grow paper
 	
 	
 		how do you grow paper
 	
 	
 		was like well from trees um that's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and how do you grow aluminum
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly um well let's see um  we really don't but and then she was like well what do you do with the glass well
 	
 	
 		um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you crunch it up real small and then you melt it down well what if it breaks well okay  it it it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing and she got our baby sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that's all she talked about so i guess what
 	
 	
 		um-hum
