 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay yeah Donna um you said you have three children what uh kinds of activities do you spend with them is it you know
 	
 	
 		okay um we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh my husband let's see he coaches basketball with Brian um so he spends time doing that with him planning and um practicing out side
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um he's a real sports kind of person so he plays tennis with with the kids we all kind of play tennis as a family except the baby plays on the play ground we take turns with her um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh let's see we have a computer and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer um
 		uh let's see what else we do oh i suppose we watch a little TV together we really don't watch i think as much TV as a lot of people we don't have HBO we do get the Disney channel for the kids
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh my kids have the Nintendo which they play and my husband sometimes joins them with that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh my little girl Jennifer likes to do crafty things and i'll take some time and do that with her
 		and of course we always read a bed time story at night and even the the older kids sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's neat
 	
 	
 		basically the story person because my husband doesn't have he gets home from work late or whatever and and usually once in a while he'll read the story to the little one but that's basically my job um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so do you find it difficult to find time or is it pretty natural uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it is it is hard because you know at the end of your day you want time for yourself and and it and that's kind of cutting into your your time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late but you know on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine they go upstairs at nine
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um now this weekend we'll have a baby sitter come and uh my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and um probably not too late maybe maybe Brian will still be up and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		spend some time with him but it is it's really hard you have to be a very unselfish person to to spend a lot of time with your kids i think
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah do you work during the day
 	
 	
 		uh no i don't work i last year um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities that was two days a week and even just those two days
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just seemed like it was a lot i don't know how i admire people that that can do it all but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i i want it kept it is hard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i can imagine yeah
 	
 	
 		um even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything and that's another thing i'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping um usually on the weekend and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son and and they'll be my helper and then they'll get to pick out some of the favorite snacks that they get to pick out so try to do things like that but it you know it's it's uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then of course they have a pretty um busy social calendar too  you fit it in with all that the that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah so what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general you know in America
 	
 	
 		i i think a lot of people a lot of people sit sit their kids in front of the TV and HBO and rent movies and and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		kind of leave them to their own means um i think you know it's very very easy to fall into that trap and i'm not um totally innocent of that because there's times when you just stay here watch a tape but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		um i think different parts of the country i think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids people are real
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and you know but um
 	
 	
 		oh that's good yeah
 		yeah well families are facing a challenge i know that with i'm a newlywed and we're you know thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years and
 	
 	
 		what um-hum
 		um-hum and it's it's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it's very hard to to cut back to one and um um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know if you have the type of job i have a friend that's a nurse and she can pick her hours and that's a a great career i i wish i would have gone into uh nursing  because she has such a flexible schedule but it's very hard to uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		spend time with the children and uh and your husband and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		do everything at once
 	
 	
 		yeah but i do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because
 	
 	
 		well i think it's a big it's a big um responsibility you just don't have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when you have children you have to say now this is different and you do have to give things up i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for the at least for the first two years of their lives i mean if you can possibly swing it because they
 	
 	
 		yeah
