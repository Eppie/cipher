 		i always liked that one they're always so funny and i also like The Cosby Show  those are probably my two favorites
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah

 		you know i've watched that one time and it was really good but now that's on what Saturday night
 	
 	
 		uh it's either Friday night it's either tonight or tomorrow night um around here at least
 	
 	
 		is it Saturday
 		uh-huh i can't i can't remember
 	
 	
 		i guess it depends on what channel you're getting you know what system you're getting it through
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah  i yeah i saw it one time and i really liked it but i just haven't uh seen it you know watched it since
 	
 	
 		uh we we always enjoyed it it it seems to be kind of halfway between um
 		something like All In The Family and uh Hill Street Blues
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh it's it's it's it's a good show
 	
 	
 		yeah the episode that i watched um
 		i liked him because even though he's a law enforcement officer you know sometimes the laws are kind of ridiculous and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason
 	
 	
 		you tend
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and he seems to do that sometimes
 	
 	
 		he he tenderhearted fellow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i i guess that's what first drew us to him the uh
 		the the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought it was a pretty good show
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		i also like i i like to watch like Sixty Minutes and Twenty Twenty
 	
 	
 		yeah um i don't know we uh
 		watch Commish any chance we get
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um used to be a big fan of Star Trek but that's kind of they they it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against um anything
 		spiritual
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		i've never  gotten into the Star Trek era

 		well we're we're expecting our first in about three months so i know we won't be watching as much as we do now
 	
 	
 		yeah this one here is our first and and we're both full time students so
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that must be tough
 	
 	
 		what are you hoping for a boy or a girl
 	
 	
 		it doesn't matter just a healthy baby
 	
 	
 		that that's that's the best way you you haven't found out yet or anything have you
 	
 	
 		well we had a sonogram but we told him not to tell us so it's gonna be a surprise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's the best way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean it's like finding out somewhere in July what you're gonna get for Christmas i mean you know it's it's it's not as much fun oh
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's not quite the same
 		yeah  i agree  i'm sure we'll be watching more uh children oriented television shows
 	
 	
 		anyway
 		yeah
 		oh i'm about half kid heart anyway
 	
 	
 		oh i am too i still watch cartoons sometimes every once in a while  when my sister comes to visit so
 	
 	
 		i i
 		well
 		the new cartoons don't seem to be worth much but the uh well a couple of the uh ones Disney's doing aren't too bad but
 	
 	
 		well you know it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know i remember like the Flintstones and the Jetsons and those were just kind of good old cartoons
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the the the worst of the violence in the Flintstones was when somebody gave Fred a poke in the snoot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but oh shoot i mean blowing up galaxies and and putting a curse on the whole planet or or or you know or on all the you know everything of this species you know just all kinds of crud
 	
 	
 		yep
 		yeah and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays
 	
 	
 		yeah everything's mutations and and and killing and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
