 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i was just wondering if you had had any experience with um
 		the care of the elderly
 	
 	
 		yes i have in fact uh just a little over just a little less than a year ago uh my mother went to be with the Lord and we cared for her the last uh oh seventeen months of her life here in the at home
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		aside from uh
 		having to uh take her to the hospital
 		and uh you know those times well she was there in the the regular hospital
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer and so the doctor elected to have her uh finish out uh in the hospice program
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i as far as i'm concerned that is far and above any nursing home
 		because uh she's around her own family you know the the elderly parent in question is around their own family the uh hospice program provides a
 		hospital type bed well it is a hospital bed and all the oxygen stuff and a uh and a visiting nurse at least every other day et cetera et cetera et cetera
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's nice
 	
 	
 		and it's all taken care of by by uh Medicare uh
 		and uh it it's it's really neat uh and i you know i wouldn't i wouldn't banish uh my old loved one to a to a warehouse
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		and that's that's what i basically uh view a nursing home as a warehouse
 		so  that's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it's really sad
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		it's really a sad situation
 	
 	
 		uh-huh no
 	
 	
 		and uh i think a lot of people struggle with
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever you know the parent is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		doesn't always want the in-law living in the house is that right
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well that's really sad
 	
 	
 		yeah i know but uh in this case
 		uh spouse and i uh
 		are uh we're are are are uh united in this area because i guess her father her grandfather and grandmother both lived with uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		her parents
 		uh their their their golden years to so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		this isn't like uh uh
 		just one one uh instance in fact uh her uh
 		uh experiences were were invaluable to me
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh  in fact i don't know if i could have uh held up uh you know without my wife uh helping in this this this case
 	
 	
 		right
 		yes well i know when the
 		i remember being a child and my grandmother had had  several several strokes and things and that we had
 		my parents tried to keep her in the house and they did for a long time i couldn't tell you how long until she got uh where she had to have complete care
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and just they couldn't you know keep her in the house anymore and it was really hard on everyone that she had to have you know twenty four hour a day care
 		and i don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that um they put her there and we all went just constantly until she died
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but it was very hard on everyone to see
 		well you know grandmother be like that
 		and i don't know that you know  i don't being so young i don't remember why
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know what was why she had to go there
 	
 	
 		well maybe uh uh well as as you say the the care
 		of of grandmother or was was to such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it
 	
 	
 		um-hum well i do remember that she was you know totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way and that that they couldn't they found that they could not you know give her
 	
 	
 		oh boy yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the hygienic care and everything that she needed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well then then there's almost then there's
 		almost no no uh
 		uh choice left to her then
 	
 	
 		no but like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though you know in the nursing home i do remember the other patients there um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother because they got some interaction with someone
 	
 	
 		right
 		in fact just to just to sit and chat with them for five minutes and and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 		right and i guess that's hard on people to give
 		give up their lives if they're busy they don't you know it's easy to abandon people because we do have the nursing homes i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		if you can afford them
 		but
 		anyway well i'm glad it worked out good for your family
 	
 	
 		and then and
 		oh yeah it did and i was just praised i just praised the Lord that that we were able to uh
 		have uh
 		uh be
