 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		think of the job benefits you have
 	
 	
 		well i i think uh so far they've been pretty pretty good except the medical uh
 		not not the medical the dental insurance
 	
 	
 		the dental insurance
 	
 	
 		yeah i yeah i think um
 	
 	
 		um do you work for TI
 		okay hum
 	
 	
 		i know i went to have a tooth pulled
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh it the cavity had gotten really bad and they they wouldn't uh cover it because they said it it was a pre existing  condition
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you know how you wait you wait as long as you can
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sometimes to to lose a tooth and then to for them to come up with something like that it i i just thought that was that was pretty bad
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		hm that does sound pretty bogus
 	
 	
 		and then one time i had a tooth capped you know one of my caps fell fell off and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they paid for the the cap but they wouldn't pay for the build up
 	
 	
 		hm
 		that sounds kind of strange
 	
 	
 		and i didn't understand that either
 	
 	
 		who's your who's your dental care through
 	
 	
 		uh well uh it's it's a part of Aetna
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um
 		ours is through uh Cigna
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it's not too bad i mean i haven't
 		i haven't been to the dentist a whole lot except for like just regular visits
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh they haven't been bad they haven't uh they've been pretty good how about your uh do you have an HMO or
 	
 	
 		well i had an HMO up to this year i switched
 	
 	
 		you you went to like a regular plan
 	
 	
 		yeah i went to regular Aetna uh i thought that the HMO was really great uh
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know because
 	
 	
 		did it get expensive or
 	
 	
 		yeah it's gotten expensive because right now i'm i'm only i only have myself so i don't have to pay anything for Aetna the Kaiser uh premium got a little higher than it you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum i have i have Kaiser right now and uh i think uh  i personally i i think HMO's are scammy now  just because uh it's only five dollars a visit every time i go that's not bad okay and it's five dollars prescription
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		really
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		every time i go and they give you the generic stuff anyway
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but uh every time i go there you got to pay three dollars for parking
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know  and
 		so if i go to make a like i i called in one time i wanted to see a doctor about my backache i someone had just hit me and uh and i you know i had some muscle stiffness i wanted to go get some uh some some medication show my back to a doctor
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they wouldn't let me see a doctor they said no you know uh just just uh take some Ibuprofen and put a pillow on your back you know and i'm
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that was a problem that i had with them toward the end of the year i was i was really in a lot of pain and i went there and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they they gave me an appointment for about a month away
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so i went to the health food store and got some teas and stuff and started drinking them i got okay but uh and i didn't go back
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i was just really annoyed with them because i uh i i tried profusely to get an appointment uh to see you know and i said i if you don't give me an appointment i'm just gonna go to an emergency visit to emergency room and and send you guys the bill
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's what i thought about later i would've probably uh been better off if i just went to emergency and you just bill
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum and and that's that's the only way you're going to get any action out of them you know if you threaten them with that you know because i said i just had the accident and i don't wanna wait too long
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		before anything happens they're like well wait another day and call us back and i'm like i don't wanna wait another day i want an appointment now
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah after i really thought about it some more the i i really could've done that but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i was hospitalized uh
 		uh about three years ago i had some surgery
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and Kaiser was really good for that because i didn't have to pay any of it at all
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's real handy once you're you know if you like my roommate broke his arm
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he went to the hospital he went in to the emergency room and they took care of his arm and he every time he went to one he only had to pay five dollars and he probably went through you know quite a bit of care uh the medicine was expensive the cast was expensive the stitches were expensive and all that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh you know it it was real cheap i mean once you have a condition and you go to the hospital it probably works out real uh but for just like
 		i don't know i'm i'm only twenty four years old you know i don't really get sick a lot you know i in fact uh over the last two years i've only gone to see the doctor once and that was for a physical
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so you know for me
 		you know i don't i don't see the doctor a whole hell of a lot you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but then again you know the year before that i when i had the regular plan you know you have a hundred dollar deductible
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		well i went to the doctor once and it cost me ninety bucks so it was like oh well
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		i guess i could've done pretty good with the five dollar visit
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		well my uh my Kaiser premium
 		would cost me like forty something dollars a month starting this year
 	
 	
 		wow that's a lot
 	
 	
 		and TI will cover uh whatever they would have covered for Aetna but the premium is still forty dollars more than that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum yeah Kaiser's expensive i mean i think it's uh this year it's like almost four thousand eight hundred dollars
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so i went back to Aetna because i i won't hav e to pay anything
 	
 	
 		yeah that works that works out pretty handy
 	
 	
 		and uh although they do have a deductible that forty dollars a month will add up to that pretty quick
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 	
 	
 		it works out okay i think if you have kids though the HMO is probably the best
 	
 	
 		um-hum
