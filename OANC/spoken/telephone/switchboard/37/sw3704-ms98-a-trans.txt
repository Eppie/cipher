 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		what was the topic
 	
 	
 		uh just about um it would be interesting to discuss the social changes of the last ten or twenty years
 	
 	
 		i said uh
 		right right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and um i guess for me the most obvious is women in the work field
 	
 	
 		well that's a good one i hadn't thought about that yeah
 	
 	
 		that uh of course when i was growing up not very many women went to work at all most everyone was at home
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		and some of my friends whose mothers were teachers or something seemed a little bit embarrassed that their mothers weren't at home
 	
 	
 		uh oh
 		there there was a stigma attached to it
 	
 	
 		yes and uh but nowadays it's just so common
 	
 	
 		and and a necessity
 	
 	
 		a necessity and that when i am uh at home now that i've had children i've stopped uh working
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that it's kind of embarrassing when i go to a store and they ask uh when i write a check out and then they say can i have your work number please and then i don't have a work number to get give to them and they begin to think um i wonder if this is a good check
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah really i well i hadn't thought about it i can see i i think if they asked me for a work number i'd just write down my home number you know because that's where you work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		yeah well the thing that i was thinking about uh huh you know social changes i i thought well
 		you know in a lot of different ways i i think number one just the the makeup of American society how much it's changed i mean uh
 		uh i live in Houston but i'm i'm in Miami right now on business and uh i mean in Miami it's i mean honestly English is almost a second language now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes
 	
 	
 		uh you know with all the uh influx of uh  South Americans and uh Cubans and the the Latins are are just uh
 		i i guess a majority in Miami you know of course in Houston uh you've got the people from Mexico so that's certainly a change in the the fabric of society uh
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		the other thing that i was thinking about uh the way that things have changed  so dramatically is twenty or thirty years ago uh
 		you know air travel was still uh and not that much in the forefront uh uh and and now i mean it's you know hardly anybody thinks anything about getting on a plane and and going cross country
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		plus the other thing i was thinking about was just the very fact that we're doing what we're doing tonight uh
 		you know calling a one eight hundred number having a computer hook us up uh tell us the topic of conversation uh and and we take that rather for granted
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh you know thirty years ago uh  a long distance phone call was a sort of a special event
 	
 	
 		yes that's true
 	
 	
 		and and and you know and it wouldn't be uncommon for it to have been placed through an operator up i don't know if you know i guess you maybe they did have one plus dialing uh in nineteen sixty one but uh i i'm not sure of that
 	
 	
 		right
 		no and it wasn't like my parents always watch the clock carefully when they make any long distance phone call and it's it's pennies but for them it's just a socialized behavior
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		that's right and it harks back to the days like i say when when a long distance call was an expensive uh uh  i don't want to say a frivolous but it was an extravagant uh event
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and good grief if my parents knew what my long distance bill was every month they'd have a stroke
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true  that's probably true
 	
 	
 		but you know it's something that i've just i mean i factor that in i mean that's that's part of my budget i mean i expect to have you know a seventy or eighty dollar phone bill and quite frankly am pleased if it's anything below that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right me too
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's good in in in our homes we all have a lot uh much more high tech compared to the people ten twenty years ago
 	
 	
 		oh well and you know microwaves
 	
 	
 		right unbelievable and everyone has uh multiple televisions probably and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i've got yeah i mean i've i'm single and i have three televisions you know and i really they're two well
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		one of them is primary and the other one i turn on maybe three times a month and i've got another one i bet i haven't turned on in six months i mean it's there you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think about it too i have uh uh four telephones
 	
 	
 		right we
 		load up on all of the conveniences and they're not special to us anymore just a
 	
 	
 		um
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		necessity and there's the people who don't have televisions are
 		are uh you know unusual in our society
 	
 	
 		yeah uh yeah it almost like uh you know it's a big uh
 		issue i've run across a few people before that that you know make a make a point uh that uh the fact that they uh don't own a television and of course you know people look at them yeah like yeah you know but
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's it's it would be really quite frankly even though i am not
