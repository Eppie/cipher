 
     		
 	
 		any vacations recently that you would highly recommend
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well
 		that is like my favorite hobby  so yeah i travel everywhere and i've been all over Europe and
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		a lot of the United States and Hawaii and
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so when i can that's what i do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh  what what has been your favorite trip do you think
 	
 	
 		well i'm not sure um i guess Hawaii is one of my favorite places
 	
 	
 		really better than Europe
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well no that's exciting you know i've been several times so after the first time it's like anywhere you know it loses that newness but
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah i love it i love to go over to Europe i do and mostly i've traveled through Germany and Switzerland and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we have good friends in England so i've been there quite a bit and i just love it all i love to look at the different people and the different cultures and to see how different things are from the way we do them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the most interesting part more than the museums and things like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so how about you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well uh  i have never been i've been to Canada several times but uh that is about it for me i'm i'm from a Denver and so uh growing up uh  we would spend most of our vacations right there in Colorado
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh my family is uh uh real into camping and four wheeling and so um several i i think maybe uh four summers in a row
 		uh we spent uh our vacation time in the summer uh four wheeling through uh  portions of uh the southern half of of Colorado uh and
 		and uh every time uh my mother had uh uh i have two other sisters and my mother had us uh do some studying of the the area which we were going to visit and then we had to write uh
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		uh reports reports about it during during our vacation which which was really fun it was really fun we we we each got to write little books uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and  uh it it had sparked an interest that uh uh of of mine that uh my fiancee is a is a um very very good photographer that's what she had originally gone to school to do was photography and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i'm close to receiving my English degree uh as as well as my my graduate degree so so i uh
 		uh we've thought very seriously of trying to to uh incorporate travel into writing and and writing a book about uh uh some portion of travel
 		uh so  we're hoping soon uh not soon maybe within the next ten years to get to take a trip over from uh over over to Europe and take a trip from the northern portion of France
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh down to the southern tip of Spain uh  and follow uh it there's kind of a backward S shape uh
 		trail that the pilgrims use to take uh in in  uh back in the medieval times uh to see the relics uh in in Southern Spain and in Italy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so we would like to take pictures of the Gothic uh and Romanesque uh monasteries and uh just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it
 	
 	
 		boy that would be quite a project
 	
 	
 		yeah it would be  it's it's our big dream
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well it would be a lot fun you know there's there's good and there's bad and my experience in Italy wasn't my favorite for sure but
 	
 	
 		oh sure really
 	
 	
 		well i flew into Milan my daughter is uh a twirling champion
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	

 		and she had to perform over there and in Turin and so we had to fly into Milan and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the Italians even if they speak English they don't wanna let you know
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		and they gave us all the wrong directions and there were just two of us at the airport they put us on the wrong bus but finally we saw a policeman he put us on the subway we sat there um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we didn't know Italian we looked at each other we said things like spaghetti you know things like that and we finally followed some kids he told us where to get off we followed these kids with uh gym bags and we figured that must be the sports arena
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we lucked out and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground i mean it was just it was kind of a nightmare but  that was our experience and i guess all of Italy isn't like that
 	
 	
 		wow
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		but where we were it certainly was and the hotel that we stayed in we stayed with our English friends their team in the hotel and it was beautiful it was very modern
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but it was very far away on a bus so  you know it was it was really uh it was interesting you always learn something
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		and you will always have a fun experience so it it's great you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		you said you've been to England several times
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i wonder have you ever been to a uh a small town uh well it's it's actually about uh thirty minutes from Salisbury it's called uh Bemerton
 	
 	
 		no i haven't huh-uh our friends live like an hour outside of England like Ash around there so um-hum
 	
 	
 		okay
 		oh okay all right yeah i i i the reason i'm curious um i uh that's the other place i would like to visit uh most
