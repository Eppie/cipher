 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay i was watching the soap opera awards um and and it's it's really making me wanna exercise because every single woman in the audience is
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		about ten pounds
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so um i started anchoring last up anchoring uh exercising last
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		about last Spring when i i joined the President's Health Club and i was really motivated and going and i went uh for a little while uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i went pretty regularly but it's hard to go regularly for a long time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and where i live in Waco uh they don't have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's so now i don't have a club and i'm i don't have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly
 		or something like that so i'm not exercising at the time at the moment so i wish i could i wish i did have the motivation to get out and do that but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i just don't like just running with no where to go and i just can't do that so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		well i understand that i've been trying to get myself motivated i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh she had injured her back and needed a walking partner and i thought that'd be the time to get going
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks and uh then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York and so she's not around
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning and i don't seem to find time in the day time and of course it's motivation that's keeping me from really looking for that opportunity
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		i think a lot of times if you have someone
 		to uh work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation and you can also i mean you can you know pretty much do it privately if you had your own private uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		sort of contest you know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that and that would keep you going
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah well more than weight course i could use uh lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds but i think more than that i also notice i just feel better when i exercise
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and that's something that i'm motivated about now because i do need to get myself feeling better and just in better shape but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i um all the same it's connected to my attitude because i'm not feeling as perky and good i'm also it's hard to get my attitude to to get myself out there
 	
 	
 		that's very true it seems like you walk quicker and you just perky is a good word for it when you when you exercise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i understand that walking is suppose to be like the best exercise better than running things like that because it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it it doesn't
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		and you have less less chance of of hurting yourself
 	
 	
 		yeah it doesn't you know hurt you like i understand running hurts your shins or knees or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah the last time i tried running with my daughter because she's supposed to be jogging in P E and it felt good but then i had
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		pulled a muscle in my knee actually i hyper extended it or something and uh boy i was suffering for a good three weeks later
 	
 	
 		wow
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so and i'd never had that problem before but i guess age is starting to catch up to me  it's showing up in the weirdest places
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh oh
 		huh i guess my favorite my favorite exercise in the uh in the gym is the bikes to go yeah just with the the stationary bikes to just ride
 	
 	
 		oh is it
 	
 	
 		and if you're watching television they usually have television in there or something or if you're listening to a walkman it's pretty it's pretty okay
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		again that's sort of weird because you're you've not going anywhere and it i i used to play racquetball and i really loved that because though it to me it had a point
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know it was there was points you could you you would make and you know there was a point to it but running and jogging and just not going anywhere it's just because i don't i just can't understand that so i don't do it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well i've got a dog now and and of course she needs walking and so that's a little less try you know uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her and i do put on the earphones to have something to listen to and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 		hum
 		yeah i know a lot of people just to be safe like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning early in the morning um you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know like early in the mornings things like that i never tried that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know i've i never really even thought about it really
 	
 	
 		that's kind of an idea uh we
 		we have uh over here in Plano a little recreation center that's got a walking track that is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it anytime of the year
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but i find it very tedious because i'm watching the clock constantly and it's just nothing else to look at and i actually get more tired doing that than
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good and there i could barely make a couple miles
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
