 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		are you there okay now tell me your favorite team
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh baseball
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well i've been kind of  been intrigued with the Rangers
 		uh
 		more so with uh
 		uh their management than anything else i'd i don't follow baseball that that closely
 		but uh since you know since i live here so close to Arlington uh
 		that's the team that i've been kind of following
 	
 	
 		okay i think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think they're headed
 		so we'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		what are your thinkings on what they can do what they'll be able to do
 	
 	
 		well i think that uh
 		you know with uh
 		so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's um
 		you know i think
 		i'm not real sure about that do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's uh
 	
 	
 		well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his
 	
 	
 		yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the Rangers will go up a little bit
 	
 	
 		yes and the Rangers go up a little bit um-hum
 	
 	
 		yeah but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty five million that's a lot of money
 	
 	
 		i think the entire baseball yeah they're the ones that probably are paying the highest
 	
 	
 		yeah they are
 	
 	
 		and i think this is absolutely ridiculous
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i really think i really think that uh that they ought to
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		i'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money i think they should uh
 		uh pay him what his salary's going to be
 		uh and let him because he's got one more year before he turns into a a free agent
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and then uh who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway
 		but if he doesn't then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the six you know the six million dollars a year this year
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what i saw on the news today that Buechele Buechele was back just to visit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'm awful sorry he's not still
 	
 	
 		oh yeah but you know what he that was a great deal for him
 	
 	
 		oh i'm sure it was
 	
 	
 		yeah it was a great deal for him and and uh he just signed on uh i think it was like a five year deal with uh
 	
 	
 		Pittsburgh yeah
 	
 	
 		Pittsburgh so you know he's real happy there as far as the Rangers are concerned i think
 		i think they need some definitely need some pitching
 	
 	
 		yes sir
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and so i you know i
 	
 	
 		well what do you think of Howse
 		who is the coach for the pitchers
 	
 	
 		um the pitching coach
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well you know i was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a a a black guy that was going was helping out uh
 	
 	
 		his assistant
 	
 	
 		his assistant and i think that's a a great addition i mean he seemed to know what he was doing and and uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i really wish they could
 		see fit to get rid of Howse
 	
 	
 		oh you don't like Howse huh
 	
 	
 		no no i really don't
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i'm not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that but i'm not fond of Howse and i'm not fond of Grieves
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh Tom Grieve
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm not sure that um that they're ready to get rid of of uh Tom Grieve yet
 		but Howse might be a different uh situation and i think you're probably right that they
 		that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe and
 		um
 	
 	
 		well i'm just gullible enough that i think Bobby Valentine is um uh doing all right
 		and i'm sure well
 	
 	
 		you do huh
 		that's contrary to uh popular belief you know
 	
 	
 		oh i know i know so but i would like so much
 		for these Rangers to get their act together and give um
 		oh uh Nolan Ryan the support he needs
 	
 	
 		oh i know you know it's too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the Rangers you know
 	
 	
 		i understand
 	
 	
 		they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead and
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		well
 		i just  oh i have so many mixed emotions about all this but i think with their new stadium they should go and let's us have
 	
 	
 		yeah
