 		well we went to California over Christmas
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so that was nice we traveled by car though and that wasn't real nice because i have four children
 	
 	
 		ooh that's a long trip with four kids in the car
 	
 	
 		it surely was
 	
 	
 		yeah uh that sort of a trip can be kind of long just by yourself
 	
 	
 		well yeah we went to spend Christmas with my my family there and then my um girls are real involved in soccer and so we had a soccer tournament there also but
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		well that works out
 	
 	
 		yeah it was real nice the weather weather cooperated and and it was real pretty there how about you where have have you gone mostly East
 	
 	
 		uh yeah
 		uh yeah so far the about as far East as i've gone uh trip  about five years ago up to uh Minneapolis uh flew up and then drove back
 	
 	
 		oh
 		how was the drive back
 	
 	
 		uh well uh the weather was wonderful the roads were fine  uh the car i was driving back was a problem it kept wanting to fall apart
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's no good
 	
 	
 		basically i was bringing it back for the sons of a the lady i was renting from
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh because one son living up there owned it wanted it rebuilt uh and restored and son back here was going to do it but couldn't get loose for a couple few days to go up and get it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		what time of the year did you drive
 	
 	
 		oh that was uh in May  the weather was wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah i was gonna say the weather probably was real pretty then
 	
 	
 		yeah um  flew up it was the first time i'd flown and uh flew up just above uh thunderstorms that stretch from Texas at least up into uh the Great Lake area
 	
 	
 		yeah they have some whopper of thunderstorms  out on these plains
 	
 	
 		so we're watching
 		oh yeah yeah we got to watch i got i got to watch uh thunderstorm from the other side for once unique experience yeah the lightning from the top side is a unique experience
 	
 	
 		lots of lightning
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i always enjoyed watching it from the bottom side but it's even more fun from the top
 	
 	
 		huh now
 	
 	
 		um most of our vacations though have been you know camping trips of one sort or another or just going home to see family
 	
 	
 		and now i hear that you have children in the background
 	
 	
 		i well actually i'm at a pay phone the post office
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um no i do have one child he's about twelve weeks old twelve and half weeks old now
 	
 	
 		oh congratulations you'll be taking him on some of trips then i guess
 	
 	
 		why thank you
 		yeah yeah from looks of things  wife and i are both in school
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the next trip is probably going to be next Christmas uh several of my siblings have decided that it'd been too long since we were home for Christmas
 	
 	
 		now where's home
 	
 	
 		uh West Virginia uh that's home for me
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i met her down here so her home town is only about uh an hour and half drive away
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i'm a thousand miles from home so they're supposed to they're they're trying to arrange to get us train tickets uh to go up home three of us
 	
 	
 		oh
 		like an Amtrak
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		huh have you been to Georgia
 	
 	
 		yep
 		i've been through the northwest corner of Georgia that's been it uh that's pretty much in route between here and home
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so there's about a nine mile stretch of Interstate fifty nine that cuts through the northwest corner of Georgia
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well we went there last summer again for a soccer tournament and it was just beautiful there
 	
 	
 		but uh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they have some kind of vine there that grows up and down and up and down trees
 	
 	
 		kudzu
 	
 	
 		yes that was it
 	
 	
 		yes this stuff is an absolute white on humanity it seems
 	
 	
 		yeah but it's so pretty
 	
 	
 		is it's pretty it it's it when it's genetically engineered
 		that's the that's the southern version of what they've got up north called multiflora rose which is also engineered and it's almost indestructible
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i mean you about have to expose the
 		you know the first four feet  of the soil to you know  high levels of radiation to kill it off it this stuff is incredibly durable
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah see i kept talking about how beautiful it was and the natives there just would roll their eyes like you're crazy  this is awful stuff but i remember calling home and saying it's too pretty here all i'm staying forever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah its
 		well you see that stuff what eventually take over everything and literally kill off large old trees if it gets the chance
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so most that states in the Southeast have uh spraying programs where they go in with defoliants and try and kill it off
 	
 	
 		so do you have that there
 	
 	
 		here in in Hattiesburg area no not yet  but apparently it moving this direction
 	
 	
 		and me yeah
 		not yet uh huh it's coming huh
 	
 	
 		actually up in the Delta you know four or five hours drive north along the Mississippi River they've got it there too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but right now it hasn't really hit the uh the the general area around here place
 	
 	
 		yeah so what about South have you been to Florida
 	
 	
 		uh one trip i used to be an auto mechanic
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and one evening i got sent down into let's see Fort Walton Beach with a wrecker to tow a van back for a
 	
 	
 		yeah
