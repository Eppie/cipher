 
     		
 	
 		so i guess most of what happens happens in Salt Lake which is just about twenty miles south of us and that's quite a bit bigger and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they were just talking about how they had all these drive by shootings and stuff and it sounded like it was getting to be like LA a little bit but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		do you have gang problems
 	
 	
 		yeah it's there they they say its getting a lot bigger uh
 	
 	
 		well i'm a school principal
 	
 	
 		oh are you so you're right familiar with all that i bet
 	
 	
 		um-hum elementary school
 		well its elementary school
 	
 	
 		oh it's a what
 	
 	
 		elementary but i have gang problems
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		oh at that young huh you're kidding at which
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i'm in a part of Dallas where there's a lot of gang activity and my i have through the sixth grade
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but some of my sixth graders will be thirteen fourteen years old
 	
 	
 		yeah so they're getting started
 	
 	
 		and they get recruited
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		we we have really very significant problems
 	
 	
 		i'll bet
 		my wife was just uh talking to her mother and uh i guess they said they had an F B I come guy come to there she she works in a middle school and they were talking about how the hats signify you know gang and stuff like that and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh that you know it some day it'll eventually past but right now they say there's all kinds of kids getting beat up because of the they wear the wrong hat on the wrong street and that's get it's getting pretty darn scary i've got a little eighteen
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		its its surprising to me that it's that true there because  the only time i've ever been to Utah
 	
 	
 		it
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i spent a week on the Brigham Young campus at a workshop
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it was very uh
 		dramatically different that the people you saw than what we see here because you had no minorities you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that's true
 		yeah i think we've probably got it to a lesser extent i wouldn't say we're anywhere close to some of those other places probably like what you have but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it you know they say i guess a lot of the people that they the the gang related things they put them in jail and then they when they get out they just say get lost just don't hang around L A or don't hang around wherever and so they just move on to new territory and where ever they can find easy pickings but
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		you can see it getting a little bit worse and worse it it's pretty sad like you say you see all these kids thirteen fourteen year olds and you know it'll be a school night and they're out at ten eleven o'clock just roaming the streets and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i just never remember that when you know it's been a while since i was in junior high or high school or even elementary school but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you just i just you were never out past eight or nine o'clock on a school night you know if you were even up out of bed you were lucky it seemed like and
 	
 	
 		but of course you you have a lot of parents that are not really parenting much
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true and you know and i think when it come
 	
 	
 		you have that in Utah
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		you have that in Utah
 	
 	
 		yeah its getting worse i you know like i say i
 	
 	
 		because i would think that big Mormon influence there would uh
 	
 	
 		yeah with with that with that Mormon influence it may not be as bad but we still get a lot of the two uh the two parent income or the two income families and and i really think that's a lot of the problem its just you don't get all the the values taught in the home that you used to get
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and the kids are left to to to do their own thing and find their own you know entertainment and stuff and i I really think that's what you're missing we miss a lot of the those good values that were taught years ago to
 	
 	
 		well i i work in an an area of town like my school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		is about seventy five percent Anglo and that's very unusual in the in the Dallas Public Schools
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yo yeah
 		i would think so yeah
 	
 	
 		but it's very it's like the lowest socioeconomic Anglos
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's what in the South we call poor white trash
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then the other uh significant percentage i have is Hispanic
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and course that's growing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the kids that i have
 		the biggest discipline problems with are Anglo children
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and i i've got lots of Anglo children who are just
 		not really wanted by anybody
 	
 	
 		huh not by their families or anything
 	
 	
 		well and for example i have a boy now he checked out today
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he's fourteen he's in the sixth grade he lived with his mother in Mississippi he had been to he thought ten or twelve schools in Mississippi
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sheesh
 	
 	
 		then his mother now his mother and father aren't divorced but they don't live together in a long time his mother had a new boyfriend who moved in who owed so much back child support for his children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that they couldn't afford to keep her children anymore so they sent them here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and here he was with his father and his father's pregnant girlfriend
 	
 	
 		oh jeez
 	
 	
 		and they pawned all his personal belongings like he had a Nintendo and a VCR and some stuff they pawned that
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he's just been tearing my school up and he told me he's gonna be bad enough to be sent back to Mississippi
 	
 	
 		jeez
 	
 	
 		and today they checked him out to send him back to Mississippi
 	
 	
 		huh
 		you're kidding you know and that and it's so sad because you i mean sure it's the kids doing it but you know who really is has the blame for that yeah
 	
 	
 		now those kids
 		yeah but
 		yeah but those kids are
 		ready fodder for gangs
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		the people show them some interest show them some love and
 	
 	
 		sure they belong gives them something to belong to gives them identity gives them importance
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		gives them a certain security
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
