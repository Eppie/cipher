 		i grew up in an area that uh  it was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had
 		a variety of  boats at our disposal um i worked for a camp for a number of years my father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats
 		um speedboats uh you name it they had it and we did a lot of watering  water sports but i think uh the thing i liked the best was uh we spent about a summer
 		couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid thirties and
 		got a new canvas sail for it and had a real huge big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and
 		we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice
 		chambers that keep it afloat or keep it uh upright again this one you had to work with you get out of the water again and get it upright and uh sailing was was kind of nice to
 		learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were attacking back and forth and
 		um more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and uh the storm or the wind was due to the storm front blowing in and soon as the front came over
 		it was calm so you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away  and that didn't always work we often times got wet  but um
 		it's it's a nice nice hobby to have and nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore so things change i guess
 		what are your memories of boating or current
 	
 	
 		um about the only memories that i have of boating um my husband's family had a a motor boat um when we got engaged
 		and they took us out on the lake several times and uh i really did enjoy that i i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything but um we did some water skiing of course and and uh
 		driving around the lake in the boat and and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting um
 		you know they you they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever the
 		the laws were there and if you didn't obey them uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know there were a lot of accidents i guess but um i found the motor boating was real fun
 	
 	
 		it's true
 		yeah i remember learning how to ski oh i guess i was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres
 		and it was uh  it had a lot of um
 		turtles in it and i got all ready to go and i was down in the water and and set to go and a and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back it didn't hurt too much but it bit enough to where i let go
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and the boat went off without me and i reached back there and snatched
 		pushed him away and got out of the water a a while and and uh it didn't even leave a mark it was just a little nibble and
 		so i told everybody what happened and they go oh yeah sure you know and so i get back down in there and and i'll be if he didn't do it again this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		before they took off this time and and swatted him away so i moved over a a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up didn't go very far but i got up
 		and it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me i've i've uh
 		done about all i dare do on skis you know skiing on one and jumping around here and there and i
 		i i know how
 		you can get injured doing much more than that and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just uh can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess
 		so life changes a little bit in that respect  i'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that doesn't have a uh well what they call trick skis they'll allow you to ski backwards i haven't
 		craft managed to get a hold on that uh craft yet but uh
 	
 	
 		that sounds like a real challenge
 	
 	
 		yeah it it'd be kind of nice i hadn't quite figured out i don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what i've seen you just kind of work
 		work your way up to it and turn around real quick you know grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around but uh i don't know maybe someday i'll
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i'll get back to that as after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end uh weekend or something
 	
 	
 		hm
 		well my son
