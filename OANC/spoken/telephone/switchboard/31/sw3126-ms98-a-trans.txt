 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		well now i i have a question for you do you like uh fresh water fishing or salt water fishing
 	
 	
 		okay
 		i like well what i usually do is fresh water fishing i haven't been salt water fishing since i was about ten
 	
 	
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah and i do everything up at Lake Texoma oh yeah i'm a striper fisherman
 	
 	
 		oh you do okay
 		oh where do you fish for striper there
 	
 	
 		oh everywhere wherever those little suckers are
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but uh we camp at the lodge Texoma State Park
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		over on the Oklahoma side and uh but usually when we go striper fishing when i go out for the big ones we travel down the you know where the channel is down the middle of the lake
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh pretty much
 	
 	
 		we usually chase them down through there
 	
 	
 		okay so you're out in a boat then
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh yeah do you ever go up there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i've gone up there camping like at Eisenhower State Park and i've observed fishing but i've never actually fished there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh it's good fishing up there
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so you like to go for striper then
 	
 	
 		yeah of course i won't you know i won't throw anything back
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well the time i went and watched i went over to the uh to the dam and it was right after
 		one of the major major rains that we'd had uh in fact i think it had been over the spillway recently when we went it was back down but uh some of the roadblocks were still up or there was evidence of them
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and people were they really had the gates open
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh that's supposed to be the greatest time to fish
 	
 	
 		big time
 		well i couldn't believe some of the striper that these people were pulling out and there were just people galore for that matter just just everywhere just huge fish
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh yeah
 		oh yeah
 		it's fun well my dad got me hooked on it
 	
 	
 		so to speak
 	
 	
 		and uh yeah oh God pun pun and uh we'd go out he liked to go out about five thirty and you know watch the sun come up every morning and uh boy we
 	
 	
 		all right
 	
 	
 		we knew a bunch of the striper guides and and so we'd follow them and he had a CB on the boat and all that kind of stuff and we'd just follow the channel and when it's you know
 		middle July through late August when it's so hot they stay down real deep all the big ones do yeah follow that channel on up
 	
 	
 		deep in the channel huh
 		i'll be
 	
 	
 		but uh so now my cousin will i make him get up early in the morning and take me out striper fishing and then we usually fish under the bridge at night with the kids and his wife and stuff like that because where we go a lot of times
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		uh the waves are so big i don't want my kids out there because it's sort of dangerous but i love it i love it
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i used to fish go every summer to northern Canada
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and so i i've been spoiled by that uh but i had a string of seven or eight years in a row
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		of uh sort of a close knit group we would just hop in the car and drive straight through two thousand miles
 	
 	
 		oh how much fun
 	
 	
 		and uh we started out fishing out of a lodge and then we started uh either taking our own canoes or renting them
 		when we got there and hitting a few of the
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		you know smaller lakes along the river chain and uh catch Northern Pike and walleye primarily
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and sometimes Lake Trout also
 	
 	
 		oh how much fun
 	
 	
 		so we'd always go the first week in June you know essentially as soon as school was out and everything is all over and done we'd uh we go uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		course one year i went two weeks too early with a friend that was he at this point he'd graduated from college and was in the Army and
 		he had a two week period he he had to work with before he got shipped off to Germany
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and so i went with him in the middle of May and much to our surprise when we got there all the lakes were still frozen  no yeah the first week we were there we just had to camp and
 	
 	
 		oh you're kidding ooh not for me
 	
 	
 		uh we could go on the streams they were open up you know the flowing where the water was flowing but the lakes themselves were still iced over for the whole yeah whole first week we were there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh my gosh
 		ooh
 	
 	
 		but then the next week they were just just like day and night difference we had some rain and wind and it it cleared all the lakes off and uh you know the fishing was already really picking up but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		those were my favorite fishing trips the most serious fishing i guess i've done
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah when i take the kids out like i say we in fact Memorial Day weekend we went up to the lake and uh
 		my cousins have a boat my boat is sitting in my driveway not running and uh so we go up there and we decided
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		that we'd you know go out first we got everybody's tents up and camp made and all that and said come on let's go fishing we hauled in well we brought in
 		thirty three fish and we had thrown a bunch of little ones back
 	
 	
 		good grief
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh so then we had a huge fish fry the next afternoon and we went back out fishing and we caught and brought in thirty three more and had thrown a bunch of the little ones back but we had more fun those kids
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		they've got real fishing poles but they're the little short ones
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it was so funny because i mean they'd just be hanging over the side of the boat mom i think i got a fish i think i got a fish oh it was hysterical but
 	
 	
 		that's incredible
 		boy
 	
 	
 		Jamie's getting to the age now that when i get up and go fishing early in the morning he wants to go too you know he doesn't want to get left behind anymore
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's getting a little difficult to do that but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we love it we just love it
 	
 	
 		well i need to break my kids in they i have a son you know Wesley that enjoys it but he hasn't really caught enough fish to appreciate any fishing so i i'd like to break them in a little bit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		well i have to watch it because Ashley'll out fish her brother half the time and so you know that gets a little sore
 	
 	
 		uh-oh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but where we camp there there's a you know little bit of a inlet where we park the boats and stuff so real early in the morning before it gets hot and then you know right at dusk
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um down in the trees down there boy all those little sunfish come up and they'll go down there while i'm cooking dinner and just start reeling those little babies in and they ha ve more fun with that
 	
 	
 		right
 		huh
 		what do they use for bait
 	
 	
 		oh usually i'll buy them a thing of worms or a lot of times i'll just give them a piece of bacon and they're taught they'll tear up bacon and stick it i mean those they'll they'll bite empty hooks that's what's so funny
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		good grief
 	
 	
 		and when we're out chasing the big stripers we use those perch for bait
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah use the little ones for bait yeah why not
 	
 	
 		yeah it's great
 	
 	
 		oh me
 	
 	
 		but we just love it up there in fact Jamie wanted to go up this weekend with it being fourth of July weekend but uh i can't put the tent up and all that kind of stuff quite yet i'm still pretty sore
 	
 	
 		fourth of July yeah
 		oh me
 	
 	
 		so anyway but
 		have you been um salt water fishing
 	
 	
 		i haven't really done any of that uh and oddly enough uh Jackie's parents live on the the Carolina beach in North Carolina and and we've i guess we went out one time
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and just fished you know from the shore like in the winter you know one Christmas trip
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but other than that that's really been it yeah they uh i've always wanted to actually go out in the boat i think i went out on a a snapper party boat in the Gulf once upon a time but uh and i was i was too sick to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to to enjoy that
 	
 	
 		right
