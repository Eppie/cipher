 
     		
 	
 		okay talk about uh what kind of restaurants we we like to go to and what uh makes us go back and i'll start talking about it so
 		usually i just kind of like uh places that are family style kind of things because it's a a casual atmosphere and you usually get good portions of food and stuff and and uh
 		but  we were in California recently and i went we went to a couple of very uh i guess expensive extravagant restaurants because it was kind of the thing to do and we just wanted to see what it was like
 		and we got to get some real good food more exotic and uh we thought that the service was very good
 		and uh that kind of makes me want to go to those places again even though it is expensive you know like maybe once a year or once every six months go to it or something like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but how about you
 	
 	
 		yeah i i enjoy going out but my husband goes out for dinner a lot with his company you know with his work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's something that i end up kind of experimenting with with my girlfriends or maybe taking my girls out when he's gone and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so we end up usually finding something that's uh quick service and uh that's hopefully economical and uh
 		certainly tastes good i hate to uh pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um  as far as to really go out for an evening though i do like to have a place that's
 		not real real formal but kind of on a formal side just because usually their atmosphere is more on a quiet atmosphere and it's real relaxing and then
 		uh the quality of food is usually kind of is affected by how the mood is set so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i guess my favorite kind of foods foods would be uh the ones that
 		well i don't know favorite is just going out for a good good hearty steak but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i i i find it amazing around here we don't have too many good steak houses it doesn't seem and i i find that amazing being in Texas i'm from another state originally and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i always thought Texas was supposed to be such a good meat state
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it seems to be a tough thing to do is to find a place that cooks up a real good juicy steak so
 	
 	
 		um-hum you know what we have around here too is uh a place where you uh you pick your own meat and you cook it yourself
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		yeah and they they have everything else cooked you know but baked potatoes and all that but you you pick your meat and you know whether it's marinated or or just regular
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh then they have a big grill and you grill it yourself you know and then have all the stuff to put on it you know like if you want to
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know butter on it or whatever or garlic and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		you can you can do it that's kind of interesting it was really good
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of an interesting approach
 	
 	
 		yeah we we thought that was that wasn't too bad but most of the time you know i was really surprised like i say going at these
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		fancier restaurants and and i thought i really liked the food you know it uh it was different because you know you see all these things like you see all these chef's chef's shows and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh and you know i always watched and thought well i wonder if that's any good you know it looks kind of small but actually it wasn't bad at all
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know when they have like seafood dishes uh but it's just kind of kind of sparse with different things put in it that that really uh
 		that really taste pretty good you didn't you wouldn't think it goes together you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh but mostly around here now we just kind of just do family family type of things you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because it's uh it's easier to go with two kids two young kids now
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what we have too yeah and yeah you do have to kind of decide well are we there to get a good meal and and just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		be comfortable as a family or are we looking to spend a lot of time and a lot of money which doesn't work with kids
 	
 	
 		right right
 		yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		so what would make you go back to a good restaurant
 	
 	
 		well i think uh some of the things that i liked were uh
 		uh well i would see the food and whether or not it tastes good uh the service if they're you know courteous or if they just kind of are hasty you know if they just get your order and go and you never see them again or they coming talk you know talk with you a little bit or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 		and do you find that when you have children that it's it really makes uh you can really tell the difference between a good and a mediocre restaurant by the way they treat you with kids
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes i have we have we have noticed that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yes so uh you know if they more you you can tell when they're oriented towards kids now if they bring something for them to play with or to write with something you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to occupy them you can really tell
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the other thing i've liked too is uh now this isn't you don't have this at at family restaurants but uh is some type of a like a a pianist or something
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that will play some music while your eating and stuff and that was that that was kind of neat
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah we have a restaurant over here called Gershwin's that has a piano player always during your mealtime and it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it just makes for a real classy feel and uh it kind of carries over the conversations next to you so you're not concentrating what someone else is saying next to you but i mean but you know at the next table but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just within your own little group so it makes for a nice nice place to go
 	
 	
 		there was two places that we went to one in San Francisco and one in uh in Monterey California
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh the one in San Francisco is the top of one of the downtown big skyscraper buildings and it was really neat because you could had a great view you know of San Francisco and everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh and that's another thing that would bring me back to a restaurant is the view and the one in in Monterey was really nice because it was overlooking the water too
 		so that was that was a couple things that we liked
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but
 	
 	
 		well sounds good
 	
 	
 		okay you have anything else to say
 	
 	
 		no i think we covered everything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay well thanks a lot
 	
 	
 		well thank you for being home okay bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay
 		bye-bye
