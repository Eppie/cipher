 
     		
 	
 		it seems to be a a topic that's gonna probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up but it does seem to be a lot of habits to break
 		i um wasn't raised as a kid on it but my kids are and so they they tended to wanna
 		grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do and
 		we were doing all right there until uh the price dropped out  and they weren't worth anything anymore
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we it took us um
 		almost a year to get a garbage sack full we just don't drink that many so as far as at home use uh we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion
 		of Dr Pepper or something and and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in
 		uh at the time it was still oh about forty or fifty cents a pound and we came out with about a dollar
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		it just really wasn't worth it  yeah so they they realized you know well of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old that wasn't uh that was a big deal but
 	
 	
 		and a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying yeah
 	
 	
 		we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it and then um
 		TI started keeping up with uh cans there so occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there
 		at least it gets back into the system but um as far as a habit at the house uh
 		i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up
 		have y'all got the individual containers yet
 	
 	
 		no i read in the paper this week where maybe i don't know if it was was i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but i it it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that
 		uh i'm not sure all what we're gonna have to do whether we have three separate containers i really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything
 	
 	
 		right yeah it seemed like uh if if i recall it's been a long time they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it they were fine on the green big green containers but uh seems like they said they were just gonna have a bin
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and all sorts different types would go in there and then that they would sort it as as needed it it seemed that there was at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		and that at at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well
 		uh those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting but when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses
 		um the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor so
 		they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		than having a household try it but i i don't know that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house
 	
 	
 		well it'd get messy too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		i i i know other places when they recycle they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh which we're not in the habit of doing i was brought up uh you know long time ago that
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		they didn't even have cans they had bottles and you'd return them to the the grocery store and you'd get your money back and that that was all well and good and they don't seem still be doing that if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i guess this day and age they don't
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they don't do that we live next to a set of railroad tracks and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash you know break them but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh they weren't that successful so there were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day and
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah and they uh people i i think kids don't
 		appreciate maybe the value of money that it's so little that they don't care they can get more somewhere else uh for a good many
 	
 	
 		yeah just a little bit of begging will
 	
 	
 		right they're the the nickels the dimes or what i suppose it might be quarter and fifty cent pieces in these days that they would get they the kids just don't seem to
 		to care that that much about a small amount of money
 	
 	
 		right
 		well i wonder if
 	
 	
 		but now we we did buy a can crusher and we are crushing cans and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety nine cents so i would say in the last three years we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before um it was just easier
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to do that than to open a large  liter bottle and then have it go flat
 	
 	
 		right yep
 	
 	
 		so that's the main reason we're we sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles
 	
 	
 		where do you take your cans
 	
 	
 		well as you say it takes a while to build it up since we've had the crusher all summer we  i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't taken oh i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a
 		a recycling place probably at one of the
 		libraries
