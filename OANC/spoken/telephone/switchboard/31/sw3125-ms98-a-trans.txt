 
     		
 	
 		well Vic you said your professional your favorite professional football team was the was the Cowboys
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		well you know i i could uh pick the uh Chicago team
 	
 	
 		oh you could
 	
 	
 		yeah i got a lot of northern neighbors here
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh they really uh pull for the Chicago what are the what are the Chicago team called the Bears yeah right
 	
 	
 		the Bears right
 		i'm not sure how they'll do this year i don't know who they'll use as quarterback
 	
 	
 		Chicago Chicago
 		right
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure they know who they'll use at quarterback yet
 	
 	
 		right well there's a lot of good teams out there in the professional world and uh course we hope also that the Cowboys do good i know i do and it's your favorite team so why don't you tell me about them
 	
 	
 		well what uh i get optimistic about is just uh the relative age of the team now with all the youth that they've added
 		and sort of a change in the nature of the team to the to more of the uh the the pure athlete type at all the positions
 		um i like them having added a wide receiver with a nice track background that can high jump real high
 	
 	
 		uh-huh what's his name
 	
 	
 		uh Alvin Harper i think out of Tennessee because he was a think he's about six foot three and apparently can catch anything that's anywhere near him and uh
 	
 	
 		Harper um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i understand that in high school he high jumped seven feet
 	
 	
 		i'll be darned
 	
 	
 		when he was in high school so uh he creates a real problem for people now
 		uh particularly probably down in the end zone where Troy can go back there and put one up in the sky and let him go up and get it
 	
 	
 		well is he a fragile uh football player you know they had an end or a a wingback or something like that that would go down the field and and uh he did real good for the Cowboys and every time he turned around he was getting hurt
 	
 	
 		getting hurt i don't think this one has any a record like that he seems to be more of a
 		a a sturdy athlete
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		i know they have lost a lot of their receivers to injuries in the last few years
 	
 	
 		what's the coach's name Johnson
 	
 	
 		yeah Jimmy
 	
 	
 		Jimmy you think he can do better this year than he did last year
 	
 	
 		well he did better last year than most people thought including including myself but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but what about his players uh and their reactions to him and his uh kind of unorthodox professional football type uh coaching
 	
 	
 		well i guess you mean by that that he sort of brings a more of a college atmosphere to it than than certainly than his predecessor
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i really don't know how they they really react to that It probably does him well right now with with like i said the youth he has on the team
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um
 		i think one thing he did this year that will probably pay some dividends is is changing the offensive
 		coach that bring in a new uh offense and new offensive system that i think the so far the players are are uh responding responding well to
 	
 	
 		and Jimmy's going to leave the offense to the offensive coach
 	
 	
 		well that's the theory
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh  and what about the quarterback do you think he is uh going to stick in there and not wind up there with a concussion
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well i don't know whether anybody can for a whole year anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh he is uh he's pretty sturdy but he's got to learn to get rid of it pretty quick
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh well is Cowboys your your favorite team as well or
 	
 	
 		well really in reality uh they are my favorite team uh uh and have been you know back since the glory days or before the glory days
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they used to practice you know right over here uh on uh six thirty five and Coit right in that area
 	
 	
 		right
 		well over there at uh near Forrest i think and uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah right uh-huh
 		and uh it was a dingy little old field uh uh that uh you you would have thought maybe a a high school would have played on and it's all surrounded you know by apartments and businesses and everything i was shocked when i saw it
 	
 	
 		that's the one that
 		i think that was the place that had the looked like corrugated tin fence around it painted blue
 	
 	
 		yeah and it had holes in it and it had big tire on it where the former coach you know uh stood up in there in there and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but i guess uh you know it doesn't take a lot of uh fancy things to make a good football team
 	
 	
 		well i guess not but
 	
 	
 		since they did uh they were America's team you know back then
 	
 	
 		yeah during that time period they sure were
 	
 	
 		and and i don't think they are now though looks like somebody else laid claim to that
 	
 	
 		do you go to many of
 		do you go to many of the games or have you before
 	
 	
 		uh i've been to several games uh in my lifetime however i prefer to watch the uh watch the game uh via the TV tube
 	
 	
 		well i guess i do too really
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i find myself uh when i go to the football games of uh of uh missing a play by talking to somebody in the group
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or a stands a fan stands up or i'm looking at the cheerleaders or the clowns
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and when something does happen i say what happened you know and then course uh you can see it on the on the playback out there uh but back there when i was going i don't think it was that good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or if they had it at all you know
 	
 	
 		right that's right i think i went to more of their games when they were still operating out of uh the Cotton Bowl
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		than i have since they moved to Texas Stadium
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we we have a lake house see and we go out of town
 	
 	
 		course
 		oh that works out nicely
 	
 	
 		and yeah we just go down there and uh watch the game
 	
 	
 		i'm hoping that they'll be successful and they'll have a lot more sellouts and fewer blackouts this year
 	
 	
 		yes absolutely and and uh if the team you know starts off good this year i think that uh they will be a a drawing card and perhaps they can uh return to their former glory days
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know i had people uh all over the world you know that i run into uh say you know they think of one thing the Dallas Cowboys and the movie Dallas
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and so uh i think that uh they will come back and Johnson while he's unorthodox i think he is doing a good job and he's all uh he's all business
 	
 	
 		yeah he is that
 	
 	
 		and he got a lot he got he got rid of a lot of the cry babies uh the people that thought that had it they had it made because uh they were stars
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and he cleaned that out real good and and i'm sure he lost some good ones that shouldn't have gone but
 		in his type offense he was looking for youth and for uh uh uh to rebuild a new team and i think that was the reason why he cut all the players
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think also that oil man that uh that uh owns that oilman and his partners that own the team uh
 		is interested in making a dollar and and they've certainly gone to uh great lengths to you know to bring the team back into Texas for spring training
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and and also to build up the team to try to satisfy the people and the various factions you know uh especially back in the beginning i think he's done a great job
 	
 	
 		well that's n ice
 	
 	
 		what's his name uh
 	
 	
 		oh the uh Jones yeah Jones is his name
 	
 	
 		Jones yeah
 		and uh he's an oilman and he's got a little money behind him and uh and uh so you know the they've got the stadium out there it's a
