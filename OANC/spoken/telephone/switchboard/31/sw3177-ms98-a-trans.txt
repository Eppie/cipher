 		is uh you know government wants to control and and rightfully so in some instances what we do with our money it it does
 		enable them and those who have a good handle on our economic system to encourage investment by giving you a tax break if you invest properly you know things like that i can understand especially for people who are
 		uh young and getting into a knowledge of the economy and and
 	
 	
 		but do we get a tax break for correct investments we get taxed on whatever we make on our investments
 	
 	
 		well i think
 		i think years ago i think it used to i think the concept was good and i think that that those kind of things are all right
 	
 	
 		but we don't have that anymore do we
 	
 	
 		i
 		no not uh not near to the extent that it was
 	
 	
 		i didn't think so they've even cut you know who can have an IRA
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that was to encourage you to save for the future and to you know save for your retirement and now they've cut out you know the amount that you can have in it and that seems unfair
 	
 	
 		right i usually use that as a preface to you know it's okay that the government used to do that or should do that as far as the good incentive good incentive but since they're not doing it as well now i would be more in favor of
 		uh not taxing anything directly in other just do straight purchases in other words if if you want to put a tax on what you buy then revenues can be generated that way
 	
 	
 		but they already tax us i mean where we live  it's eight almost eight and a half percent tax
 	
 	
 		people
 		well
 		right but couldn't they live off of only that or if they took away the other taxes and built in what it took to make up the difference there
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		and the the rationale behind doing that is taxing only purchases if you notice most people tend to spend what they make
 	
 	
 		oh and then some  and then some
 	
 	
 		and then some
 		so then you'd have a tendency to be taxing
 		uh pretty much across the board if you only made twenty to thirty thousand a year you'd probably only spend X amount of that you know a small portion of that on taxable goods you know you still wouldn't tax groceries and you still you know decide whether you want to tax housing
 	
 	
 		are you talking about doing away with income tax
 	
 	
 		doing away with everything except for yeah all forms all forms of it including
 	
 	
 		i don't think
 		well we're already doing a tax on you know a sales tax i don't think that would generate enough money
 	
 	
 		well you'd have to up it to whatever fifteen percent
 	
 	
 		oh i see what you're saying what do you think of just about a a straight percentage um
 	
 	
 		yeah so if you took the money out of one
 	
 	
 		off of the income with no deductions and and no no loopholes and and no gimmes and everybody pays say five percent period
 	
 	
 		well your problem in there is how do you get i mean you get people that don't report income now so if they don't report income then you wouldn't get that percentage
 	
 	
 		well if they're not reporting the income now they're still not paying it so what's the point
 	
 	
 		if if
 		well if if it's left in the hands of the grocer he doesn't care whether you know this guy giving him the money
 		you know pays taxes or not but he's going to have to pay that percentage see what i'm saying
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		well when a guy comes in to you know he's got a hundred thousand dollars and he buys a hundred dollars worth of groceries
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		he pays fifteen percent tax let's say
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and if the poor guy comes in and pays a hundred dollars worth of groceries he pays fifteen percent tax
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so both guys paid it because the grocer was in essence collecting it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and the hundred thousand dollar guy could not in any way hide what he purchased
 		because the grocer doesn't want to hide it for him
 		whereas the hundred thousand dollar guy could tell the government he only made fifty thousand dollars and it's up to the government to prove him wrong
 	
 	
 		oh i see what you're saying but if we had to have an income tax which they're never going to get rid of what about instead of this graduated the more you make the more you pay
 	
 	
 		see so i'm saying there's
 	
 	
 		what about having a straight across the line income tax just a flat thing and do away with all the deductions i realize all the CPA's and
 	
 	
 		right  right
 	
 	
 		H&R Blocks would be out of  of a job but uh
 	
 	
 		so you you tax
 		yeah you tax per body and and then if you made more you got to keep more yeah that's a rational way to do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i never have understood why they don't do that
 	
 	
 		yeah it it does seem
 	
 	
 		and no one can explain it to me
 	
 	
 		it does seem fair it does take away all their ability to control which you know initially they
 		they had some good ideas but they don't seem to be following them anymore
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i don't know i i guess there's never a an answer nobody ever asks
 	
 	
 		that's true that's true not being an economy major i guess they'd never ask me anyway
 	
 	
 		
 
 		they don't ask me at all
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i always thought a straight percentage though would make a whole lot more sense because some of the people who make the most they have so many quote deductions by the time they get through with their deductions they don't pay anything
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i question their i i i just think that they've made it almost a joke
 		all the deductions in the the way you can send
