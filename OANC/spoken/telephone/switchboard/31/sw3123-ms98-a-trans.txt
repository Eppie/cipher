 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay what do you think about the school systems
 	
 	
 		uh well
 		where i live in Plano one of their big things that they hype it within the community is their school system
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh in fact i think that there's some areas of of Dallas and Richardson that are in the those city town city limits but they uh
 		all of the the housing developments adjoining Plano are in the Plano school district and they use that as one of the things that they
 		uh you know that they try to market when they sell homes in that area the fact that it is in Plano schools
 		uh i do have children in that school system uh
 		and have been personally pleased with that uh i'm not sure that it's that that there's that much glory in the Plano schools versus say Richardson and some of the other areas
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		what do you see as being a problem with the school system
 	
 	
 		uh
 		probably the biggest controversy within our school system
 		is the use of the open classroom concept
 		uh where uh
 		all uh all the students at a given grade level are in one large area for much of the day uh segregated you know by teacher but not necessarily having walls between the classrooms
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i've now had two children that are have been in the system in the system
 		uh one who seemed to do just fine in that tap type of atmosphere the other i'm not so sure about because of uh his attention span i think he's a little bit more easily distracted than was she
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and that seems to be the primary complaint uh
 		i think my biggest complaint problem with the Plano schools right now is that many of the schools do not have cafeterias and kids have to take their lunch back to their classroom to eat
 		uh rather than giving them a a break from that area during the day
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and
 		uh
 		that's  i guess i'm a fairly satisfied uh parent as far as the school system goes myself uh
 		that
 		that it really boils down to the quality of the teachers
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and their interest uh in the students individually is going to make the difference versus you know physical things such as the open classroom versus a more closed classroom
 		uh what do you see as problems
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well i don't have children in school and it's been so long since i was in school myself i'm not really sure how to answer that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when uh  i don't know it seems that they're you know that that the difference is between each school i think if it was
 		if it could possibly be standardized a little bit that it would be much easier to to gauge you know how uh a particular group of students was doing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh the curriculums differ so much and i'm not saying that that's bad necessarily but i think it makes very hard to tell where an actual problem is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know you can't really tell from a group of students if it's a if if it's the the teacher that's got the problem or if it's the book that's got the problem you know what the materials that they're using and everything
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that could be causing a problem
 	
 	
 		now in in Dallas i know at least at some of the later grade levels they have these magnet schools that i think were initially set up to address the segregation issues
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and i wondered uh what the real overall effect on education is of those uh i know i have a niece in the Dallas system that
 		is a uh was just elected to go or selected whatever i i think you have to apply and be accepted to these magnet schools but she's interested in the arts and in in particular in dance
 	
 	
 		what kind of school is that
 	
 	
 		uh they call it a magnet school where it attracts kids of certain interest
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		and uh she will be attending i think Skyline Arts Magnet uh or arts and
 		something  magnet school uh next year when she enters high school
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that's kind of a good idea because
 		you know it doesn't it doesn't
 		it doesn't divide people by
 		by anything besides what they're interests are
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's a much higher it's a learning environment if you're group if you're interested in sciences and you're grouped with other people that are interested in sciences
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it seems like it would it would uh it would help
 	
 	
 		now i would think that would would be a good point as well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they they don't have that type of thing in Plano they just have these two gargantuan  high schools
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but i do think they do provide some type of special interest focus i think the later years uh for for students
 	
 	
 		okay
 		what do you think about about sports in high school and about uh the competitiveness
 		i've i've know i've seen in Plano that there's a lot of really vicious competitiveness between the children at the different high schools
 	
 	
 		well
 	
 	
 		and do you think that's healthy
 	
 	
 		oh not really uh i've not been that aware of it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i live on it is somewhat divided by east and west Plano with Central Expressway down the middle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh and i am on the west side but just barely on the west side i guess my kids are younger than that
 		and in they're in the non competitive uh just athletics uh organizations you know your typical soccer and baseball and all that sort of stuff
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and because of where we live uh the teams that my son has been on has have been from both sides of the fence if you will
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		they've drawn from both sides and i really haven't sensed any of that yet i it may become more obvious to me in later on
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think the one of the more interesting things in Plano is that they have high schools and senior high schools
 		which a lot of people don't realize that
 		that ninth and tenth grade go to high schools of which there there are quite a few in Plano and the senior high schools are only the eleventh and twelfth grade
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		now i didn't even realize that at all
 	
 	
 		yeah that's was very different uh they have middle school sixth seventh and eighth
 	
 	
 		um
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then they'll have uh fact they have a couple of huge schools that are actually almost all
 		middle school and elementary school all of those grades in one building
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		well i know they've got a lot of elementary schools
 	
 	
 		for the most part
 		yeah bunch of elementary and they typically feed certain middle schools for sixth seventh and eighth and then there a number at least i could probably think of six
 		high schools
 	
 	
 		well now what is Shepton going to be
 	
 	
 		Shepton is a high school
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		ninth and tenth
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh there's Shepton and Vines and Wilson or Williams and there's Clark and
 		i don't know whether there's more than four i want to say that there are more than just four but uh it's just ninth and tenth grade and then the the two senior high schools are just eleventh and twelfth graders
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		which is a sort of a different concept
 	
 	
 		yeah that does seem kind of different
 	
 	
 		and they're they're just so big i'm a little bothered by that uh just the sheer
