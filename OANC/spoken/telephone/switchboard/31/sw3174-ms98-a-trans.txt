 
     		
 	
 		uh i work at TI and we have um of course started drug testing um  random drug testing here and um i haven't gotten called yet but um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i feel that it's probably pretty it's pretty good
 		if if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs
 	
 	
 		do they feel that way
 	
 	
 		um i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at TI but i think our latest statistic statistic said something like ninety nine point
 		nine eight percent were uh testing negative on all the drug on on all the testing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i i think it's a good idea just because i'm opposed to to the drugs i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it it's uh i don't know i don't really liken it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to alcohol but yet that can be carried to an extreme too so i think it's a good idea and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't know that their job would be at risk because i think they may put them into some sort of a
 		program to get them off of drugs i would think that is that how they do it at TI maybe that
 	
 	
 		right
 		
 
 		right i at TI if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you're put on a program and um you know you go through the program and then
 		you're called like six months after you complete the program program and if you test positive then you're terminated
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well
 		
 
 		i guess i i draw a hard line but you know i would i'm i'm in favor of of that type of thing that um
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you  you have people out there that are responsible for certain things and you expect them to do their job and it it is possible that you know that they can't do as good a job um as they might do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right
 		um-hum oh and of course they can also cause injury to other people if they're if they're not uh you know fully functional
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		mentally while they're doing their job they could cause you know serious injury to other another people um-hum
 	
 	
 		right and you never know they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that  whatever they're taking at the time and and it would be uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know out of the question also i guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds i sub in the schools  so i've you know had a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right
 		oh yeah
 		uh-huh
 		so  right
 	
 	
 		they they talk a lot about drugs there and i think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but you know i think they can test all they want for drugs  you know and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		if they need to do that as a condition for employment and i know many of them are doing it i know my son has had to do it for both Sam's and Wal-Mart and i don't know how many others are
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		doing that and and i think that's good because  so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age and uh
 	
 	
 		oh yes um-hum
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's just a problem that problem no one is sure just how to handle i think
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		you know i think personally i'm for it there's
 		several reason why i i could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing they say runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it
 	
 	
 		really it's that high
 	
 	
 		and yes and oh yeah it's very expensive and um um-hum it's not like a normal urinalysis it's very expensive to run them and um
 	
 	
 		oh
 		i didn't realize it was that expensive
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i didn't get a raise this year because nobody in our company got a raise
 	
 	
 		um-hum just lucky to have jobs
 	
 	
 		but yet their they spend all the money on drug testing and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise so see there you know there's different
 		i don't think that that's that i think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a a yes sir we should have drug testing because there's really a problem and i know that but then i have other views to it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i just i didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period and Sam's and Wal-Mart are are
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		owned by the same people he took one for for uh Wal-Mart for job hiring and then Sam's called him and and  he took another one and i you know i don't know why they both
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		made him do that since it was so close together i can see if
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because you know if it's a thousand dollars that's a thousand dollars they wasted
 	
 	
 		their their's might not run a thousand dollars our from what i understanding here at TI they run close to a thousand dollars an employee
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well maybe they run i don't know you know that's just guessing it maybe they run a lot of other tests or maybe it's under a health
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		type program that it it it would catch a lot of things i i just can't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but no for all the the
 		oh it's
