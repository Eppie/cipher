 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well some of the things i like to do are i like to knit i knit sometimes and i sew
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 		i like to sew sometimes for my kids i i sew clothes for them every once in a while  and i make quilts so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh wow that's the next project that i'd like to learn to do i do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery
 		and i'm i'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch and was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt
 	
 	
 		after a while cross stitch i think i don't know i have to put it away and then i have to bring it back you know and and uh
 	
 	
 		it gets boring
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know why that is i don't know if it's looking at the little things little things every time
 	
 	
 		well it just reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging i think
 	
 	
 		yeah that might be it that might and yet there's uh
 	
 	
 		but i do a a lot of it in the car we yeah we commute from  Plano to Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh do you
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so i have nearly an hour both ways that i can really get a lot of work done and i found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car
 	
 	
 		oh i bet
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know that i could even think about quilting
 		you have to have a pretty good frame don't you to do any kind of quilting work
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		um i've not really done any too much challenging um stuff i i can do it with a a needle and thread you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh and get about five small stitches in which is pretty good but it's very long
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group you're not finishing a quilt in a long time
 	
 	
 		oh i bet but it's such a lost art
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		so um i like to just mostly do the tie quilts that's so much easier
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yes
 	
 	
 		but uh the other ones are very pretty they're uh we have a quilt on our bed that's uh instead of like yarn
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they tied um ribbon into it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it's real pretty that's real pretty
 	
 	
 		i bet
 		there's so many things i wish i had learned to do with my mother she had crocheted a full bedspread it's kind of a hobnail looking thing
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and when i look at it now she's been dead for a long time i think oh why didn't i learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		people just don't know how to do
 	
 	
 		now did you say you could knit
 	
 	
 		no um-hum haven't tried that either
 	
 	
 		oh
 		well i was gonna say because
 	
 	
 		i wanna learn to crochet i
 	
 	
 		because if you could knit you could crochet it's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		to to weave the the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then you just use your right hand with the hook
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and that's not it's really not too difficult you could learn that i'm sure and pick that up if you i think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet it's not too difficult
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh-huh
 		it's funny when you were talking about sewing i love to do anything by hand with a needle
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i'm totally intimidated if i sit down at a sewing machine i never learned
 		and i get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me but i just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew
 	
 	
 		isn't that interesting
 		i think that's really interesting
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		huh and yet you know i think about you know you said you do a lot of needlework and and there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that people do
 		and i i just think that um
 		that's one of one of the arts that i think are real pretty
 		and a lot of people don't do that either
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know and so
 	
 	
 		well it's hard to find the time
 		i i wouldn't if i didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if i sit down i'm doing something with the kids or
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just not sitting down at all
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true you know and and i always think well i can do this while i watch TV or something you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um it seems like i always get my mind carried away to something else and then it doesn't
 	
 	
 		well and i'm at the age where bifocers or trifocals would be necessary and so i find myself putting glasses on to
 	
 	
 		quite work or
 	
 	
 		to watch TV and then taking them off to do needlework and i get frustrated doing that so just give it up
 	
 	
 		yeah and
 		you know i like to sketch i can i can sketch something like if i see a picture like out of a book i can sketch that
 	
 	
 		ooh that does
 	
 	
 		and that's nice and everything
 		but you know it's funny i can't i can't draw it out of my own head kind of thing i wish i could and and yet i can't do you know like like uh craft uh on wood
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i can't do that painting thing and yet
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm the same way if i see something i can copy it but i certainly can't create i admire people that have that in their minds already
 	
 	
 		yeah me too
 		me too i know a woman who's just wonderful at that and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i look at it and you know you look at those things and you wish so badly that you could do them i guess
 		if you wanted to you could take classes and learn i guess that's the only way i could do it
 	
 	
 		well sometimes even with that yeah i i think you have to have some
