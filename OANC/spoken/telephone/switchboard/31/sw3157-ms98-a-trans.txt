 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i guess that's all i do
 	
 	
 		is that it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		okay start them off
 	
 	
 		um well i was thinking
 		how the government has changed over in uh Europe and Russia
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know
 		all those countries becoming democratic for one thing
 	
 	
 		well uh i don't know what your age is but i know when i was growing up that uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i'm twenty seven
 	
 	
 		communism course the big threat of communism McCarthyism back in the fifties and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and everything there we lived our whole life under the fear of communism was going to get us and now
 		
 
 		communism is no more
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that makes a huge difference to us
 	
 	
 		so it
 		uh-huh
 		and then i was thinking about how uh women's roles have changed
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i'm twenty seven by the way i was born in sixty four
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 		you were born in sixty four okay i'm older than that i'm forty four
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 		okay
 	
 	
 		i was born in forty seven so i've got a couple years on you and i can tell you that things
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		things have changed a tremendous amount for women in the world
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		since i you know first started
 		i'm not sure i i'm not sure they're better
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's
 		because we might be liberated but now we all have to work and  support ourselves and
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		but uh it has it's pluses and minuses i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah i feel sorry for women who truly do wish to
 		kind of follow the the older tradition and stay home and raise their family take care of the kids and people say what you don't work
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		it's like a luxury now
 	
 	
 		well yes i work all day long thank you very much
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah it's hard work but it's like you have to have a husband that makes very good money in order to do that i guess
 	
 	
 		yeah the cost the cost of living has gone
 		just sky rocketed
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's true
 	
 	
 		what do you think as far as the
 		social morals the morals of people today as opposed to
 	
 	
 		well like uh my sister's younger than i am and i think that uh  like they're all um
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		uh well of course there's AIDS and i don't have to guess why you know because because just her generation will just like jump in bed with anybody you know
 	
 	
 		i i i really do i feel you know i look back and i have two children i have a daughter who's fifteen and my son is twenty
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh it's scary
 	
 	
 		and i mean it's very scary because they are living in a totally different time with totally different fears
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		than i grew up in
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know
 		five years ago
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		even ten years ago before the threat of AIDS entered
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i think things were people were even possibly more promiscuous
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because you know well it was live and let live and everybody have a good time and we won't even think about the consequences
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess like in the sixties and the seventies i was
 	
 	
 		i think the seventies maybe even the well in the eighties we started getting a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a taste of it uh and people started saying whoa wait a minute
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i don't know i think there may even be a turnabout
 		in the nineties not immediately
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but as people become more and more
 		terrified of the AIDS virus
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i think they're going to pull back sexually
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think they're going to pull back and we may find the pendulum swings you know
 	
 	
 		the other way
 	
 	
 		back the other way somewhat
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i think you're right
 	
 	
 		i i think we it has to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		or our uh we we won't survive our our world won't survive
 	
 	
 		unless they can get a cure
 		unless they find a cure real soon
 		for AIDS
 	
 	
 		uh
 		do you have children
 	
 	
 		no i'm single
 	
 	
 		you're single then you are in the midst of this
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 		yeah  i guess that's why i thought of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		it's a different world for us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		can you think of any other social issues government um
 	
 	
 		no
 	
 	
 		uh do you have any idea how long we have to talk
