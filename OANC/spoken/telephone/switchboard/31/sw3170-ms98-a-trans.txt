 
     		
 	
 		basically um my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases we really don't get into small little purchases if we're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		other than that it's not something that we use a lot of um
 		we may have only two or three versus um i know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or uh up to a dozen credit cards but um ours are just major credit cards that we have and uh use uh
 		use only when when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase
 	
 	
 		yeah is that like Visa and and MasterCard
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		do you have department store credit cards too or
 	
 	
 		uh yeah one Sears
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do um
 	
 	
 		appliances
 	
 	
 		appliances and things like that and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate if you've got the cash to pay for something it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two three month period but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		if it's uh
 		any large purchases um you've got to kind of think about um how much you're going to put down as far as uh payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off so
 	
 	
 		right
 		my my husband and i do basically the same thing but we we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we still pay it off every month if it kills us  but we do it mainly for you know the cash flow what is that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		oh float that's the word float and i often will keep track track of what i've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already
 	
 	
 		uh-huh sure sure
 		uh-huh
 		sure so you know
 	
 	
 		and sometimes just and keep a list and make sure i
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		i don't go over a certain limit especially around birthdays you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly exactly yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 		if we go out to a restaurant oh just to float it or i don't know
 	
 	
 		or if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important too to keep a better receipt of it so yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes my husband has a
 		uh
 		or anytime like a plane ticket or you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		even if we have the i'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that
 	
 	
 		sure
 		oh sure for the month or whatever
 	
 	
 		that thirty days  or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		we have a new one from AT&T and we have you know haven't used that one too much  be interesting that's nice  because you can use it for a calling card also
 	
 	
 		so
 		uh-huh yeah
 		exactly sure
 	
 	
 		it's a MasterCard too so it's kind of fun uh  but you get a lot of junk mail about them
 	
 	
 		sure yeah
 		oh yeah and you always get these preapproved uh credit card things coming through uh your credit is great so let's send you another credit card or it's preapproved for
 	
 	
 		yeah you're such a a wonderful person
 	
 	
 		such such to entice you to get more credit cards
 	
 	
 		we'll give you five thousand dollars up front
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and so you know we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit i mean you know you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff so
 	
 	
 		right do you have uh uh an annual fee on yours or  do you get yours through a bank or
 	
 	
 		uh ours is through a bank yeah we had it a long time ago through a banking system so yeah just a but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i i can't see paying an annual fee for it i mean i almost
 	
 	
 		oh you're already paying them uh if you're if you don't pay it off within that month interest anyway so yeah that's exactly it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so  okay
 	
 	
 		well it sounds like i'm being paged otherwise so that
 	
 	
 		okay all right thanks a lot by now
 	
 	
 		good talking to you thanks bye-bye
