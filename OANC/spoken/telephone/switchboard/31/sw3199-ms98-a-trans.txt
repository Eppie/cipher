 		well why don't you start because you've had more time to think about it if you don't mind
 	
 	
 		okay the things that came across you know they said to make it memorable memorable but i thought first of all you needed to
 		kind of about the same time every year like the same week of the the same month
 		and and then you'd have to send out
 		uh you know good flyers and then mail to all that you wanted to attend
 		and of course food and fun are going to be your your
 		ways to get people there um the ones that i've attended
 		some have had breakfast and lunch and it's been a whole day affair some  of course just have lunch or
 		um also like at Christmas time it'd be a dinner reunion
 		and
 		uh all kinds of events are usually held
 		i've seen talents for  mainly the kids that are there and
 		you need probably information about your ancestors to tie that tie you together
