 
     		
 	
 		okay did
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um all i the scale is from one to ten i think one being um no
 		or i'm sorry is all total control
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then ten as being no control is that what it was
 	
 	
 		oh where would i be i would be somewhere around hm seven or eighth
 		i think for control
 	
 	
 		okay so that would be like less control
 	
 	
 		oh no um
 	
 	
 		i i'm confused but i don't really think it matters but okay more control  okay and why is that
 	
 	
 		more on the uh higher end
 		yeah
 		oh well for one i think criminals um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they uh i mean i'm all for people you know hunting and doing their thing although i don't hunt personally
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i don't either
 	
 	
 		i don't uh i don't own any guns but um you know i mean i've i've shot gun plenty of guns uh target practice
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and um well i mean i've kind of gone out hunting a little bit you know with boyfriends but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		gosh i've never done that
 	
 	
 		it's it's fun but you really have to have respect for the weapon
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh but the thing i'm concerned about is you know those people you know like a seven day delay is not gonna hurt those people it's no big thing um you know because it's it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know recreation whereas the people who are going out to um you know  for crime
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know to rob somebody now i think that's good that they have enough time to check their record you know and it
 	
 	
 		um-hum where it's a like cool down if they're just like in the bad uh-huh i agree um that's why i'm i guess i'm like five
 	
 	
 		oh yeah it's for everybody's safety
 		uh-huh yeah i mean i could be five too
 	
 	
 		in the middle because
 		because like if i like i say if someone tried to break into my house today i would wanna get a gun that day
 	
 	
 		oh well i didn't think about that
 	
 	
 		you know for to help be protected tomorrow or whatever that night
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i wouldn't want some crazy nut that you know gets mad at somebody else and says i'm gonna kill them to be able to get a gun that fast so it's like a double-edged sword i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		yeah it definitely is i didn't think about the other side huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		hm hm but i've never i don't know if i've ever shot a gun i don't
 	
 	
 		hm well i served in the service so you have to
 	
 	
 		oh you have to  that's neat
 	
 	
 		you have to uh shoot a weapon and qualify otherwise you don't pass
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		huh
 	
 	
 		so to speak and uh so we had to zero it you know to your own eye each gun you have to kind of zero to your own eye and how you look at the sights
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um
 	
 	
 		who but you wanted like slightly more rules like
 		um like you're towards the conservative end
 	
 	
 		oh well i'm kind of fifty fifty you know if you know hearing your argument it got i'm just right smack in the middle
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum i was just wondering because like since i've never shot one maybe it's different if you've actually shot one or like you said hunted or you know maybe if i you know had ever shot one
 	
 	
 		oh well you
 		
 
 		well you definitely need to you know have the uh respect for it and you can't just pick up a gun and expect to hit something you know you may be within let's say a foot foot range
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i mean uh  i don't know half a foot to a foot off
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		um just because of your sights and how you look through a sight  as compared to somebody else
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hm what kind of hunting have you done
 	
 	
 		oh uh that was uh i i think we just for small but it was quail i think
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		i mean yeah that was just nothing not not anything like deer or rabbits or squirrels
 	
 	
 		hm um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		hm because like i have friends that hunt  and um but they're like real careful they kill the animal with like one shot so they don't have like a injured animal running around and um-hum
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh well here uh actually about thirty minutes away there was a guy that fired and the bullet actually went through the deer and then hit somebody and killed them
 	
 	
 		hm
 		oh my God
 	
 	
 		so it hit two different targets um and
 	
 	
 		does that have to be like some heavy duty bullet to be able to do that or some real super gun or
 	
 	
 		i don't know it's i'm surprised because usually when a bullet hits something it um
 		it it compresses you know it loses it's shape
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh evidently they had bone fragments of both so um yeah it killed and and they've had several instance right here in Raleigh and it was national news
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and it was a real big thing but uh had several uh one woman was out in her backyard and she had a white glove on she was taking her laundry down and the guy thought it was the tail of the uh deer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		oh my God
 	
 	
 		and shot her
 	
 	
 		did she die or
 	
 	
 		uh i think so yeah there was two or three killings like right one was a school teacher and of course all the school kids uh were upset about it and it made the news so uh
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 		hm
 	
 	
 		you know it's it hit pretty close to home i guess
 	
 	
 		gosh i'd uh wouldn't wanna live near a forest
 	
 	
 		i know i wouldn't even wanna go hiking you know with people out there hunting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh really  are you still in the service or
 	
 	
 		no and
