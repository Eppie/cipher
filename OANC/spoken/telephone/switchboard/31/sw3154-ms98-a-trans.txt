 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 		well let's see well we keep our paper paper bags lined up in the garage for
 		glass and
 		glass and uh plastics and uh we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full i guess we collect milk milk cartons and
 		whatever plastics other plastics are acceptable
 	
 	
 		are are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the
 		other containers yet for recycling
 	
 	
 		no no i didn't think that anybody had those at all yet
 	
 	
 		well maybe they don't i i know that was supposed to be in May and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were
 	
 	
 		right well no i haven't seen any so i i thought that it all had all been delayed several times so i have no idea what they look like and i'm
 	
 	
 		yeah the
 	
 	
 		kind of anxious to see them
 	
 	
 		that's going to be interesting because it's uh  we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is
 		uh i look at our big green containers and i say well they work fine and i keep mine outside the garage
 		so that i don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where uh
 	
 	
 		oh right
 	
 	
 		uh it'll be interesting to see how well that works and i am i'm glad the community is doing it uh it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people
 		uh i don't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago but for me the thing that strikes me is i uh
 		growing up in rural South Dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		would candle them and package them
 		is that uh in the fifties
 		uh you could say we had
 		the recycling going on then that we should have now
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		which was all the milk bottles were glass and you got
 		a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them pop bottles all had a deposit on them
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh of course that they did you know actually we had milk delivered to our house
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		in glass bottles and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass glass bottle in there so uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh you know i look back at
 		at uh my
 		childhood and i'd say you know  they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're we're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this
 		uh throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies
 	
 	
 		right right it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away so i hope that this time it it it stays i mean it's just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to see stacks and stacks of newspapers
 		just to the trash is just amazing so uh
 		you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things oh we collect newspapers too and then take them seems like there's a pretty well there's a pretty pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that's kind of encouraging i didn't know you know i i didn't know if we started to do that i didn't know what to expect
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'll have to say i'm i'm the only one i'm good at at this point is the newspaper
 		uh taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh getting rid of those but on the plastic i have uh
 		i don't have any habits there yet and i'm guess i'm waiting for the city to to push me in that direction but
 	
 	
 		well i guess they will shortly i guess
 	
 	
 		but it just seems like on the larger scale that
 		you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things and i think if uh
 		if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like uh was the case years ago that uh it would have more immediate effect
 		uh than because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window and so
 	
 	
 		oh right
 	
 	
 		outside my little town
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		we would uh go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right do you know i saw in Tom Thumb yesterday i saw the return to the uh the small Coke bottles
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not
 	
 	
 		i well that's interesting because they're back to glass you're saying
 	
 	
 		they were glass they were the glass uh well let's see they'd be i don't know maybe ten ounce or
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		six ounce or ten ounce
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sort of a small size
 		sort of a small size and and we anyway we just we didn't stop and look them look at them a long time but and they were packed in the old sort of six pack
 		stick them down you know uh sort of of sort of a basket type thing with the divisions right right so i just hadn't seen that in a long time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		the carton the paper carton
 		yeah
 		well i mean the you you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood
 		uh racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold uh twenty four bottles and
 		and uh
 		uh i'm not really say going back to good old days but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well
 	
 	
 		well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass i'm i know your husband uh
 		doesn't really like the paper sacks
 	
 	
 		no he doesn't like the paper sacks and uh but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too he doesn't doesn't just
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm the i'm the same way because otherwise
 		uh oh i'm i generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal uh
 		Neal's a person who says i like to pick it up but i don't believe in throwing it into the uh
 		the landfill so i have my compost pile but most of us don't have the uh sufficient lot size to uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to do that
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		uh so i'm glad the city's willing to take that on
 	
 	
 		that's nice i guess they dump it the same place i wonder where they dump that the same place
 	
 	
 		well there's someplace you know if it's because really when i look at what my grass does in in actually about twenty four hours
 		uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally uh composts or stores and uh
 		so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it and it will naturally decompose uh so you just have to kind of keep in separated and then uh who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into but it's
 		it's certainly usable material
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in they have this day now that it's you know  separate from the other trash pick up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		but i the thing i don't understand about that is like when it's one thing to send grass there but i've trimmed trees and other things which uh
 		end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly but it's still natural and i just don't know
 	
 	
 		no
