 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well Hal what's uh what's crime like in Dallas
 	
 	
 		well it depends where in Dallas you are there are certainly parts of town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i would not want to  live in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because it's a situation it is very location dependent
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and there are parts of town here where
 		when they talk about the nightly gunfire
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah in Baltimore we have similar
 		i live on the outskirts of Baltimore and uh we live right outside the city
 		and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though i'm in graduate school uh i live here because it's close to the university but you know we have uh it it's really funny the only crime we really see
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		is uh just the kids being malicious
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know and i think most of that is because their parents aren't around that make sense
 	
 	
 		yeah that uh the what they call the latchkey children
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah something like that no one's you know or or fathers are just missing you know so there's no uh
 		no consistency there in the home or whatever there's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong you know
 	
 	
 		you know the suburb i'm in is more of the upper middle class so i think our uh not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems but on the other hand
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh we get the uh affect of the
 		the city and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the main crimes within the suburb here are the the theft crimes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		a small number of assaults
 		uh well if we have one murder a year
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's probably as many but then you know you go into Dallas and they are unfortunately
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh having murders at a rate greater than one a day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think that's we're about the same in Baltimore though um Washington i think is uh
 		close by and you know they experience a lot more i think they definitely have more problems that uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in in the area what what do you think can prevent crime
 	
 	
 		well uh the thing is i don't it's one of those things where if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on unfortunately there are often these correlations that are
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		inverse of what they should be like uh
 		wherever there are more
 		uh criminals there are more policemen but that's which came first
 	
 	
 		yeah  yeah
 	
 	
 		but on the other side of it is it's it's basically the the problem is within the in the society and the society's views
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh well since now i'm in my mid forties when i was in grad school
 		or when i was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area i thought you know crime was was reasonably unknown and just the situation that's developed with the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the drug aspect of uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i think
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh the pushers the dealers and the addicts
 		um
 	
 	
 		yeah i i i think i agree with you there
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because it just was not uh something back in the sixties that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i even had to worry about but i think you know that
 		there is a lot in the society where things have changed
 		uh so it's effected all of us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah i think they the drug culture definitely has uh is one of the main problems yeah our uh our mayor in uh Baltimore is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should
 		uh legalize drugs
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		because it would eliminate the uh the violence
 		and the uh the under
 		the the market i guess the the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it that make sense he's one of the big proponents of that he gets on national television and and says that you know so it's um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he was a
 		District Attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor so that's a really stranger you know it's a different viewpoint i uh
 	
 	
 		you know in a sense i don't i'm not i have real mixed feelings on that because it comes a bit from the angle that the uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		it would certainly be an interesting test
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but the other side of it to me
 	
 	
 		what happens if we lose worse
 	
 	
 		uh you well the other side is that unfortunately
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		some of the down side and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say you know back then there were the opium dens but the thing is if somebody ruined their life
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		society didn't try to then save themselves from it they let this person
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		who had ruined it
 		uh become well die or whatever i mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 	
 	
 		their life expectancy was real short but now we tend to
 		believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise we need to take care of people even if they have
 		you know physically ruined themselves
 	
 	
 		yeah they have induced it themselves yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		and so to me that's i uh i would certainly like to see a real test of of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then don't use them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh well i think you know they did that in Alaska
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		that that actually Alaska just recently legalized marijuana
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i never i never heard results or anything like that so i never you know plus that's such a that's not a true um
 		you know it really couldn't be a good test because Alaska's so different than every other part of the country
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know so that but that was interesting you know i i don't crime is one of those things that's uh
 		i i don't know you know the drug culture the uh
 		the um
 		you know i i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it
 	
 	
 		yeah well the some of that and of course i'm a baby of the old school but it it bothers me from the fifties on not that i'd remember that much from the fifties but but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah that's true that's true we worked hard for everything that's very true
 	
 	
 		and so you know in the there were the sixty four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties but nowadays there's so much on TV where
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing of course
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i work with lawyers a lot and i see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody
 		and you know there's a million dollars you can have
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh for mental duress or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh in Europe they seem to have mentality and drunk driving is a good one is that people are
 		well indoctrinated their society that drunken driving is unacceptable
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and yeah if you're going to drink and you may drink you better have your designated driver in this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs is
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds
 		the punishment is
 		extreme and we mean it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah that i think that uh the drunk driving has just actually just caught on uh uh and i i i really uh my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school and um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that was a very uh
 		that that was an awful three years afterwards you know of recovery and the difficulties
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh everything we did and you know the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago there was no his father was even the uh police chief of the town
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so there was no repercussion at all
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know other than insurance but he was uninsured
 		so uh our insurance paid for everything but it was a very difficult time and and then later this was actually funny my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a a new car and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and broke all his windows and his lights and his dented it everywhere and they came and questioned us
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know and
 	
 	
 		but that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		was uh misplaced for years that you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yep
 	
 	
 		it was an acceptable social behavior
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah very much so yeah that those are some important points
 		yeah i that's
 		those are
 	
 	
 		what are what does your city have for gun control if anything
 	
 	
 		well see Maryland is one of the most we just voted in uh gun control strong gun control here in the state of Maryland i i think
