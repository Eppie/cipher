 		where do you oh we can't talk about where you work
 	
 	
 		personal stuff
 	
 	
 		uh
 		i'm trying to think of what else i've seen
 	
 	
 		um did you see Problem Child 2  i'm seeing all these sequels
 	
 	
 		no no no
 		well see my problem is um i teach school and so those movies that by the time the kids finish telling me about them i don't go see them yep
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh because they told you every last detail
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh i'm trying to think of what else i've seen um
 		oh what was the one with the guy that had amnesia the lawyer
 	
 	
 		uh i don't know
 	
 	
 		um oh it was so good now it's my names escape me um
 	
 	
 		a lawyer with amnesia who was in it
 	
 	
 		oh gosh i might try to look through the paper and see
 	
 	
 		okay that's a good idea i didn't have a paper
 	
 	
 		oh let's see what we have
 		it was about a doctor who had amnesia uh not doctor lawyer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he was a real hustly bustly kind of person
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and then he got amnesia and
 		sort of slowed down and nobody was used to him he had servants at home and very very rich and
 	
 	
 		hm i have no idea
 	
 	
 		when he went through his thing his whole personality changed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm trying to remember the title of it
 	
 	
 		oh is that that Regarding Henry um-hum
 	
 	
 		yes it was Regarding Henry
 	
 	
 		i didn't know he was a lawyer in the movie i didn't see it
 	
 	
 		okay yeah i thought i'm pretty sure he was and he was like out for everybody's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh huh
 	
 	
 		you know to get everybody and to  swing deals and do things that were
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		borderline he never did anything illegal but
 	
 	
 		so did he change for the better after that or huh
 	
 	
 		yes yes well he wouldn't defend a case because he knew they were lying
 	
 	
 		that's strange
 	
 	
 		and he was the one that set up the lie for them and
 	
 	
 		is that based on a true story do you know or
 	
 	
 		i don't think so because we you know doctors and amnesia case too and
 	
 	
 		hm
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		then i had seen something on television
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i think amnesia was in this year
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 		is that what happened to that movie with William Hurt do you know
 		that he's in now um is that his name or John Hurt
 	
 	
 		what was that again
 	
 	
 		isn't there some movie about a doctor that something happened to him is that the same one you're talking about did he get amnesia
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yeah that was released that was called The Doctor and that was released after Regarding Henry
 	
 	
 		uh-huh did you see that
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but i didn't go see that because i felt like i had enough of one theme
 	
 	
 		already seen it
 		um-hum
 		uh trying to think what else
 	
 	
 		i haven't seen any of the new ones though
 	
 	
 		uh-huh me neither
 		hm well do you think we've talked
 		long enough for the the thing
 	
 	
 		i don't know if we've gotten five minutes in i didn't look at my clock
 	
 	
 		oh is it five because someone told me it was three
 	
 	
 		three let me check my thing bet she's gonna hate us when she has to transcribe all this
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		okay
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay let's see

 	
 	
 		i'm still trying to think of something else i've seen but
 	
 	
 		yeah well i'm looking at the paper and i don't see anything
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		hm
 		i don't i don't see it
