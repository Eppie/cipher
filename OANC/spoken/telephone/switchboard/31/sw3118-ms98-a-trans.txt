 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		okay do you want to start
 	
 	
 		okay um
 		i haven't i don't know that much about the possible what the possible  choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury but
 		um i think it works better than many other systems like having a judge decide
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide although it's difficult because they all have to be new unanimous
 	
 	
 		now that do you do you agree that they should all be unanimous
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		or even even in uh like they said you know lesser you know trials you know lesser convictions do you think that they should be all unanimous still
 	
 	
 		i don't
 		i don't know i don't know if i feel i don't feel real strongly about that if the um the thing is though i i didn't think that  even if it was a lower conviction i didn't think that you could
 		um i didn't think that you really had to have a a jury
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		unless i guess if you request one you can but i think yeah making it unanimous sometimes might um
 		
 
 		let the only thing it might let more people get off i don't think it would convict any more people
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we have so many people already you know the jails are already overloaded
 	
 	
 		well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous i mean if one is determined that it's you know that he feels that he's you know going against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees
 		so i don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in
 	
 	
 		yeah well if it's no but they they what if they never agree doesn't it just um do they have to go back and do a whole new trial or
 	
 	
 		and they have to stay in until they all agree yeah i don't know i'm not sure if they go i mean to twelve new people
 	
 	
 		agree
 	
 	
 		or what they do exactly but i do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either you know either he or she can either go free or to jail either one
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah and that maybe on the lesser
 		crimes that aren't too severe that's a little stringent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		especially because there's twelve the thing about it is i think jury selection too a lot of times um
 		the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury and they can sway them that way too
 	
 	
 		that's just that's just it i don't understand you're supposed to you know go in if you have you know like if you've never heard of the people before or anything
 		but i don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are total totally impartial to it
 	
 	
 		i know i don't think well  i guess you really can't but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um but then again you know they the one of the questions they asked is should it just be decided by a judge and that's kind of tricky too because a lot of positions the judges are in they
 		they can't be fired you know they have to they stay till they retire and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah i agree i don't think it should be left up to the judge alone not only you know that they have to stay in there but hey how many times have you heard of judges being bought over
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		you know so it it's i i i think i think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know um vote i think he can be you know
 		i i don't know if it's the way it is in real life but i've seen it on TV where the juries go one way and the judge totally totally finds it obnoxious and he completely you know goes the other way
 		now i'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i think in some cases they are but they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if it's you know so that's another thing  where they have the power but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		maybe juries could be less than twelve people or would that be more fair or less fair maybe there should be more than twelve people i don't
 	
 	
 		oh oh my God if there were more than twelve can you imagine how long they'd be sitting
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i know i don't know
 	
 	
 		i i think it's just i don't i mean i think it's as fair as it can possibly get but i just think it's really hard you know i mean some cases go on for years you know
 	
 	
 		that's true and i've never been on jury duty but they have to keep going and going and going
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and lose their not lose their jobs but not go to work
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i i don't know how it could be more fair
 		course i don't know maybe maybe they should be asking someone that's been on on trial before
 	
 	
 		it could be
 		really i've never seen one in real life either so i don't have you know i don't know that much about it but i think it seems that we have a a pretty fair system compared to other countries i don't know how we could make it more fair i really don't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the unanimous vote is questionable though and and how how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed too
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		because uh
 		
 
 		i don't know if you should have really really have a jury for small a small
 		infraction
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i'm not sure who gets them i don't know anything
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i know i don't know that much about it either
 		i just i don't know i i guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail you know how they can make it more fair for them or not but then again maybe they should be there so that is fair
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't
 		i i don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way
 	
 	
 		no whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty uh unique i think when they started it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so  how long do we need to talk  do you know
 	
 	
 		oh i think we can hang up anytime
 	
 	
 		okay um in um what do i do now do you know anything or just wait for someone else
 	
 	
 		no i don't know what else to say so
 	
 	
 		okay okay well it was nice talking with you
 	
 	
 		it was nice talking to you too  bye
 	
 	
 		thanks bye-bye
