 		hello
 		hello
 		oh  well i'm glad you found me
 	
 	
 		good well i'm my name's Gail and i guess we have to talk about credit cards
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes my name is Carolyn
 	
 	
 		okay well if you're ready then uh
 	
 	
 		okay i'll just let you start
 	
 	
 		i'll
 		okay i'll press one
 		
 
 		okay well i'm not  this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me because credit cards are my downfall
 		i just find it so easy to to charge something when i don't have the money to pay for it and really trying to get out of that habit so
 		i think they're kind of dangerous
 	
 	
 		i think they are too and unfortunately um
 		we use ours in we don't use them all the time but we use them like at Christmas time and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them
 		like that  but um i would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		yeah me too
 	
 	
 		i think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them
 		um that's what gets to be the really scary part you know if you think
 		when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year you could really
 		get a lot more stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if you were just able to pay outright for it
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true that's true seems just like our society is so um
 		pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this they're really trying to get you into that uh situation because they know they've really got you then
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah all i know is some of my credit cards like um
 		we have a Sears one and we always get a maintenance agreement every year and it's just easier to say you know just put that on my credit card well that's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		probably four or five hundred dollars you know that goes on
 		at that point and then it seems like
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		takes forever to pay that off
 	
 	
 		it's funny that uh we've got a Sears card and we bought a washer and dryer on it four years ago
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and we still owe i mean i i think like half  of the amount that they cost in the first place
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		it's just uh you know you just never never get get it out
 		and uh that's that's real irritating to have
 	
 	
 		it sure is
 		we eventually did one time we just borrowed you know took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards
 		and the interest on the loan was cheaper  than it was you know to just have that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we haven't done it lately we probably need to do it again
 	
 	
 		well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said sure we'll give you a personal loan it was only a thousand dollars that we needed
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		for the truck and they said sure that's no problem but you know why don't we consolidate your bills
 		and at the time we thought oh that would be great you know we could and it's gonna be a lower payment than it was for all of them you only have to write one check a month not all those you never miss one or whatever and we did that but we didn't realize at the time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh until several months later that
 		we we were real i mean this was four year three years ago we were
 		pretty young and we were just kind of like well i guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didn't you know about six months later we realized we could use them and so we charged them all up again
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		yeah so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment problem  so we were paying like twice
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um  so we didn't ever made that mistake again luckily  but uh we're
 		definitely working on not doing that credit thing we just as a matter of fact this it's real interesting the subjects i get they always seem to be so pertinent but we just discussed this last night at church talking about debt and things like that i just it's so
 		so alluring and uh so easy to get uh sometimes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i know they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh if you could stick to that you know we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion  and everything else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		yep
 		sure that's true oh i just picked up my daughter and she was eating a cupcake and there are crumbs all over her yeah what a mess you are
 	
 	
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		oh so i don't know if i if i i just feel kind of i my big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card and i just thought
 		you know if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something you know and we had to had to buy one and we would really need that and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so he said okay we'll keep it and then we weren't smart enough to not use it so
 	
 	
 		you know one thing you might do with in a situation like that though it's just like keep
 	
 	
 		now we just don't
