 
     		
 	
 		where is your favorite place to go
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well we haven't traveled outside the United States that much um we usually take family type vacations we're looking forward to one in October to Disneyworld in Florida
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's great have you ever been there
 	
 	
 		a have a nine year old  when when both of my kids were much younger and this time we're gonna be going with just one daughter and she's nine so it ought to just be a ball
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh that's a perfect age for Disneyworld
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i think so too
 	
 	
 		oh that's great yeah so we've been there a number of times and uh we're going next year we have a business trip every fall well we go on a lot of business trips i
 	
 	
 		oh wonderful so you travel a lot
 	
 	
 		i don't work well we do we go my husband travels a couple times a month and in the position he's in they don't care if i go along
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it's great i just kind of join up when it's something interesting and uh Disneyworld is the one for a week next year
 	
 	
 		sure
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and it'll be at this time of the year and this year we're leaving um uh matter of fact we're leaving next Saturday for New Orleans
 	
 	
 		oh that'll be fun too yes we went years ago we haven't been lately and i know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything but we used to have a lot of fun there
 	
 	
 		have have you ever been there
 		well you know we went there once in fact we had been in Dallas and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said let's go to New Orleans so when he said well this year you know i have a week there on a
 		a project he's going to be and then i said well i'll go along i hope it's swimming season because it wasn't a tremendous thing not amount of things to do that i wanted to do there
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		yeah if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping there isn't much there but that can be fun
 	
 	
 		it well and and that's probably we do like the night life to an extent and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i'm kind of anxious for that but um yours to Disneyworld sounds  a little bit better
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		did you know that next week there's several TV shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary
 	
 	
 		no i know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows
 	
 	
 		well and with a daughter nine it is just she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind
 	
 	
 		yes be excited about all of it
 	
 	
 		uh if so uh well if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go
 	
 	
 		well not really uh we're doing the same thing tying it in with my husband's business trip and i just save vacation for things like that and uh just travel whenever we can
 	
 	
 		oh that's
 		well i really i think travel when i heard my topic today i thought okay that's my favorite that's my favorite because
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how easy
 		right
 	
 	
 		and really at our point of life our children are grown and um it has just worked out really well with this um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		position he's in because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where he's going
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		whether or not i decide to go along but i do do like to travel and it's um i don't mind the pool life at all during the day and i like to sightseeing and i love to shop
 	
 	
 		sure
 		
  
 		um-hum
 		um-hum  so that's perfect what more could you ask for
 	
 	
 		so it's
 		that's right but if this
 	
 	
 		and then get to pick and choose the places
 	
 	
 		well and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas um that i would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas um probably once every maybe year and a half
 	
 	
 		ah
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with Continental
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of Continental and i said now that we have all the miles we better start using them
 	
 	
 		right it's kind of shaky
 		that's true it really is
 	
 	
 		uh so we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for
 		just kind of a quick trip um when we normally go that way we like to go to California at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from Texas
 	
 	
 		um-hum our last big trip we drove through New Mexico and Colorado and went to the Grand Canyon and and uh
 		back through Silverton and Durango and oh it was fun it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it our
 	
 	
 		i think that's a good trip and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		now we did what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio and it takes a while just to even get to the
 		what i would call the more picturesque part of the country we will fly to something like once we flew to Colorado to Denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through Utah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and as far west as Las Vegas and then we returned through uh New Mexico that you just mentioned and it was oh it was just great
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh there's so too much to see really you just
 	
 	
 		oh i i think that's that's the way to
