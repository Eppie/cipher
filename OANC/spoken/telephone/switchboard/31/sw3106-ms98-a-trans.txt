 
     		
 	
 		hello
 	
 	
 		hello
 	
 	
 		this is Marilyn Spivey Richardson Texas
 	
 	
 		uh Marilyn it's Angela
 	
 	
 		i knew that was you  well this should be a good one your mother will like it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		how funny
 	
 	
 		let's see now what do i do push
 	
 	
 		push one
 	
 	
 		push one okay hold on
 		
 
 		okay are you there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well do you subscribe to any magazines
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yes
 	
 	
 		which ones do you
 	
 	
 		uh Soap Opera Digest is one
 	
 	
 		oh how many soap operas do you listen to
 	
 	
 		and
 		uh just two mainly
 	
 	
 		oh and so you can keep up with when you miss with that
 	
 	
 		yeah well it was a special thing it i think it was like a free subscription
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		that you got to see if you'd like the magazine and you would renew it at the end of it i never did but
 	
 	
 		oh i see do you subscribe to any others
 	
 	
 		but we take Consumer
 		yeah i Consumer Digest
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		now we do like that one
 	
 	
 		now what do you find out in that because i haven't read that one
 	
 	
 		it it has all different kinds of uh tips on on
 		like appliances and TV's and VCR's and cars
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just different things that you buy and and what the latest items are out and stuff it it's real informative
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then People magazine
 	
 	
 		okay well i only subscribe to two one of them is People magazine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh that usually has the latest oh people in the world  very interesting and then i subscribe i bet you know what this one's going to be
 		to the National Enquirer  because it's good light reading some of it i wouldn't believe but i but it's interesting reading and believe it or not there are a few interesting articles in it too
 	
 	
 		yeah i'd forgotten
 		yeah they're i've i've bought it a couple of times that or one of the other ones like that one you know after reading the front page there will be something that just catches my eye and i'll go ahead and buy it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		because sometimes like you said not all of it is believable and if you use your own judgment you can usually decipher what is and what's not
 	
 	
 		well it's good light reading and since our business is at the house i when i'm eating lunch i like to read one or the other you know comes in the mail once a week and and that's what i read when i eat my lunch
 		but i  really don't read that many i never do buy them you know like when i'm at the grocery store magazines much i guess pretty much after that it's the newspaper and just books
 	
 	
 		do
 		yeah yeah i don't i don't buy
 		i don't buy then at the store either i can't even remember the last time i bought one at the grocery store in a long time
 	
 	
 		yeah i used to years ago read like Ladies Home Journal and McCall's and some of those but i
 		i just kind of stick to these two now but uh you know because they come to i do subscribe and they come once a week so you know they're and i don't really have time to read anymore
 	
 	
 		right
 		what don't you like about the magazines
 	
 	
 		what you mean the two that i subscribe subscribe to
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh oh well now i i guess i just pick out and read out of both of them what interests me there's an article about
 		something way out in the National Enquirer or something i just you know i just don't read it i just read the ones that sound interesting to me usually about movie stars or famous people
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i
 	
 	
 		i been reading all the stuff about Ted Kennedy
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i don't like all the advertisements and some sometimes it seems like the magazines are full of more
 		advertisements than they are anything else
 	
 	
 		yeah now that that's true there is a lot of those i don't pay any i don't read those much either
 	
 	
 		i don't either it's just you have to turn all those pages to get finally to the story you were reading
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		when it's interrupted
 		but i like People magazine too
 	
 	
 		yeah uh uh although it's getting rather expensive since on the last time i had to
 		uh subscribe for a year it was like seventy five dollars and i'm  this will probably be the last time
 	
 	
 		yeah it is getting real expensive
 	
 	
 		i'll just buy the ones off the newsstand then once a month or something when there's something i'm especially interested in reading about you know
 	
 	
 		yeah or get somebody in the neighborhood to to do it and then everybody pass it through
 	
 	
 		yeah that's probably what we should do like they they do books  that way you know so uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		okay so does your mother still take People magazine
 	
 	
 		they didn't renew their subscription because of that
 	
 	
 		cost measure huh we all have to have those every once in a while
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well i think we're just going to do like you said just take the ones at the newsstand that that look interesting from now on because seventy five dollars for a magazine that's just that's too much that's
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 		they're all so much more than they used to be years ago years ago i think people read a lot more magazines
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh
 	
 	
 		i don't think people have time to read them anymore
 	
 	
 		well that's true
 	
 	
 		it's just usually the newspapers and
 		and then they're off doing their own thing
 	
 	
 		that's true
 	
 	
 		weekends and stuff are pretty full and that's about the only time
 		people seem to read on the weekends
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		because mainly i i'm like you i read books
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and and it's it's more as i can think more people do i think just read books
 	
 	
 		more
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so
 		well let's see if you were going to subscribe to a magazine which one would you pick other than the ones that are you reading
 	
 	
 		um
 		i don't know i i'm i just i don't i'm not that interested in the magazines it you know other than like People or this Consumer Digest and the reason why we got that one was
 		you know it has good informative things in there for things your gonna be buying at at one time or other and you can save them and it's got like tax tips in it and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		maybe the the other one there's one out that's that has to do with with financial things like how to save money and and what bonds and insurancers and stuff like that to buy that we've got we had a
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sample subscription to that one and that one was was good too it had a the article the one that that uh was a sample one had an article article in there about college
 		saving for your children and what to do and what not to do and how much the uh uh projected cost was going to be by the time like mine reached college age and stuff
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and it's going to be pretty darn expensive and and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about putting
 	
 	
 		starting to save now
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah like those E-bonds there's something called an E-bond that you can buy and it and it you don't have to pay taxes on it and it's for the child and then when they turn it in when it matures
