 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah it seems like we have cable and there's never anything on we just have more of nothing
 	
 	
 		i can't afford cable

 		i'm in Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		okay because yesterday i got somebody in North Carolina
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um before then i think everybody was in Dallas
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		so hm
 	
 	
 		no we have to have cable because we're up in the mountains and you can't get anything
 	
 	
 		oh huh that's interesting
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but there's nothing on TV ever hardly
 	
 	
 		huh because we have about a zillion channels here in Dallas
 	
 	
 		oh we we can't get anything we can get like one
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		without it
 	
 	
 		God that stinks is it like a rip off or cable or not not is it reasonable or
 	
 	
 		it's all right i don't think it's that bad
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		but there's never anything on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's just background noise again
 	
 	
 		hm
 		my mom's from Pennsylvania
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		um-hum what part can you um-hum
 	
 	
 		right in the middle
 		yeah Center County
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		yeah we don't have any TV stations in this city so they're all from other cities
 	
 	
 		become
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		hm
 		well
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess we watch a lot of CNN too
 	
 	
 		huh that's the news station
 	
 	
 		yeah but it always repeats like every half hour so we watch the same thing every half hour
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		that's like Good Morning America i think if you watch it long enough i think they repeat at least like the headlines
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and
 	
 	
 		yeah after like an hour or so you just watch everything again and again and again
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum well at least you know the news real well
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and people think are impressed by wow  how do you know all this stuff
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah then you get sick of watching like man not this story again you don't pay attention to anything
 	
 	
 		huh
 		uh-huh
 		huh
 		um trying to think of some other shows do you like The Three Stooges
 	
 	
 		no i like Laurel and Hardy though
 	
 	
 		really because a lot of guys like The Three Stooges and they drive me crazy
 	
 	
 		yeah i never got into them much
 	
 	
 		huh i know how about cartoons do you like to watch cartoons
 	
 	
 		yeah i like the Road Runner cartoons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		my sister loves anything like that Bugs Bunny or
 	
 	
 		yeah they're not on that often though
 	
 	
 		hm
 		and um
 	
 	
 		least not around here
 	
 	
 		hm
 		i like uh i used to like Pee Wee Herman before they took it off
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess no one will be watching that anymore
 	
 	
 		Pee Wee's Playhouse
 		uh-huh
 		well they said he might do something else now like branch off a different way like maybe more adult humor or something
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what he started doing anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh i like that stuff i mean he was always a pervert you know it didn't surprise me when he got caught you know doing that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i wasn't too surprised either didn't look like him though
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yep
 	
 	
 		all the pictures
 		yeah i've seen that show twice and it was the same one both times
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i guess i never will see it anymore
 	
 	
 		yeah because they're repeats now or they were repeats before they took them off
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
