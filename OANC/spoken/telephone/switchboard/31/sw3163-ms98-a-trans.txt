 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay well originally i guess women were um
 		in the house cooking and uh cleaning and all that good stuff
 	
 	
 		taking care of children
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh actually the children they they don't have as many children these days
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		because they've gone out to work and they're um  uh well the families of shrinking the divorce rate is up um they're
 		still trying to get the pay that uh the men get
 		um i guess even farther back um they uh used to not even have sports for the women
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh then the women starting wearing the tennis shoes and playing sports and going out to work um
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well i i was thinking too in terms of of in terms of this you know the education is so different i think women are so much better educated now than they used to be and i think that makes a big impact on what women do
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 	
 	
 		um also i was thinking the the clothing has changed so dramatically uh you know you like when you said with sports i thought well it was so limiting because of their clothes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they weren't allowed to to wear certain things and so then they couldn't participate you know they couldn't participate in sports because of it so um i thought that's that's made a difference uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah well it's kind of ironic they're also  these days they're trying they're working their way back into the house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're trying to have the best of both worlds
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they're just now figuring out in the Nineties that it's not quite working
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they can't have both
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so um i guess they'll have to make a choice
 	
 	
 		well i think so or spend part of their lives doing one thing and part of their lives doing another you know it
 	
 	
 		right they'll just have to allocate that time
 	
 	
 		yeah uh because you know because really it isn't that long a period of time that you have to be home with children uh comparatively speaking if you look look through your whole look at your whole life um
 		and i do think there's real value in being in the home uh i do sort of both but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know it it is it's an interesting topic i the thing that's been hard for me to believe too is that how long how short a time it's been since the women had the vote and that's always been amazing to me
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that that's been a relatively short period of time and i think that made a major impact on women's roles uh you know from that point on
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum
 		well i guess the men have definitely figured out that women are as smart
 	
 	
 		i
 	
 	
 		there's a considerable amount more
 		um there's a considerable more amount of doctors these days than there used to have been and of course you like you said they're more educated
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and um
 		uh we've we've uh brought quite a bit to the world
 	
 	
 		well and it will be fascinating to see within the next twenty to thirty years how that changes even more i think the impact will be felt more and more as as better educated women come into the work force
 		um and more and more women come into the work force um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i you know it it's going to just change things drastically i think
 	
 	
 		well some women are actually leaving the husbands home with the kids
 	
 	
 		that's right  that's right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and well i don't wanna talk about the husband's changing roles but they're all they're learning to cook now and to do the laundry and uh all of those good things
 	
 	
 		well i think that you know that one of the things that may come out of this is to let people do what they're best at you know some people uh may men may stay home with children better than some women may and so whoever
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know whoever does which role best i think should do it  um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if if people can compromise and do that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that that takes a lot of
 	
 	
 		yeah it's no surprise that uh movies like Dances with Wolves have come out in the Nineties
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and their influence uh with the men
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh the changing of roles actually
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh that was a very good example of women in the Nineties and
 		what's a real man and a real woman you know they uh they do a little bit of both um the hard labor and uh
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know the smart the uh all brawn and no brains on both sides
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right
 		well  i think that's all i have to say do you have anymore nice talking to you thanks bye-bye
 	
 	
 		okay well it was nice talking to you okay thank you bye
