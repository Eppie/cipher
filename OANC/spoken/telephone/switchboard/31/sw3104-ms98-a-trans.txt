 
     		
 	
 		uh well let's see
 	
 	
 		how many you said yours are all i mean that sounds like an army
 	
 	
 		
 
 		five
 	
 	
 		oh lord
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		that is an army i came from a family of six
 		and i have only got two and they're one
 	
 	
 		well any number is nice let me tell you
 	
 	
 		well i kind of decided that single single children that that
 		that's not parenting that's a hobby but
 	
 	
 		yeah it's not as fair to the children either i don't think
 	
 	
 		well don't tell that to all my friends
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they're into quality time i'm just into getting through the day
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too
 	
 	
 		well i i can i can spot a kid who really you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day and when i take care of some people's kids you know when they when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends' kids
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that are usually in day care and you can spot them because they have no idea how to just hang out and mess around
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you can tell
 		how to just entertain themselves
 	
 	
 		yeah really
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		it's a problem for any child and you take one that's used to being
 		uh busy being having something to do all the time it makes a big difference
 	
 	
 		it's not a problem for my two they're only eighteen months apart
 	
 	
 		uh keeps you busy
 	
 	
 		they can
 		they can find things to do and mess around and and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		plot and scheme and everything else so you did all five of yours complete college
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well that's great
 		no our last daughter she didn't want to go to school she's uh but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and
 	
 	
 		well how did you go about selecting a college then
 	
 	
 		well we didn't do it right all the time with our first boy we persuaded him to start here and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home i think the main thing is to uh
 		right now i feel the main thing is to look at what they're interested in uh and take what they're interested in and then then start looking for schools
 	
 	
 		do you think that what they say that they are interested in is at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at
 	
 	
 		no not necessarily
 		and but like our oldest boy i think he would have he wanted to go to Embrey Ray Riddle and we talked him into going local here first
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh he went to aeronautical uh oh just learning to work on engines and that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is  and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally
 		and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing uh but but right now of course he's he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut and they build and rebuild uh jet engines
 	
 	
 		how about the other four other three who went
 	
 	
 		uh the other ones uh the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to uh we didn't want her to go but she went to Erie to Gannan University uh or Gannan College i'm not sure which it is college i guess
 		uh she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she didn't like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion
 		because it uh saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and our other uh two boys they went to Clarion also and uh did very well there
 		and they've all really got uh
 		they've all really got really good jobs
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go Daphne never went she always said she would never go to college
 		she said i i always thought she'd change her mind you know but she didn't and there's nothing wrong with that you know if college isn't for everybody
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh it it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think it's what they want out of life
 		because if they get an education
 		and are willing to go where the jobs are
 		they can make a you know a much better income
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like my kids they're all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state
 	
 	
 		yeah i was i was making more than i was making three times what my father was making as an executive in the insurance industry when he retired
 	
 	
 		you know that boggles my mind
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		okay did you go to college
 	
 	
 		yes i went uh four years undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where where my parents lived and there really
 	
 	
 		you did see it makes a difference
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there really wasn't a choice i mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i kind of i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and the whole bit um
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		my parents didn't even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it if i had known
 	
 	
 		someplace else
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how not i'm not going to say easy but how
 		much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a uh
 		scholarship to go anyplace else i think that i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		would definitely you know have gone now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go to the Harvard University in Boston and that was uh i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened i mean i was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's great
 	
 	
 		taken out of my element you know the the the homogeneous Midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		
 
 		uh-huh
 		different life styles yes yeah
 	
 	
 		different life style and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		now my kids i keep saying that uh you know i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know you know what the realities is going to look like you know we're putting money away already uh but i really think it's important to put these children someplace where in addition to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know them getting an education they really need a a you know a socialization away from what they are raised in especially if you lived a pretty insular community and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		an upper class suburb of Dallas let me tell you
 	
 	
 		it's quite a bit different
 	
 	
 		it's very different
 	
 	
 		see that's the way w e are we're more of a rural type of a area
 		and it does make a difference
 		i they say you shouldn't look at the expense of the college when you are looking
 	
 	
 		you should not
 	
 	
 		yeah not really because they say a lot of times you get more help
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		with a more expensive college
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		and so in the long run if it's really what they want
 		you know they're better off now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school uh we we did all we could
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go
