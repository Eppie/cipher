 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay uh well since i initiated the call i guess i'll start off first uh number one i have absolutely no problem with random testing
 		uh i spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job and i feel
 		i would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for particularly airline pilots and the such i'd feel much more comfortable than i do now based on what i've been hearing in the newspapers
 		so i really don't have a problem with it
 	
 	
 		yeah uh i don't either i uh i've never worked i don't work at home right now i stay home with my children um but my husband works and they do have that at at his place of employment and
 		neither of us have a problem with it we've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and and such it's uh it's a scary thing to know that uh you just don't know what people are doing uh before they go to work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so and the the advertisements on television lately have been so um there've been so many you know there's uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		just about like train train train wrecks and things like that that i feel like probably just for our own safety and when we're traveling and things that would be something i'd like to know that's going on
 	
 	
 		yeah i well i happen to be uh my job is i'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world's largest paint company
 		so i it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause this type of thing  and even in our field we have people that are in
 		very high risk jobs and we at the present time do not have random testing and i am pushing towards that i i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		they shouldn't have a problem with it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and if they are trying to hide something then i have to know that because we're talking we're talking
 		major liabilities not only with themselves but with other employees
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i really you know they they're talking about sports
 		sports personalities and all this type of thing but i would much much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		on a random basis i i have a real fear of that at some point something's going to happen and they're showing it with AIDS so why you know they should they ought to start doing something with the drugs  so i really have no problem with it
 	
 	
 		yeah well it's it's unfortunate i think that everyone doesn't have that opinion um some people just yeah i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that but uh
 		in the long run it seems to me it's kind of like what they keep talking about the um the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that you know they feel that's not fair and whatever but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		you know those kind of things too i'd like to know myself it wouldn't be in my opinion i i've had a lot of dental work done and the last dentist didn't even use gloves at all so
 	
 	
 		yes
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		that kind of yeah and uh so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me um but
 	
 	
 		well that scares me because if this that's the way they are
 		i if i were a dentist i'd wanna be protected too
 	
 	
 		well you would think so that is  because well and i worked for a dentist and that's uh you know you you come in contact with a lot of of blood and things like that and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's real real dangerous i i would think but with all the accidents
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		just with with uh everything happening  just airlines just drive me crazy people are afraid to fly now you know just because they don't know what their  pilot's been doing and and things like that and
 	
 	
 		right
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well you where you're located i i do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i think they've had it for several years and their program they had i don't think had a lot of uh problems
 		associated with it but uh my brother-in-law happens to work there and it it sounded very positive and i i think it's great i i would like i would encourage it i'm pushing our company towards that and also
 	
 	
 		well and you know if they do find someone who who is uh having a problem with drugs then they can get them the help that they need as opposed to just letting the problem go on with without any uh support
 	
 	
 		right
 		exactly
 	
 	
 		and and whatever because a lot of people seems like would probably obviously are trying to hide that uh from their employer and friends and family and things and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		too many people are just dying particularly in our area i don't know what the crime is like where you are but the crime rate here is just astronomical
 	
 	
 		right
 		ours is changing yeah ours ours is changing it's increasing i live in a  i live in a very nice suburb and it's it's it's unbelievable what what what's going on and
 		the drugs the selling of drugs it's just it's just too loose it's too free
 	
 	
 		um-hum i just got a piece of paper the other day uh that now they have these i i have two little very little children under two and i got a piece of paper from from my husband's office it's talking about these uh drug tattoos now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		really
 	
 	
 		that they have got that look like it looks like a sticker and it's for kids
