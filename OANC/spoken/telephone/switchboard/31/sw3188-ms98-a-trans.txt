 
     		
 	
 		so have you done any painting projects lately
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah this is a great topic for me because i just did my first two painting projects ever it was not not a big deal
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh really
 		what kind of painting was it
 	
 	
 		two little deals the first one um i helped someone repaint an apartment and it was  very easy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it was it
 	
 	
 		yeah and i've never painted anything i always thought it would be so you know you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something but i know i can do it  and the second one was i bought some toys at a um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh huh
 	
 	
 		at a craft fair they're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a a little girl for Christmas and so i just decided to paint them and that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh well what kind of paint did you use for the um bookends
 	
 	
 		well it's uh it that's half the problem right there is that it wasn't it was a oil base so i had to get and when i painted them i
 		didn't realize that we didn't have any uh turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house so i had it had it all over my hands at first i didn't realize you know i had never painted anything so i didn't realize that i needed that i mean i kind of knew in the back of my mind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so you can't use oil on wood
 	
 	
 		well no you can use it on wood but i just had it all over my hands and i went to wash the brushes out and uh wash my hands and you can't wash it off with water you have to get the uh a solution
 	
 	
 		oh  so you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway
 	
 	
 		and
 		yeah i had to drive to the store yeah i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and right back and everything like that and then um
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh downstairs in the in the apartment i just used we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on you know if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean up
 	
 	
 		oh is that what you usually use in the house is latex
 	
 	
 		yeah and and it it just like the same with the toys it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it you know it says safe for children and all that
 	
 	
 		hm
 		uh-huh yeah heard about that i guess a friend of mine had a uh um well she she just started up a day care center
 		and uh and the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh she had that done but uh
 	
 	
 		have you painted anything recently
 	
 	
 		well um so to speak i had to paint this uh the inside of this warehouse thing uh that you keep some um farm equipment in
 	
 	
 		wow was it huge
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and um what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer
 		and uh i had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner i mean i you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh you just took a roller and put it on there and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed so
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it used all of it i guess it was about three hundred yards worth so well i guess it worked out it was pretty easy actually
 	
 	
 		yeah i think though um we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work because i don't know if i could you know i don't know i don't know must be difficult
 	
 	
 		well what about the trim in your house did you have to do that
 	
 	
 		no it was just it was really easy i just like what i we had a couple of different size brushes and it was
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know real easy i went around the trim and if it and there was wallpaper like i was doing just doing just the trim of the around the doors and windows and there was wallpaper and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		if we got it on the wallpaper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried it came right off so there was no major mistakes there was
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		did you have uh one coat or two
 	
 	
 		uh two actually um and it there was um you know around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that but that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that would be really time a a time saver
 	
 	
 		well yeah if you just  you know we didn't tape anything we weren't that careful but it wasn't you know i don't know it's it's funny it's like if you just go slow you don't get or at least i didn't get that many
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		mistakes i didn't make that many mistakes
 	
 	
 		um-hum oh me i would've had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges and and then i'd have probably rolled it on i'd uh it would've taken me forever
 	
 	
 		
 
 		why just because you'd be afraid to do it or have you done it before
 	
 	
 		yeah well the first time it'd probably would've tooken me forever so
 	
 	
 		well it wasn't if it was my own i would've but my friend said oh just go ahead you just go ahead it's easy i said okay it's your place
 	
 	
 		well how long did it take y'all
 	
 	
 		well a couple of weekends we would go down two or three hours on the weekends and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so there was two of y'all
 	
 	
 		no there was they were doing all sorts of repairs and there was i was just painting because i don't know how to do anything else so there's a whole bunch of people yeah
 	
 	
 		well that's easy enough
 		um
 	
 	
 		so now i feel like if i ever buy a house i can probably paint if nothing else
 	
 	
 		i think i could probably do it uh as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but you know i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys and the guy said oh get this it's a nice shiny gloss which was true
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but i didn't realize what you know a pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you don't have latex i don't know if it's worth the shine
 	
 	
 		um-hum
