 
     		
 	
 		well how do you feel about spot testing spot testing for drugs
 	
 	
 		well
 		basically i think it would be a good idea myself
 		i uh
 		i think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it uh i do think that there has to be some controls uh like i don't think one test positive should
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh be uh
 		the end of it you know i i think they should test more than once
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah it's it's refreshing to hear somebody that has a similar opinion as mine i mean all these people that are against it that may they yeah they may not even be on drugs yet they they call it an invasion of privacy
 	
 	
 		it
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i don't see you know that to me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		and they i believe that they have the right to know if you're using a a dangerous substance
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum there's so many jobs that uh really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life and you know and it's uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and i just um
 		i i think there definitely needs to be some control to it i guess it is possible to have a false
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		positive report
 	
 	
 		yeah no i i i agree that you know you there there needs to be a a well thought out sane approach to how to administer that program just because you know you you something can get mixed in the mail or
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		uh the chemicals could react incorrectly than than what you would expect them to and yeah you
 	
 	
 		or somebody's test get mixed up with somebody else's i mean those things do happen
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh i certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined uh wrongly
 	
 	
 		right and you know i've the the the company that i work for uh has just recently well you know within the last couple of years instituted for all new hired employees they submit to a uh urine test
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and
 		they they say that there've been you know they they they've also implemented random testing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and  it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that you know it's been in progress but uh i i fully agree with it and there's you know there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		i i agree with you if if if you feel it's an invasion of privacy you've you've probably got something you're trying to hide
 	
 	
 		yeah and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that uh doesn't require the testing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh
 		to me
 		it's to me it's not an invasion of privacy i think it's people have a right to know if if uh their their life maybe is in jeopardy or uh
 	
 	
 		or the quality of their products
 	
 	
 		yeah their work the work they're doing for their company
 		uh those things are all affected if not immediately it certainly does eventually
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i think that's where a lot of the problem is at first it doesn't seem to
 		uh bother the quality of work
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but eventually it does
 	
 	
 		right because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		course i feel the same way on the AIDS problem
 		i i don't think that's an invasion of privacy that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know and it's destroying a lot of people's lives
 	
 	
 		and then and one of the few that they don't have a cure for
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's you know it's it's destroying people's lives and i i think
 		that person plus anybody in danger should should be know about it and be aware of it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i don't know it's it's kind of hard to
 		i guess the the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that that uh an invasion of privacy of course that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today i guess so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i kind of get off on a tangent here uh do you work for uh Texas Instruments uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yes i do
 		and i'm i'm down in the the central but i don't know how familiar you are with Texas but i'm in a we live in a town uh near a town called Temple which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh that's probably way my brother did live in Grapevine Texas that's near Dallas
 	
 	
 		right we're yeah we're probably about two two and a half hours south of him
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		it's pretty hot down there probably
 	
 	
 		oh my it's actually we got about two inches of rain in about three hours yesterday and it's cooled things down somewhat it's getting more humid now but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh did you really oh that's great
 		uh-huh we we need rain real bad up here it's uh everything's really getting dry it's uh
 	
 	
 		um
 		it's been about three weeks since we had any
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of at a dangerous level here people hauling water and uh it's getting real bad
 	
 	
 		
 
 		hum
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so so
 	
 	
 		how about that
 		well i hope you do get some rain up there
 	
 	
 		um
 		so do i
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh i can't think of anything else uh
 	
 	
 		but
 		yeah i i i guess being in agreement kind of tends to limit the conversation you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh i can understand i know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them
 		i can see them objecting
 		you know there's a lot of people that think there's nothing wrong with
 	
 	
 		one of the things i found interesting it it's funny that you mentioned that TI is pretty much a worldwide company and we have manufacturing plants all around the world
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal
 	
 	
 		um um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and the policy doesn't apply to those folks
 	
 	
 		um is that right
 	
 	
 		yeah they don't have to submit to drug testing like like they do here in the States and some places abroad
 	
 	
 		oh i'll be darn
 	
 	
 		yeah i thought that was kind of interesting too
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah the different cultures and that too uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i mean uh uh from from a quality standpoint that's not i mean just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way
 	
 	
 		no no i'm sure it would have to affect you the same way
 		i i can't think that would make any differen ce whether it was legal or not it it would have to affect you the same way
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		yeah but like if you're going to do business in another country you've got to respect their rules i mean if if you know that's that's the trade off i guess
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh yeah you can't you go by their laws
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there that's why a lot get in trouble
 	
 	
 		hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because they have to follow their rules and uh some of the countries are very much against drugs and
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		you use them you pay for it
 	
 	
 		usually with your life in some places you know
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah a lot of them yeah where where is it they lose a
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger is that where it is i thought wow  you know that's quite a deterrent
 	
 	
 		yeah from the Middle East
 		yeah Iraq Iran in that area yeah
 		well in in Saudi Arabia you know using uh alcohol and drugs and stuff like that you get the death penalty
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's pretty strict over there
 	
 	
 		yeah so i guess you know we really we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how great our country is
 	
 	
 		well people tend to take the first amendment out of context which which means you know i could do anything i want to and you can't stop me and you know
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 		they they abuse it is what they do yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		so that's
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		i don't know i'm i'm i'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy
 	
 	
 		
  
 		um
