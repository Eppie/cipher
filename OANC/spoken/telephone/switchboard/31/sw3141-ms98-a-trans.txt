 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well what kind of pet do you have
 	
 	
 		one very old fat cat  Prissy and that's why Pat won't ever let me have a party at my house
 	
 	
 		that's right i remembered
 		that's right
 		Prissy get's you in trouble because you can't have them there
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		she does shed a lot of fur
 	
 	
 		and how many pets have you had
 	
 	
 		she's we've had her for a long time we used to have a Spitz that kind of got deposited on us when a cousin was getting a divorce and we were supposed to keep her temporarily for about twelve years
 		usually we've had dogs or cats
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well you know we have a dog named Pumpkin so what we've had him
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		a year and a half
 		and uh it's okay i don't know i i i told my kids basically i would just not as i just soon not have a pet in the house but i give in
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm reaching that point too
 	
 	
 		yeah it's it's it's hard for me i like pets a lot but i just don't like them in the house
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i wished you know i wish we lived in an area where we had a big backyard i'd have a dog  you know i'd have it outside but um i
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well i'm thinking of a next time about going back to a dog though because the cats really do shed a lot you just never get rid of the cat hair
 	
 	
 		do they
 	
 	
 		and i know there are a lot of dogs that are pretty clean and don't shed so Emily wants a dog a lot of her friends have little house mops kind of like yours
 	
 	
 		sure
 		sure
 		well it is easy and like Pumpkin is real easy i mean we don't even have to walk him much or anything he
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		but do you have to let him outside for all his business and all yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah he goes out in the morning
 	
 	
 		but see that's what would be hard for us since we're not there a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well unless you got a doggy door you know like my my aunt and uncle have a doggy door and their dog just goes in and out at will
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so that that's nice
 	
 	
 		i think Jay would go bananas over that though he he likes for our house to be as secure as possible
 	
 	
 		all sealed up
 		yeah i know that's that's the problem with it but um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but basically dogs our dogs worked out has worked out well and i think it's nice for the children i it's not my most favorite thing in the world but
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that can be so therapeutic though when when i really want to just crawl into a shell i think uh wouldn't it be nice just to lay on the bed and pet the cat
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right well they are loving i mean that's
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's the thing uh you know my friend Barb i have a friend good friend who's just moved here and she's gotten two cats and honestly she is just crazy about those cats
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and she's single lives by herself and they totally have kept her company you know i mean it is just it's really meant a lot to her to have those cats
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		and i really i i don't think i'm prejudiced since i've had both but i think cats are more prone to really have personalities i mean they own you rather than the other way around
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i really do believe that i get a kick out of seeing my seventy seven year old aunt with her animals and she had a cat get killed
 		not too long ago and she said no more you know i just i can't go through that again and it wasn't three months before she had another one and just adapting to it just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		like she always had
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and it's really neat for people living alone like you say with your friend
 	
 	
 		yeah it's really you know Barb said she wishes that she had done it years ago you know that she had um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		gotten an animal years ago because she's been single a long time and you know she says it just makes a world of difference to come home and have them in the house
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		growing up it was so funny because mother would always have a soft heart for strays and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we never back then you didn't spay and neuter your animals that much you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never get rid of them fast enough before the next litter came along it wasn't usual unusual for us to have six and seven cats and
 		i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them that were going to be award winning type  photos they've always been a part of my life
 	
 	
 		well i guess so you've had them so you had them just from early on then
 	
 	
 		oh yeah we had a Cocker Spaniel growing up but but the cats were the things that i loved and especially with being around kittens and the babies and all
 	
 	
 		now were they indoor cats or outdoor cats
 	
 	
 		no no dad never never would have allowed that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so they always just kind of showed up and came and went and had babies and  we played with them we we used them as dolls sometimes we'd dress them up and put them in carriages as much as they'd tolerate it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it was always fun
 	
 	
 		uh-huh well now see we lived on a real busy intersection in Phoenix and we had a dog but he was killed we we couldn't it was it was not it just wasn't conducive to animals
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		that was traumatic wasn't it yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah it was it was very traumatic my sister it was really upsetting to my little sister and and um so that it just we didn't have many pets growing up just because our house wasn't conducive to that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh it just wasn't safe we didn't have a fence and our dog just got killed we'd keep him chained up but he got out and you know sure enough was hit by a car so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah that's exactly what happened with ours and my brother really took it
 		hard because he was the one that had left the gate open so he blamed himself personally although you know there were so many things that could have been different but it was hard for him to cope with it being his fault
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah i bet
 	
 	
 		so i do hate that i that's one reason i like cats and critters that can stay inside because you don't face that
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it's it's hard
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		especially if you really do get attached to them i'm i'm already kind of preparing for Prissy dying because she's pretty old and fat and oh i just know it's going to come sooner or later so that's one reason i've been letting Emily talk about dogs because i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we we say that's going to be the end but i think when it really comes to it we'll want another pet
 	
 	
 		how old is Prissy
 	
 	
 		she's at least thirteen or fourteen we don't know exactly because we got her as a young kitten or a you ng cat and didn't know that much about her she's a neat cat i mean she owns us all the way
 	
 	
 		um
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		but
 		it does require a little bit of work and housecleaning
 	
 	
 		well uh you know it does that's just it and right now it's i do well to just take care of my children
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		you know without taking care of an animal too so
 	
 	
 		um-hum and you have the problem when you travel too we always we board her now and that gets kind of expensive
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		that's right we just we just were on vacation and uh it was you know it was expensive plus i think you know for Pumpkin he didn't you know he didn't like it we were gone two weeks and that was hard on him to be boarded for two weeks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		where'd y'all go
 	
 	
 		uh we can't talk about that can we  we went to Gulf  Gulf
 	
 	
 		no i guess not  it's not pet related
 	
 	
 		Gulf Shores Alabama and New Orleans and so we had a really good time
 	
 	
 		oh boy yeah
 		oh how neat
 	
 	
 		so but yeah Pumpkin was
 	
 	
 		but the puppy survived
 	
 	
 		yes he did i always wonder i think well now how much do they remember you know like
 	
 	
 		and you know my aunt says that they do drug them i just went bananas when she told me that that was a fact that she had shopped kennels
 		and vets and that they all very lightly sedate them so that they sleep a lot and that just gave me the creeps because i you know i hate to think they did that to anything or anybody
 	
 	
 		oh
 		huh
 	
 	
 		but she said every vet's office and kennel if they would let it if they
