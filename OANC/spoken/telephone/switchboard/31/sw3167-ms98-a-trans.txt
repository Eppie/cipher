 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		they suggested some sort of a recipe uh for um company for entertaining did you have anything in mind that uh you'd like to share
 	
 	
 		well i uh just had a Christmas Around the World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres and
 	
 	
 		ooh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i fixed uh a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy it's uh
 	
 	
 		ooh that sounds good what
 	
 	
 		it's like uh eight ounces of cream cheese softened and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice one tablespoon Worcester sauce
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and mix it and spread it out onto a plate and
 	
 	
 		i see
 		one tablespoon of Worcester
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and then you take and uh cover that with drained crab meat
 		mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuit crackers
 	
 	
 		oh that
 	
 	
 		and that always goes over real well and it's real easy
 	
 	
 		how much chili sauce did you say
 	
 	
 		it's one of the small bottles
 	
 	
 		like eight not eight ounces that would be a lot
 	
 	
 		i don't think uh it
 		well it's about eight ounces it it uh-huh
 	
 	
 		is it okay this would make a lot right
 	
 	
 		yeah it would probably make well it it doesn't make quite as much as you think but yeah spread out because you you keep the cream cheese kind of thin
 	
 	
 		and how much crab meat did you use
 	
 	
 		one tin of the flake uh-huh and drain it real good
 	
 	
 		one
 		one can of flake oh okay have you ever used the uh imitation yet
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes i have i used it uh last Christmas time uh what did i put it in
 		i think i just served it by itself there's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff
 	
 	
 		ooh that sounds i've tried it and then i have it here on hand for about a week and all of a sudden it dawned on me wait is this totally imitation and then i found out i went back to the store and they said it is a fish product
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so therefore you really don't have a very long life you know once you buy it i thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is you know
 	
 	
 		right right
 		that's very true very true i had bought a cheesecake uh and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be refrozen which i felt was real nice
 	
 	
 		oh that's a good idea whose was that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		it uh was uh Lawry's i believe or Lawler's and i got it do you have a Sam's wholesale warehouse up there it's real
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh Sam's right right
 	
 	
 		yeah okay that's where i picked it up and it comes out of Chicago and they're very good cheesecakes
 	
 	
 		oh oh that sounds good because that's great that must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes yes and they have and they have the little papers between them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay i i've
 		right oh hey that sound
 	
 	
 		and i think they're what about nine dollars and something
 	
 	
 		right and it's something good to have on hand too it's frozen in the first place right so you can uh it is frozen isn't it
 	
 	
 		yes yes yes
 		yes it is frozen and i thaw it and then you can refreeze it and uh-huh it was they're very good very good and that's the one thing that i hate to make is desserts
 	
 	
 		and then you can refreeze
 		hey that sounds great that sounds
 		oh do you and that's my favorite and i really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it
 	
 	
 		is it
 		oh i love to eat it but i don't like to make it it takes time and you have to rack your brain and time i don't have anymore
 	
 	
 		
 
 		that's the that's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i'm going to serve i i said i can make it in no time it's trying to think
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh-huh it is
 	
 	
 		and then we just uh built a new home and i have one of these kitchens that the center of the house and so no matter where they're at your company can see you cooking which is funny
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right and your mess
 	
 	
 		well this is what everyone has said they said it's okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen and i said yes i decided it looks better in Better Homes and Gardens than it does in practicality
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh what i have learned in the uh ten months we've lived here is that when i entertain i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven
 		with all the everything through ready to serve because with the open area you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said so you have to have the picturesque kitchen you know right out of the magazine
 	
 	
 		yeah right right
 		that's that's right
 		well i like to have mine all done anyway because then i want to i want to party too i don't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something you know
 	
 	
 		you're right and you know the funny thing is now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that i still have people trying to come in you know they'll come in the kitchen and i said
 		out we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for for guests you're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen
 	
 	
 		
 
 		correct
 		sounds
 	
 	
 		and it it it has worked out but at our point of life we know many  of the people we're entertaining  uh well enough that they know you know it's very much at home type situation
 	
 	
 		right
 		well a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples again that we've known a long time like you they uh we all bring things and it sure makes it a whole lot easier anymore
 	
 	
 		oh we even have a better one now we decided that we all meet we have it worked worked
