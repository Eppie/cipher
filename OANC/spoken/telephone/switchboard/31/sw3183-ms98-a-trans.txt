 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well we're gonna be talking about vacations i guess huh  where have you been recently
 	
 	
 		right right
 		i have been well i go quite a bit i travel about forty percent of my time but my vacations  my favorite spot is Las Vegas yeah
 	
 	
 		Las Vegas well my dad goes there but i am not a betting man i've been there one time and i'll be honest i did not enjoy it no no
 	
 	
 		really i are there any particular reason you're not into gambling or
 	
 	
 		i i guess just because i'm not that type of a person i'm i'm a CPA and i i'm very conservative with my money and i just did to me that was not a vacation
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		uh i now i'm a big world traveler i enjoy traveling the world i just got back from Hawaii uh this past July uh the prior year before that i'd been to uh Tokyo Disneyland
 		uh i've been i've got a trip coming up next year i'm going to the EuroDisney
 	
 	
 		oh really in France
 	
 	
 		uh that's gonna be in Paris France we're going there in July
 	
 	
 		yes
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and at the same time we're also gonna go visit Norway i've always wanted to go see the Fjords of Norway i just love have have have you ever been on a cruise to um Alaska
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no uh my in-laws have and i i stay stay steer away from boats as much as possible only because i can't take it
 	
 	
 		okay
 		well i tell you what if i possibly can uh there's a spot that i would love to encourage you to go visit
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		my father same way
 		he had absolutely no desire to be around a boat he says man i get seasick i don't like it
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		the thing that is so wonderful about the Alaskan cruise it is on what they call the inside passage
 	
 	
 		right right exactly
 	
 	
 		you're not in the ocean you are in a river almost
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		only only the only thing you have are cliffs on the left and cliffs on the right side and we're talking about five hundred foot thousand foot cliffs
 		absolutely gorgeous and
 	
 	
 		i yes everything i see that they brought back it i i definitely agree
 	
 	
 		and and and and every yeah and every thirty yards here comes another uh waterfall which is nothing more than the melting snow
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		that's just more glorious than the last one it is absolutely fantastic and with those cliffs the sunsets are just oh my goodness uh
 		for me and my wife it was probably the most romantic one week trip i have ever ever taken
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and the food  the food on we were on uh Princess Cruise Lines and the food was just out of this world
 	
 	
 		oh yes yes
 		i it's it cruises from what i understand are are really the way to go and someday someday i will convince my or convince myself that i can handle it and i will surprise my wife and and book a cruise  uh i
 		much definitely prefer warmer climates than Alaska so i would probably head for the Caribbean
 	
 	
 		well if that be the case
 		i was gonna say you can go to the Caribbean but the now the problem with the Caribbean though now you've got the ocean and i've been to the Caribbean three times now you got the ocean and if you have a motion sickness problem now they have these little patches you can put behind your ear
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		i've used those right
 	
 	
 		uh you'd wanna use those but the same time though you you're not going to get as pleasant of a ride as you would on that Alaskan cruise
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		interesting interesting i never i really never thought of that that's pretty good to know
 	
 	
 		uh but and and and there there are parts especially when you get close to Cuba there are the water can get very very rough
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		really can  but uh otherwise as far as vacation i've i've course i see i guess i like the cold weather i i've been up to New England and i thought that was fantastic
 	
 	
 		yeah and this is one spot you know being in Ohio the New England states are not that far uh that is one thing that really has not interested us we do like the Virginias the Carolinas Carolina
 	
 	
 		um
 		now
 		oh have you have you been on the Blue Ridge Parkway oh wow now that's fantastic
 	
 	
 		oh yes several times
 		yeah and uh we next week we're leaving for New Orleans  and i'm i i do prefer the warmer the warmer
 	
 	
 		see i'm a Louisiana boy so i know where you're talking about there
 	
 	
 		um-hum  but uh and i loved Hawaii
 	
 	
 		yes now that was my first trip i've ever been to Hawaii yes
 	
 	
 		uh we had bought
 		really it it's it's uh it's just beautiful i just
 		i would be very happy staying in Hawaii and becoming a beachcomber when i retire which isn't too far off which is something i might wanna consider but uh
 	
 	
 		well stay away from the Texas coastlines Texas doesn't have anything for you
 	
 	
 		i you know i've i've been tempted i've gotten down as far as San Antonio but i've never gone down to uh really to the coastline
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the the coastline yeah the coastline here is the pits uh there's there's much better in Florida much much better uh other places Hawaii was wonderful that was great
 	
 	
 		yeah so
 		uh-huh
 		i love it yes i  that
 	
 	
 		uh i thought Waikiki Beach was as nice of a of a beach as i ever wanna see and we went to four different islands we had a great time
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yes it is and you have to do that uh people that go and they only go to one area you have to see it all
 	
 	
 		well tell you what i've got a i've got a phone ringing on the other line i better go answer it i've enjoyed talking to you though catch you later bye-bye
