 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay do you have you ever had to put your children in in child care Mary Dell
 	
 	
 		oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my daughter that's seventeen now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i worked even when she was a baby
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to have put them in a Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		right off of Walnut Hill and Preston and it was a wonderful environment i i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh i see
 	
 	
 		so it worked well how about you
 	
 	
 		oh well i have uh a nine year old and a six year old and neither one of them has ever been in in uh day care for the reason of of me working but uh they both went through preschool
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh  we've just been real lucky  i think anyway to not
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it's not hard to find anything that's part-time so many of the churches have really strong
 	
 	
 		right like half day programs uh-huh
 	
 	
 		preschool and children's day out but it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown Dallas
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they were so  seemed cold and impersonal i just couldn't hack it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and what i liked about Preston Hollow is that
 		the people that were there when Cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		so it it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and i'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that
 	
 	
 		right right yeah
 	
 	
 		that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah that is um a big drawback i think in that in the uh public schools out here
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know to your lucky to have an art teacher and if you do  you get them once a week or something you know
 	
 	
 		or pay for it after school our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art and
 	
 	
 		oh is that right i had no idea
 	
 	
 		you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah
 	
 	
 		and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not going to
 	
 	
 		well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes
 	
 	
 		not going to change anytime soon
 		oh my goodness
 		yeah that's true well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten
 		you know it's like wham  culture shock it's just
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah put the colors away  which is too bad
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah get the computers out and you know well that's hard it's so difficult for them um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		did you have your children did you say in home in in private care was that in your home or in someone else's home
 	
 	
 		until they were two yeah yeah both times they were at our house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh so you were able to have somebody come there
 	
 	
 		and that was hard too i i lucked out with really good people both times but i know so many people that are never able to find that and i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it so  yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah did you have a nanny or did you have someone that lived in with you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well no she didn't live with us uh the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		and she kept Cheryl during the day and then did  more babysitting at night and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that that was a plus from that respect as well and then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so
 	
 	
 		oh gosh
 		uh-huh uh-huh i have uh a
 	
 	
 		i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center
 	
 	
 		uh-huh i was just listening to a program this morning oh well i guess it was on the Home Show but they were talking about uh
 		a new uh  oh i can't even think of the name of it i was halfway listening while i was painting um it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and they've now moved it to Washington DC and the the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know i can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there
 	
 	
 		yeah oh that would be hard
 	
 	
 		you know so um
 	
 	
 		well they give a lot more leave i work at NCNB now and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for elderly people or
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh boy that's great
 	
 	
 		for up to six months it's really neat i've i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you don't have to just wean wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals i've of course it's too late for me so i've i've not tried them to see how effective they are but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast
 	
 	
 		gosh it's amazing
 	
 	
 		and for our age group it's too late too little too late
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		but i  i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work two income families i think are here to stay
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		well and i would think you know since big business is supposedly
 		why the government makes the decisions they do
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know the the people that work in big business have families they have children so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and uh
 	
 	
 		right yeah
 		oh sure
 		you retain employees and keep them longer that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		well they want us to be happy and wa nt us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so i i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time because that's hard
 	
 	
 		oh that's good
 		that's good to know i got a couple of friends that have have found the uh
 		you know a private a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age and they
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		usually you know you'll find a a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home and my future future sister-in-law's mother does that too full-time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well in Plano though the problem is you find and this is what i found with Emily i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in Plano area
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i kept finding neighbors and friends and they'd move she ended up being in a different home every year
 	
 	
 		oh too transit uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move so this year i i tried KinderCare and then she's old enough to
 	
 	
 		and her surroundings too yeah
