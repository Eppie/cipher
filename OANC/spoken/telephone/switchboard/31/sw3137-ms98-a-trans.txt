 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well uh Cathy do you have any pets in your home
 	
 	
 		we do actually we have a a Golden Retriever a dog and we have a cat and we have we just got two um
 	
 	
 		how nice um-hum
 	
 	
 		Russian Dwarf hamsters  which  dwarf hamsters lucky us huh
 	
 	
 		dwarf hamsters
 		how big is a dwarf hamster
 	
 	
 		real small they're maybe about oh two inches long they're real small they're real tiny they're cute they really are cute
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 		my goodness where did you get those
 	
 	
 		uh my son's baseball coach uh had two and then had multiple  hamsters that he was trying to get rid of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so that's that's where we got them from now we've been assured they're both males and they're in two separate cages so we don't want any
 	
 	
 		well
 		okay
 		i was going to say that
 	
 	
 		we don't want to go into the dwarf hamster business
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		well right now we don't have any pets we've uh we've tried various things we you know obviously do have children
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh we tried a dog first and we had a a puppy a uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		a what did they call him a Westie
 	
 	
 		uh-huh is uh is are they very small uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they're small uh-huh it's a terrier and uh that didn't work out very well
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh for a variety of reasons but the
 		the dog was just all mouth and teeth it seemed like the only way it could of show affection was by nibbling you on things
 	
 	
 		oh really yeah
 		oh no kidding uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah so it it never worked out and uh
 		so we we have we gave up on that and then we tried cats
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and we ended up with a
 		a bad set of cats if that's possible but i'm a i'm a big fan of cats i always had cats growing up
 	
 	
 		oh
 		um-hum
 		are you yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh my wife on the other hand was not a fan of cats at all but we had these two that they we knew someone that uh uh you know wanted to get rid of these kittens and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh so we gave it a try
 		and uh they were impossible to house train
 	
 	
 		really boy that's real unusual for cats usually you just put down a litter box and that's the end of that yeah
 	
 	
 		that's the end of that and these it was real strange and uh they were both solid white cats
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh one had blue eyes and the other had white regular you know yellow eyed cats
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		brothers and sisters and we had them declawed and we had them neutered and uh invested all all that money in it into it but uh we simply one of them in particular we just could not uh
 		train to use we tried different types of litter changed it frequently and it was just unbelievable
 	
 	
 		really really huh huh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so we finally found someone else that was willing to to to give it a try with them
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and sure enough it it worked worked worked for a little while and then they too couldn't seem to get them to use the litter box
 	
 	
 		really really hum
 	
 	
 		uh so they ended up finding someone else that was willing to give it a try and that's when i lost track of these two cats
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really yeah yeah oh that's too bad
 	
 	
 		yeah that was that was pretty sad because uh it took a lot of lobbying just to get the cats in the house to begin with so we sure couldn't make another try at it
 	
 	
 		sure sure sure
 		yeah yeah well we were real fortunate with our pets um when my husband and i were getting married we we had both been married before and so we were blending families and we had taken this blended families course through uh
 		P I S T you know they how they have the effective parent parent training effectiveness effectiveness training
 	
 	
 		hum
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh so we took a blended families course and Linda Hitt the person who was teaching the course said sometimes when you have children on this side and children on this side
 		you have a you know a mutual child that brings the family together and we looked at each other and laughed and said we'll get a dog  and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet that's funny
 	
 	
 		and uh so we i had always wanted a Golden Retriever i just think they're real neat dogs that that's a nice breed you know they're real calm and gentle and
 		and whatnot so my husband thought well for Christmas he was going to surprise me with a puppy and he was looking around for a puppy and
 		then um he saw he decided just on a whim i think i'll call the SPCA
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and he called the Dallas SPCA and he said you wouldn't happen to have a Golden Retriever would you and they said you won't believe it but we had one dropped off last night
 	
 	
 		good grief
 	
 	
 		and he'd they said he's AKC registered he's two years old and he's going to go fast
 	
 	
 		i'll bet yeah
 	
 	
 		so we thought okay what's wrong with this dog who would give up a two year old Golden Retriever you know that's a nice dog something's got to be wrong with this dog
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		nothing is wrong with it we have had him now for three years and just love him to death he is wonderful yeah he is he's a great dog he's he's
 	
 	
 		well that's great
 	
 	
 		he makes a real lousy uh watchdog though because he he just loves everybody and he wags his tail and you know
 		he's he's great he's great we just we think he's wonderful
 		and our cat just kind of you know pays us the time of day when he's in the mood and otherwise
 		we don't see him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		is it primarily outdoor cat then or just
 	
 	
 		yeah he is he comes in and he goes out he's he kind of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		you know is just around we we don't really don't see him except for feeding time you know or when he wants when he's in the mood for a little affection
 	
 	
 		that's interesting
 		he'll show up huh
 	
 	
 		he'll show up yeah yeah
 		but so that's our family and we just you know uh everybody seems to get along real well the kids the dog and the cat so we're okay
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		great
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well has the cat discovered the uh the hamsters yet
 	
 	
 		the hamsters actually it's the dog that is enthralled with the hamsters because the hamsters are recent you know they were just last week
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and
 		the first night we had them
 		somebody knocked over the cage and we thought it was the cat we really did we blamed the cat and we thought the hamster had disappeared and had been eaten but we found him he he just he narrowly escaped with his life but he was found
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but since then we have discovered the dog sits and watches them for hours on end
 	
 	
 		oh my goodness
 	
 	
 		you know they'll get going in the little wheel and he'll sit there and just stare at them so i'm wondering now if it really was the cat who knocked them off the shelf it might have been it might have been the dog
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but the cat doesn't seem to be too bothered with them it's it's the dog that just sits there for hour after hour and watches these hamsters it's it's funny
 	
 	
 		i'll be and my sister has tried that with both hamsters gerbils and small birds
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's amazing what their cat has been able to do
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		i think that pretty much over time has figured out a way to get those small creatures
 	
 	
 		out really
 	
 	
 		eventually to get them out to get the cage down from wherever it is even if it's the top of the refrigerator
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to get that cage down and into it somehow
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well we warned them you the kids you know we said you know with the cat in the house you know these may not last too long
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		is that right
 	
 	
 		but he doesn't seem to be bothered with them you know he's real content you know chasing flies and birds outside so you know he's he's not too bad
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but so are you going to try again with another cat sometime
 	
 	
 		well i would like to we shall see i want it to be a you know indoor outdoor animal next time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
