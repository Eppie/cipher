 
     		
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		well course my favorite team there is the Texas Rangers so  i watch them all the time
 		and who do you watch
 	
 	
 		uh the Mets but i don't do that anymore  because uh they're doing lousy  i don't know
 	
 	
 		the Mets
 		this isn't their best season is it
 	
 	
 		no no
 	
 	
 		well the Rangers are the few games behind Minnesota but if we could win the next oh i guess we'd win have to win most all of them we could still go to the to the race to do the
 	
 	
 		i think you're uh  definitely an avid fan huh
 	
 	
 		well i watched the two games the last two nights so
 	
 	
 		they just i gave up on the Mets around August you know
 	
 	
 		oh is that right
 	
 	
 		how many games out is Texas
 	
 	
 		pardon
 	
 	
 		how many games out are they
 	
 	
 		i think they're out six
 		and so they have to still win almost every single game that they have to play to the end now
 	
 	
 		right right yeah i think Minnesota's got to get like three wins or or Texas has to lose three games or some combination of that  well maybe next year
 	
 	
 		or else
 		yeah yeah
 		i don't know Minnesota's won a good game they're they're doing a good job this year i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah they they are they are
 	
 	
 		they really but i'm gonna watch tonight because Nolan Ryan's gonna pitch so i always like to watch him pitch
 	
 	
 		yeah who's who's who he used to be on the Mets a long time ago but who's who's who else is like Texas's big players that that uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum
 		well uh we just traded Buechele and i really liked him but but he's gone now  so i i guess uh Sierra i like to watch him bat
 	
 	
 		right Ruben right he's supposed to be good
 	
 	
 		yeah he's he's really good Franco's good except that uh he's got injuries right now his hamstring's down in the bottom of his legs he can't run very well but
 		it he usually hits a home run then he just trots around the bases it's okay  and um
 	
 	
 		he's the shortstop though right Franco
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah well they've moved him now since he can't move that quickly since it hurts him
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		they moved him to second base and they moved Petralli into that area in that runs now in between the shortstop area and he takes second base
 	
 	
 		and Sierra's an outfielder
 	
 	
 		um Sierra let's see yeah Sierra's into
 		is he middle field or left field he's not left field he must be center field
 	
 	
 		yeah i don't see i don't know the American League that well once in a while i watch the Yankees um but rarely and uh but this guy that i'm i work with is in this rotisserie league where they they choose
 	
 	
 		do you
 		oh now what's that i don't know what that is
 	
 	
 		well you choose players and you do stuff based on stats and everything like that so he's always talking to me about the American League
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		like he gets points for every time uh i think he has Ruben Sierra on his team and every time he hits a home run or steals a base or gets a hit he gets a certain amount of points and then you get pitchers and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so he's always talking about the American League which is like i said because i watch the Mets i don't really know that much about the American League
 	
 	
 		yeah that's hard
 	
 	
 		you're not an Astro fan
 	
 	
 		um no not too  not too much  i i guess i just don't watch them that much um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i like to watch the Oakland A's play they have a lot of good players too but i haven't watched them for a while so i don't know how they're doing too well this season
 	
 	
 		no they're not they they were doing well for a while but then they kind of fell off do you get all the games out there i mean you get you get to watch the A's a lot and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um once every so often mostly Rangers games come on because that's our area but um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		every once in a while on a Saturday or a Sunday they'll put a another league on you know
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it's it just depends
 		how to you know how they fill the time sometimes
 		anyway i um we got
 	
 	
 		this is my first conversation through this Texas Instruments thing
 	
 	
 		what
 	
 	
 		this is the first time i've done one of these conversations yeah
 	
 	
 		oh is it
 		oh well that's kind of fun
 	
 	
 		so i didn't even expect it i just i happened to have the uh i didn't even know what my um  my personal identification number was i just happened to have the folder right in front of me i'm glad i brought it into work just
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah uh isn't it's a fun thing i think you'll like it it's a it's a old thing to do and um
 		anyway we just uh if you get run out of things to say then you say good bye  it was nice talking to you too
 	
 	
 		okay well it's nice talking to you and uh be good thank you
 	
 	
 		and have a good day um bye-bye
