 
     		
 	
 		how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home
 	
 	
 		so it
 		well i don't feel very good about it but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we
 		sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore he actually died a few months after that and so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do because he
 		it was either you know a nursing
 		home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days
 	
 	
 		right
 		and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him
 	
 	
 		um well the
 		see uh well we
 		he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list
 	
 	
 		oh my
 	
 	
 		right we wound up just choosing a another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into
 		or we no actually no it was even Mennonite related i'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home mostly
 		the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in
 	
 	
 		yeah so the convenience
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh what do you think
 	
 	
 		my grandmother lived with us um until August um and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home she has leukemia
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton and were several thousand miles away
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home and my sister being on the other end found one
 		that she could have what was called an independent living facility she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and TV set so
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's important i'd say
 	
 	
 		yes and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		so she didn't have to be transported back and forth so she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well it's not her favorite place to be in she'd much rather be here with me but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her and i've got little children here who needed me here
 	
 	
 		right so that
 	
 	
 		um she needed somebody to watch her twenty four hours a day
 	
 	
 		right and that becomes difficult then
 	
 	
 		so
 		she was falling down and hemorrhaging and you know all kinds of physical problems so it just became too much for me to handle even though i would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore
 	
 	
 		um-hum yep we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several  points during the last few years of his life
 		but he was essentially too proud and too
 		independent so that even though his heart was
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		lived in
 		his own house as long as he could though he was living alone
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the uh top without a great deal of pain
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and this eventually
 		things just went too far and he
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions it sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now
 	
 	
 		right well that's
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to
 		help decide what's the right thing
 	
 	
 		well we enjoyed having her here but we feel she's much safer where she is now she still continues to fall but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her
 	
 	
 		and
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i know she's eating the right things and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her so
 		it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		so i think she'll adjust
