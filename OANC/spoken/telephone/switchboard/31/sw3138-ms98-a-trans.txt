 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		okay i guess we're going to discuss food and cooking
 	
 	
 		alright
 	
 	
 		do you enjoy cooking
 	
 	
 		sometimes not all the time
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i'm kind of that way too when i have i i enjoy cooking when i have time
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		i don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's about the same boat i'm in too
 	
 	
 		it gets kind of boring
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		how big is the family you cook for
 	
 	
 		uh five
 	
 	
 		uh-huh we have four so
 		and two of them are teenage boys so
 	
 	
 		oh yeah well i'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too so
 	
 	
 		are they
 	
 	
 		and they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah we have that problem too but also now it's just the amount that they eat it's just absolutely incredible
 	
 	
 		uh
 		oh yeah well see i my my oldest is nine and he already he already does that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		does he  well
 	
 	
 		and i told him he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat
 	
 	
 		yeah  that's true uh
 		do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		favorite recipes that you've come across or
 	
 	
 		my husband and i our favorite meal is um and we do it like for special stuff celebrations and we have like steak and he does the steak and then uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		out on the grill uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and he marinates it in his special stuff that he does and it's real good and uh i do sauteed mushrooms so and asparagus and that's our favorite
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		ooh yeah
 		ooh that's sound good i love that
 	
 	
 		dinner
 	
 	
 		my husband really likes seafood
 	
 	
 		yeah so do we
 	
 	
 		um and uh i think that no matter what i do i don't serve enough of it really to uh to suit him i didn't grow up eating that much seafood
 		and um so i don't know it's just kind of not natural to me but i like it and uh i don't know one of his favorite things is uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		well it's called seafood stew and it's really it's really like a soup soup that that you serve over rice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it and
 	
 	
 		it's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it is it
 	
 	
 		no no that's kind of Louisiana i think if you do that yeah  i don't either
 	
 	
 		i don't know what that i don't see how you eat that but
 	
 	
 		but uh no this is just really it is really good and and one thing that's good is it makes the a large amount and so i freeze usually we eat one and i freeze two containers of it then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but neither of my kids will eat it you know so then they eat a pizza or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so it
 		yeah it defeats the purpose
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah it really does one thing i've run across
 		recently though a friend gave me a recipe that i really like for chicken enchiladas have you made them
 	
 	
 		oh yeah yeah my husband makes those i'm not i don't eat enchiladas i i don't like enchiladas i don't like the texture i don't know i guess it's the texture or something i don't like the taste of enchiladas but everyone else in my family does
 	
 	
 		does he ooh
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		well are these are done with a flour tortilla is that what he uses yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i don't know i it's i don't know what i don't know i i don't know what it is about the enchiladas i just and i'm the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother i'm the only one that doesn't eat it but my kids love it you know
 	
 	
 		isn't that something yeah
 		i was going to say my kids both eat it i guess that's one thing that i particularly like um but i think it's good for you know for for company too and i've made it a few times um and you can make a lot at one time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when i needed to make something to uh to give somebody you know like you know to take over to somebody's house or something else
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i've got a chicken casserole that's like that that that i've
 	
 	
 		it it's nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own family and then uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yeah because i when i make this chicken casserole i it it makes a real big casserole and then another one that i freeze
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so or i give it to my Mom and Dad if i know we're not going to eat
 	
 	
 		what what does it have in it
 	
 	
 		it's just you can use chicken or turkey because my Mom started making it like right after Thanksgiving and using the leftover turkey
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it's rice and i i i when i do recipes i just throw stuff in i don't i'm not real good about measuring because i just i do it to taste
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh sure sometimes those are the best ones
 	
 	
 		and
 		well yeah but it it's like it's just chicken it it's as much as you want you know torn up and and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and celery and that's it and some hard boiled eggs
 	
 	
 		yeah ooh that sounds good
 	
 	
 		and that's it you just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to you know heat it through and you sprinkle uh that those um toasted onion rings
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh yeah those are good aren't they uh-huh
 	
 	
 		on top of it for the crunchy and that's it you know and it it it goes and it's filling because of the rice
 	
 	
 		um
 		that sounds good
 		right
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		you cook the rice before you put it in yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		i bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good
 	
 	
 		yeah it gives it a an extra yeah little tang
 	
 	
 		i guess i would now use the the new mayonnaise free
 	
 	
 		yeah that cholesterol fat free
 	
 	
 		yeah that's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		new things like that because like i told my husband this summer i love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that and and you know basically it certainly a low low calorie you know good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i know
 	
 	
 		you know and now it's it's it's okay and you can even i used to just put a tiny bit in well now i'm just putting more and more in
 	
 	
 		i don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it
 	
 	
 		yeah and it's only it used to be like a hundred hundred calories per tablespoon and now it's like twelve oh i just think that's the best thing to have happened i'm just so excited about that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i know
 	
 	
 		anyway
 	
 	
 		yeah we did the low-cal stuff well with my kids i don't they get enough sugar and stuff anyway mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway and they don't need any added help
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yes
 		right
 	
 	
 		so when we're here at home
 		you know with sweets and stuff they they don't we don't really do that much i do a lot of fruits
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		instead of the cakes and the candies and you know stuff like that and and drink wise they have Kool-Aid milk or water normally now when they go to their grandmother's house
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		which is every weekend it's a it's a different
 		it's a different story all around
 	
 	
 		that's when they
 		as our family would say a pig out huh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh that's exactly what it is
 	
 	
 		that's good oh one of my boys that that's twelve um  is has high cholesterol
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		have you ever found out about your kids
 	
 	
 		no not yet
 	
 	
 		and my other one does not so oh year or so ago he found out and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down and did he was able to get it down
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		it's i think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol he's never eaten any eggs he's never had anything but skim milk and you know i've never bought butter  and things like that but um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 	
 	
 		oh he just left for the doctor again and it's it's kind of back up um so he needs to be careful again so we've really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat yeah and uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		the lower cholesterol foods and stuff
 	
 	
 		so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so all that kind of stuff does really help well i think we've probably talked long enough and
