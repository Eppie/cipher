 
     		
 	
 		
 
 		and hello there so i guess the question is do you have any pets what do you have
 	
 	
 		hi
 		yes we well we have a cat yes named Bounce actually it's Bounce the uh about third
 	
 	
 		a cat named
 		Bounce
 		Bounce the third okay
 	
 	
 		yeah uh that's because  when i was little i had a storybook about a cat named Bounce and
 	
 	
 		and the name stuck with you
 	
 	
 		and the cat was um gray and white in particular had to be gray and white so all the Bounces have been gray and white we also have a rabbit
 	
 	
 		okay
 		very good
 		a rabbit
 	
 	
 		named Coco Bunny
 	
 	
 		and i assume that now the rabbit doesn't get out right the rabbit's in in the cage okay
 	
 	
 		right the rabbit is in a cage outdoors only year round
 		and this rabbit has been with us for um  oh six seven eight eight years
 	
 	
 		one now do you just have one rabbit in other words it never multiplies  okay
 	
 	
 		one rabbit
 		No  that's for sure and uh that's actually all the pets we have at this time
 	
 	
 		well i've i've had uh i had three Cocker Spaniels uh up until about
 	
 	
 		how about you
 	
 	
 		um four or five i guess about four years ago and they they were all very old twelve thirteen and fourteen fifteen and they died and but i believe the a child must have a
 	
 	
 		um hum um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		pet to grow up with so on my uh kid's fourth birthday his birthday present was a Basset Hound
 	
 	
 		right
 		oh
 	
 	
 		which as he calls it a basket hound but that's okay yes but uh anyway so yes we have the Basset Hound who is now two years old and in fact it just had the lovely uh
 	
 	
 		oh yeah  cute
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		yesterday i got to take the dog to the veterinarian for his shots
 	
 	
 		oh boy
 	
 	
 		that's one of the uh to me one of the things i don't care about having a pet about
 	
 	
 		did
 		right yeah does he live indoors or outdoors outdoor yeah that's kind of
 	
 	
 		no he's an outdoor dog uh he's a very low maintenance dog uh we actually have a uh an automatic feeder and we have an automatic waterer so he always has plenty of water
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		um
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i don't have to worry about going out there and like for example i'm going on this two week vacation he'll be fine
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		ooh how nice
 	
 	
 		no one even has to look after him although we have a neighbor who's going to come over you know say hello just to keep him happy but uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		he's just in the fenced backyard and
 	
 	
 		he's in a very well fenced backyard that has openings so he can look out and see the kids and chase the kids and he likes that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well how nice
 		yeah that sounds like a good situation that's about how i would like to have a dog if i had a dog
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		see our cat is also um well outdoors and in the garage
 		at one time she was an indoor cat and then she started to do things in the house that i didn't appreciate
 	
 	
 		
 
 		claw
 		now has it been declawed
 	
 	
 		no no no no well
 	
 	
 		it has not oh you should
 		have you ever thought of having it
 	
 	
 		well no because she's outdoors
 	
 	
 		okay okay
 	
 	
 		so if she's outdoors i don't want her declawed
 	
 	
 		true true true
 	
 	
 		um but she um she was kind of a feisty feisty feisty little character when she was little and as she has gotten older because she's about seven years old
 	
 	
 		now my wife would very much like to have a cat because she she grew up with a cat then uh the cat lived indoors and the whole bit i just don't care for cats i don't know what it is about it but she i guess because
 	
 	
 		would she
 		yeah
 		yeah well they're so independent a lot of people don't i
 	
 	
 		yes they are
 		you can't say come here i mean it just doesn't you know
 	
 	
 		that's true  it could just stand there and stare at you in a strange way in fact my cat right now is just rubbing up against the the wood on the door here staring
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		with a look of don't you want
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		to feed me or to pick me up and love me  yes you sweet thing
 	
 	
 		hum
 		well we have a humongous uh our back what do you call it the uh living room has nothing but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		one big window after another so it's all windows and we can look out in the backyard and we're always seeing the dog and the dog you know he's
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		he he knows when we're in the room because when we're in the room and just come walking down the hall whatnot he'll come and and look at us you know we'll wave at him he'll come back to you you know yeah
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		so he is sociable even though he even though he's outdoors yeah
 	
 	
 		yes he is he's very most loving dog you've ever had i can't i can't really i cannot imagine not having a dog
 	
 	
 		yeah my boys and um my husband have been talking recently about having a dog but we don't have a a fenced in backyard
 		and we don't want a fenced in backyard we're on a corner and we look out at a creek and a park
 		and we just you know one reason we
 	
 	
 		well what you have to do is have an indoor dog
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess it would have to be and we
 	
 	
 		and they can be very nice too after after they've been trained
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true
 		yeah well that's right
 	
 	
 		and they do require a lot of training
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's for sure
 	
 	
 		now my dog he you know we've got him trained that we could bring him inside but once we bought the new house my wife said uh-huh no no he's not coming inside this house so
 	
 	
 		uh-hum um  well pets
 		pets really are hard on houses i mean there's just no doubt about that we've my husband was in really estate for a while and
 		you know he had more problems over pets um in both rental houses and houses that people owned and other people looked at it and didn't like the way it smelled and so so that's my main
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and they do get the carpet uh  soiled sometimes
 	
 	
 		objection
 		yeah i mean even even the best trained one you know is going to have problems from time to time and you just can't really get that that smell out and
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well i tell you what i've got some uh carpet uh cleaner that uh you know it's some type of dog smell smell away it works wonderful it really really does
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well that's good when we moved into this house both dogs and cats had been in it and um we did not realize that there was a problem and after we moved in it was
 		so bad that we had to go ahead and um recarpet the entire house
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and uh when they pulled the carpeting up it was so bad on the back there were so many spots you just wouldn't believe and um they they we had to have a exterminating company come in and they had to treat the concrete slab
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh come on
 	
 	
 		and they had to wear you know gas masks and stuff so we moved everything from one half of the house to the other half and you know then got took took that well actually both
 	
 	
 		now this is from a cat or a dog
 		okay
 	
 	
 		that um took that part of the carpeting up and then treated that and we had to stay out of the ho use for
 		you know ten hours or something and then we came back and then they put the new carpet down there moved the furniture back to that half of the house and had had to do it again
 	
 	
 		because yes dogs need training but cats usually don't even need any training seem like they automatically go to their little litter box they think yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah no they usually don't yeah yeah so anyway we've had that that was a very bad experience  well i don't really think we're going to have any more indoor pets
 	
 	
 		well in fact if we're getting ready to go on our vacation my little six year old now he's saying we need to buy a mother dog to take care of uh
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		Copper while we're gone i said  you don't buy mother dogs you buy little puppies
 	
 	
 		so they'd have company right well it really is fun to have two pets together um-hum yeah
 	
 	
 		and and and my wife's saying uh-huh  no
 		well we had three at one time we had three in the backyard all at one time and they played and they also humped on each other all the time but you know they
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah but they must really have fun together it it's cute to see several several at a time like that
 	
 	
 		oh they did
 		although i'll tell you what it really would scare me like now in the summer when this hot uh when they're playing that hard i you know it's i'm not sure if that was that good for them or not
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but our dog does have plenty of company let me because of the uh we have a
 	
 	
 		just the kids
 	
 	
 		the fence that we have has slats in it so he can see outside and he is constantly chasing the kids and people walk in our neighborhood he's always and we're on the corner too so you know he has a lot of traffic going by and he
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		um-hum
