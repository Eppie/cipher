 		is a bit of a problem i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end i mean how
 		can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are
 		on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending
 		as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more people mean more people than AIDS
 		and yet uh more people die of it and yet the funding is already uh exceeded AIDS has more money than uh breast cancer
 	
 	
 		and well that's interesting isn't it yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh i mean if it's true i i've i've always heard these things i've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but uh
 		i've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that
 		whoever's sitting up there making these decisions uh or whatever institutions raise the money and uh
 		it's just one big PR campaign that yeah we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to AIDS
 		and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years and it's just one of those
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		well of course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not gonna get funded
 		and uh having thought about that for a while
 	
 	
 		what did you think about that idea
 	
 	
 		well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i got i got to thinking
 		the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood antigen antigen uh  antibody test for the antigen in the blood
 		and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years
 	
 	
 		hm they've not really given it attention either yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's not really cure for yeah it's not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major
 		uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it
 		through different organizations March of Dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever
 		how they fund whatever um illness they wish it's it's kind of hard to
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		to get an even keel on that i mean it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or
 	
 	
 		well i'm i'm glad i'm not the one that's  that's in charge of of making those decisions they uh
 		you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious you know i mean it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family and then all the sudden it's the most important thing
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		so i i would hate to have that  responsibility just personally but but then again we really we really do have it as a society just decides which things we need to address
 		i uh
 		i guess i it it frightens me to think  of so many people with with AIDS and with cancer and
 		many of those things um if they're not able to to be insured then the country's gonna pay for it one way or the other
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		whether it's through
 		prevention or or treatment or you know
 		just uh just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves
 		so it seems like one way or the other we're gonna end up paying for it
 	
 	
 		that's true
 		you know the the other thought that i had um i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh
 		i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it so it's kind of a
 		a unfair advantage as they were but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the other thing that i've thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money
 		uh in our economy or in our system uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah they're kind of nice but
 		we have such an affluent society society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a uh cure for just about everything of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but that's
 	
 	
 		just change our priorities
 		right just change our priorities a little bit and
 	
 	
 		yeah you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these  phenomenal amount of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		are they that enhancing for the masses for the masses you know they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but uh
 		had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else
