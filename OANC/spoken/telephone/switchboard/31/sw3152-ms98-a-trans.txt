 		oh so you've heard the Richardson Symphony yeah
 	
 	
 		yes yeah we've heard them and liked liked it real well of course
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		
 
 		do you have a favorite instrument
 	
 	
 		um
 		actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i really like those in fact i had a harpsichord played at my wedding
 	
 	
 		oh did you
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		which was real nice i got married uh during the Christmas season and we we played uh old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not and it was real nice i liked that a lot
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i liked the sound of the harpsichord
 	
 	
 		and it played by itself
 	
 	
 		no somebody played it
 	
 	
 		well i mean but you didn't have oboe or something with it
 	
 	
 		no no no no no just by itself just by itself
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yeah oh well that's really yeah that's i bet that was nice
 	
 	
 		it was real nice
 		yeah it went well it was a change you know from your traditional normal
 		normal normal you know stuff and since it was Christmas time and and uh we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and you know stuff like that and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so we did the harpsichord with old time traditional Christmas carols not not you know the bouncy you know sing along kind but
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		some of the old older ones that some i don't even i recognize the the melodies and whatnot but i didn't recognize the names
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		so
 		it was real nice
 	
 	
 		well actually i play i play the violin in in a string quartet that often plays at weddings
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		so um i always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and it makes it makes it nice it makes you know you can say classy or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else
 	
 	
 		it does
 		it really really does and it it has such a different sound to it anyway it's almost i don't know the way it vibrates it's kind of haunting you know on on some of the notes it it's i'd i like it
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't know how else to explain but we've got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas they're uh called Odessa it's a husband and wife team that we've known for years and
 		we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff too so we've had a lot of
 		stuff you know friends and and things to do with music that constant and plus my husband's real big into music too so he doesn't play anything but
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		he just likes to listen and my dad
 		and my kids are now well my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast and
 	
 	
 		oh now does does the school in in your in your city does it
 		does it offer like band or some of the instruments
 	
 	
 		yeah well my my oldest is only nine so he he hasn't really gotten into um that yet they have choir that they go to you know music class that they go to but um
 	
 	
 		okay
 		right
 	
 	
 		he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet
 	
 	
 		right uh right
 	
 	
 		so i think that starts in sixth grade
 	
 	
 		probably oh gosh
 	
 	
 		so
 		but i don't know he he shows he the only thing he's really shown interest in wanting to play is the drums cause his my my brother plays
 		and um
 		i i don't i don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not you know it's just one of those things i'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		right you got a little ways to go too  right
 	
 	
 		yeah just a little bit
 	
 	
 		great wow well my my oldest is eight and and she's we've started her on piano so uh
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		but that's been it's been fun i mean it's a lot of work to see that she's  prepared but it's been fun it's it's been fun i feel like i've learned a lot about the piano i've learned a lot about playing the piano
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		and uh it kind of makes me listen a little closer to to the piano when i hear it at other places or when i you know see some see and hear someone playing i sort of watch their technique too and
 		and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it's been fun
 		so
 	
 	
 		i don't know if any of mine will be interested in it or
