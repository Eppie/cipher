 
     		
 	
 		okay i i guess first of all i'll just say we haven't done much uh gardening we do lawn work all the time but uh our gardening we lost remember the last two freezes i don't know how long you've been here
 	
 	
 		yeah i do
 	
 	
 		but we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones and so as far as our bushes we don't have any
 		but we do have some blackberry bushes and and they were really hearty and stayed on and we've done really well with them
 	
 	
 		oh really
 		did you plant those yourself
 	
 	
 		um-hum yeah and so they've been really good and the kids i had to  the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		but uh we go out it it's hard to go out when it's this hot
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh but uh keep the weeds out of them and and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them and they're okay
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		yeah um
 	
 	
 		that's nice i i love blackberries and we we uh when i was smaller we my family lived in Tennessee and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my brother and i
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but i don't have any down here
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah uh we have some flowers that have they just are real hearty also and they're bulbs and they come up every year
 		but uh they're getting too thick i need to go thin them out
 		and uh
 		there a i don't know what kind of flowers they are they're real common around here they're they're orange and they look like a lily sort of uh
 	
 	
 		oh i think i know what they i can't remember what the name of them is are are either
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		no but i think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in they they keep the the rain on the outside little rain drops and and they look real pretty after the rain
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i really like them but i need to get out and and um  do that now as far as our grass it grows
 		crazy  it just keeps growing and growing
 		and uh sometimes my husband does it and sometimes my son does it but it just is
 		i don't i don't know i've lived in Utah my whole life and we can't seem to get ours green i don't know yeah
 	
 	
 		down here the grass
 		well i'm uh we've had problems with our yard we it was one big weed is what it was it was just horrible and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns and we have this God awful ugly thing and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		crappy  i know we have that too
 	
 	
 		and i know they must think  you know i wish those people would do something about their yard but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that
 		that seems to be helping and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but we've got a Great Dane in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there she's eaten my crepe myrtle trees
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		i know and she's eaten the bushes i've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there and i barricaded it up so she couldn't get into it
 	
 	
 		
 
 		no  uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i went and took a shower and looked back out there and she was already in it and i was so mad
 	
 	
 		had somehow gotten in  yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		so i can't do anything back there because she just she destroys it
 		but i've tried out in the front but like you said that that freeze that came
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i had some bushes that uh some shrubs i put put out front and it killed those too so i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing i just don't even want to do anything
 	
 	
 		the the other problem that we have well it's funny because the one the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and so i don't i don't know
 	
 	
 		i yeah that that happened to us we have these
 	
 	
 		uh so like i wanted to go out and kill them too
 	
 	
 		i know
 	
 	
 		they had no right to live but anyway
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh under our trees we get a a north sun and uh the it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them you know we just can't grow uh grass underneath there
 	
 	
 		oh i know ours don't
 		i know we can't either but i've got pretty two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and and they're big and  they're real full and everything you know in the summer time but it it's killing everything underneath
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		where the leaves are shading the tree but
 		toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing but by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops you know it's it's it's a never ending cycle
 	
 	
 		right
 		it's a vicious cycle isn't it it's really
 	
 	
 		yeah it really is so we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and and whatnot so
 	
 	
 		well i don't we've never done anything like this but we've been thinking you know if we built up um
 		you know either a a wood wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers or or some new bushes in there that would live
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i think that we're going to try that i i think the
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		i think that's pretty much what we have decided now i have two long windows and i'm trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not you know maybe just halfway up the window or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so people can't see and hear too much  it just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really and i've cut well i don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front
 		and they've got mini-blinds and stuff but only only one is really like in the flower bed part and the other one is out on the porch
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so there's not really much i can do about that
 	
 	
 		that's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows one is a bedroom for our our oldest son and one is um
 		an office that my husband and i work in
 		and so i i really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that well the flowers are out by the back of the house so and that's where the front room is
 		so that's not too bad but i like to look at the flowers they're pretty
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i do too that's why i look at my neighbors yard  i don't have anything to look at so i look at theirs
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		but it's funny because uh you try so hard i think sometimes to to anyway i do to do our yard and then it's like the wind blows
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah it it's really a pain my husband works a lot so um a lot
 	
 	
 		it's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i just  i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it i hate to mow the yard more than anything else i hate to mow that yard
 	
 	
 		i know it is it's not my favorite thing in the world either i'm glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now
 	
 	
 		yeah well mine's getting there he helps he does half and i do half so pretty soon though by next year he should be able to do it all by himself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		whether he likes it or not
 	
 	
 		yeah  well that is one chore that we will pay him for if he'll go do the yard work out outside so
 	
 	
 		oh sure i'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it and and do it to where i don't have to go back out and redo it that that's my only thing with him
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right exactly exactly
 	
 	
 		that's why i'm help having him help me now
