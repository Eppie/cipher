 		we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then uh consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable
 		uh line of credit at our credit union and uh used that as a when the interest rate dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off
 		uh
 	
 	
 		which  which now almost any source of money is lower than a a interest rate on a credit card
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah it's it's strange that that i guess to draw new customers i've seen a few banks in this area have uh oh i guess it was like thirteen point nine or so or some of them were even twelve nine
 		i can't imagine how they made that up made that difference up unless they had a quite a fee on it or some sort of restrictions or every transactions fees or something because
 		that was back when you know eighteen and nineteen and twenty one was prevalent
 	
 	
 		yeah but if you think about it now with what what what interest rates are doing i mean they are so low and yet the majority of the credit card companies still have
 		you know eighteen percent some of them even higher
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh uh you know it it's some of them are almost uh usurious
 		so
 	
 	
 		the last card i got in the last week i got an application for one that was similar to the Discover only it was a gold Visa that offered one percent of your all your purchases back
 		but they had a uh a user's fee of like oh it was thirty five or forty five dollars a year and there was one of the other things they said was so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee
 		if you use it at a uh
 		a different teller than the ones that are at the bank that issues it which of course is an out of state one so that would have been kind of all of mine would have been but the credit union uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that we're with does charge you if you happen to use outside their's but that's there's so many of theirs that it doesn't matter i i hardly i never have that i know of
 	
 	
 		yeah it's like my uh ATM card
 		if i use it at at my bank which uh i bank at my office and it's down in the lobby i've got a these automatic teller machines then it's very convenient i do probably ninety ninety five percent of my uh cash withdrawals there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but uh as of my last uh uh bank statement i had gotten some cash uh from another location and they charged me two dollars
 	
 	
 		yep
 	
 	
 		for that transaction which i thought gosh
 	
 	
 		and if you happen  to check your balance at the same time it would be two more dollars at least that's that's something huh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		the uh the way the Metroplex is laid out i drive by nine other sites before i get to the one i work at and so there's there's several opportunities to use the uh
 		card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and it's real convenient just to run up and get cash fact it's the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that uh i'm with so that's nice to have those around
 		and i only drive ten miles to work so it's kind of a uh one of those situations where they're they're all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		do you have uh do you ever use your credit cards for cash
 	
 	
 		i have done that once and i did it uh gosh i forget why i i guess i
 		i don't know whether i was trying to consolidate something at that time or some reason i took out a thousand on one card and it wasn't too bad it wasn't but uh one percent or so it was one of the MasterCards i had
 	
 	
 		yeah that's well that's that's not a bad deal i to i had uh a card one time that
 		when you know one of these things without my asking they uh sent me a a package you know notifying me that i was such a value a valued customer that they had uh uh put forth this line of credit for me
 	
 	
 		hum
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh
 		you know without reading the small print i found out it was some pretty expensive money before it was all over with because whenever you accessed it through the card
 		uh they tacked on a a charge each time whereas you know i think i only used it a hundred or two hundred at the time if i had gone ahead and gotten a larger amount each time it wouldn't have been uh quite so expensive
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		i guess that's the way they
 		planned on doing it i can't imagine what i it's been several years i can't imagine what i did to uh
 		i do seem to recall
 		uh
 		oh i i know what it was there was something i needed to do something i needed to buy either a uh
 		gosh i don't know what it i don't think it was a thousand now that i think about it it must have been less than that but something i needed and all the other places places were closed it was after hours as it were and
 		there was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind our housing development and they were open
