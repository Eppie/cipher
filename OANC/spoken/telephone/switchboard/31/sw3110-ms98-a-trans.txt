 
     		
 	
 		okay so uh during the summertime do you dress differently than than you would when school's going on
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um a little bit during the school year we're um
 		definitely expected to wear hosiery and you know things like that although we can wear slacks
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		um during during the school year and of course that's a good idea because
 		i do sit on very low chairs to read stories to kindergartners and
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know so it's pretty important to um i also like very much the new split skirts
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		you know because then you've
 	
 	
 		but those aren't that new i mean i have some that were way old  yeah
 	
 	
 		oh that's oh that's true the old culottes that's right but those are just real comfortable and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know allow you the privacy and all
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 		yeah they're very nice do you can you get away with wearing the shorter ones style the ones that really look like shorts kind of
 	
 	
 		
 
 		the only
 		uh no i think it needs to be longer probably if it's split it it varies though between the principal from one principal to another
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		there are some like
 		um some principals insist that you not wear um anklet type shorts
 	
 	
 		oh yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean socks
 		um that you have to wear hose you know hose but i know of other schools
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		where they wear um you know anklets and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well my husband was laughing at me one day because my dresses i when i dress to go to work my dresses are pretty long and um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i couldn't find any hose one day but i found some knee highs so i put those on and the wind caught my skirt and he said what have you got on
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 		how embarrassing i know i hate that you really have to check on the
 	
 	
 		yeah it was real funny
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		check on the length well we wear the knee high ones a lot too so
 	
 	
 		yeah it's pretty comfortable i had never done that and i just i could not find any hose anywhere so
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		the one day that i did it and i got caught
 	
 	
 		do you wear um suits very much
 	
 	
 		um no i really don't my don't i work for a computer company but it's not uh real visual i mean it's not like an IBM where you have to wear your blue suit
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah right
 	
 	
 		but um i can get away with wearing dresses a lot which i really enjoy
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		because especially i mean you know it's nice sometimes in in a suit because if you're hot inside or cold or you know whatever you have your jacket but uh i'm more comfortable in a dress
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so but
 	
 	
 		i am too and i
 	
 	
 		the best thing are you from Texas
 	
 	
 		uh i've been here seventeen years
 	
 	
 		oh well you qualify
 	
 	
 		but i'm from
 		
 
 		but i'm from Illinois
 	
 	
 		oh well see that's what's so funny because so many girls move down here from the north and they have these heavy wool suits and it's like God what do i do with that
 	
 	
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		i said well that's the best part about Texas you can buy uh one dress that you can wear pretty much all through unless like it's the like two cold months and winter in December
 	
 	
 		that's right
 		right all right that really is nice
 		i um i'm kind of a pack rat especially when it comes to clothes
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i i mean i still have some sweaters that i had you know from before i moved down here things that were were wool or just you know really nice things and
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and really very seldom get to wear them and should certainly get rid of probably all of them
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		but like i said i'm kind of a
 	
 	
 		yeah but you'd have to go back to Illinois to have a garage sale
 	
 	
 		yeah that's  that's really true  because who would want it down here but anyway they they still sit around in drawers and boxes and i i get them out
 	
 	
 		really hum
 	
 	
 		at the beginning of the winter
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		out of a box and put them in my drawer and then at the end of the winter i take it out of the drawer and put it back in the box and sometimes i never wore it
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		now that is silly isn't it
 	
 	
 		well that's really weird because last winter i bought my first cardigan that i ever remember buying and i only got to wear it like twice all winter long so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		are you from here then
 	
 	
 		well yeah Oklahoma and Texas so i mean Oklahoma did get colder in the winter but um i guess i just didn't notice it because i never really dressed very warm so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		well the thing is that you know it it does get cold but it's just such a short season you know and you just
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		can't wear that much
 	
 	
 		well and i found a new dressmaker so that i just am crazy about the style of the dresses so
 	
 	
 		oh how nice
 	
 	
 		i've been yeah i mean i go into every store and i i go do you have Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit dresses and they look at me like i'm strange but
 	
 	
 		Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit
 	
 	
 		it's called Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit and they are the neatest dresses they just are very flattering to your figure and um
 	
 	
 		huh where have you found them
 	
 	
 		um i've been fortunate i've found them in in a catalog and then they're a lot cheaper than you can find them at Dillard's
 	
 	
 		um but they carry them at Dillard's
 	
 	
 		so um
 		yeah they do have them at Dillard's and
 	
 	
 		hum i'll have to look at those that sounds interesting
 	
 	
 		yeah i really enjoy them i've gotten i've and it's real funny too because i've had a lot of compliments on them when i wear them so
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum well you mentioned that you liked the long skirts and i i really do too i just i don't know i'm really comfortable in
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		w ell i'm short and i've been told that if you wear the longer skirt it gives you it it gives you more of an elongated look
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so um i've always been more comfortable in the longer ones
 	
 	
 		um-hum i like that too
 	
 	
 		yeah so my my husband's kind of whiny he says well i like the shorter ones  and i'm like well yeah you don't have to sit with your legs crossed all day long
 	
 	
 		that's real good very well
 		
 
 		that's exactly right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so
 	
 	
 		oh well
 	
 	
 		but anyway but i don't have any play clothes because i spend all my money on clothes that i wear to work
 	
 	
 		for work
 	
 	
 		so on the weekends and
 	
 	
 		well you you work year round right yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah but it's just kind of frustrating because on the weekends you want to go out to play and you don't have any play clothes
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i need to kind of acclimate my wardrobe to a lot of skirts and shirts i think where then that way i could at least wear the shirts on the weekend
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's true
 	
 	
 		put them with my shorts or something
 	
 	
 		yeah that's true well i have more summer stuff i guess
 		for that kind of casual because
 		we do go on a  um
 		i go back to Illinois and visit my folks for a week and then we go out to the east coast to visit my husband's
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		mom and family and we usually go to the beach while we're out there so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh in fact i was thinking this summer that since i'm doing summer school i haven't
 		worn hardly very many of those things but i was thinking oh well i got to get them all together so
 		to take them on our trip
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've lost weight recently so i'm now getting to dig out the things i haven't worn for a while so that's kind of fun
 	
 	
 		oh how nice
 		
 
 		well i took i went through my closet this spring and i
 		i took some stuff out
 		and put it in another closet in the guest bedroom because i'm so tired of looking over it and it's all just a little bit too tight
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but it isn't so much too tight i mean i could easily well maybe not too easily but i could lose that weight and then they would all fit fine and you know and there are things that i really don't want to get rid of you know i really want
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		to keep them because they're nice and so i thought well i'll put them in there and then maybe i'll feel so bad that i can't wear them now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and i'll do something about it
 		but so far
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's something my husband says what are we going to do when we finally do have kids and you have to move out of one of those because i i have both of the guest bedrooms are both my rooms and it's like what are we going to do
 	
 	
 		
 
 		
 
 		oh that's funny
 	
 	
 		said well we'll have to get a bigger house
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right  hey when you have kids you definitely have to have
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i know and then plus well my sisters have had their children and so now they send their baby clothes and all their stuff down here to me
 		and i'm like well what am i going to do with all this stuff
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i don't think it will fit my dog
 	
 	
 		you think they're hinting
 	
 	
 		yeah they definitely are but it will be nice if we ever do have kids because then i've got the whole wardrobes and fortunately she's had a boy and a girl
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 		ooh yeah you'll be glad believe me oh because i
 	
 	
 		so that worked out yeah
 		sure i will be because God i was in was in Foley's the other day and i turned the wrong direction and i ended up in the little kids' clothes and i just picked up something for my niece and it was just it was like thirty bucks  i thought golly
 	
 	
 		um
 		oh
 		it's just unreal the time though that it really gets the worst is
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		um is when the kids get
 		old enough that they really care what they're wearing
 	
 	
 		oh yeah i can imagine
 	
 	
 		my kids are twelve and fifteen
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and um you know they're both boys so they're probably not as picky as if they were girls but
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		on the other hand  they can be pretty picky and you know
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i mean i could get away with
 		you know with
 		it not costing nearly as much you know when they were littler because
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		they didn't care
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely
 	
 	
 		anything was fine but you know now it has to be a certain kind of
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		certain kind of jeans and the the shoes are just about the worst
 	
 	
 		oh God yeah i can imagine
 	
 	
 		uh
 		gee um my son just came out the other day and he's his
 		what is it i think they're Reebok
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		whatever my other son has Nike Airs at the moment but these Reeboks
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and i was thinking he bought them in March
 		it was early March he bought them and they are demolished
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i mean they are absolutely demolished there are pieces hanging off of them
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		the inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out i mean that's how worn out they are
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and they cost i bought them on a wonderful sale at Mervyn's they must have been thirty five or so percent off they cost sixty dollars
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 		on sale
 	
 	
 		on that much of a sale
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		and my husband and i were just talking you know it's
 		i mean we're talking minimum of three of those a year
 	
 	
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		that's a hundred and eighty dollars a year for hi s tennis shoes
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh my gosh
 	
 	
 		you know and my husband
 	
 	
 		maybe i won't have kids
 	
 	
 		oh it's just awful and my husband bought i mean this year he bought a pair of of really good you know work leather nice
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		men's dress shoes and they were about a hundred and fifty dollars or you know something like that and you know he said i felt terrible spending that amount of money on this pair of shoes he said
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		but i'll be still be wearing them in ten years
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and and he's i mean we're talking a just a piece of rag
 	
 	
 		oh no
 	
 	
 		so anyway
 	
 	
 		i just can't imagine
 	
 	
 		before we go visit grandma
 	
 	
 		yeah really well my mother had three girls but i don't remember being that picky about my clothes
