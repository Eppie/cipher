 		have you had a family reunion recently
 	
 	
 		yes just this last summer we went back to Utah and we met it was my we usually go to my family reunion but this one was my husband's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they're usually quite similar i think
 	
 	
 		are you both from Utah originally
 	
 	
 		no he's from here
 	
 	
 		oh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um most of his people are from Oregon so we kind of met halfway
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so this was one and they um planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and and had you know things like that have to be planned like they had planned that
 	
 	
 		oh how nice
 	
 	
 		we went to the reunion in end of July June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend but we had to plan everything like clear in December January to reserve that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		sure sure
 		now was this his entire family cousins aunts uncles things like that or his immediate family oh wow oh wow how many people were there
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		no this was everybody
 		oh i oh uh jeez i think over um three hundred were there it was quite a large
 	
 	
 		wow wow
 	
 	
 		it was a great big lodge and so we had plenty of room and everything and and some of them live in that area so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave but um
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that was a great big thing and we do that with his family about every
 		five years a great big one and then like immediate family we do like uh we try to do one thing once a year
 	
 	
 		oh that's wonderful oh
 		now how many how many people are in his immediate family
 	
 	
 		well he has eight brothers and sisters so that's big by itself
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 		wow it really is and you get together once a year wow uh
 	
 	
 		yeah so we have a little shindig with them
 	
 	
 		are they all here in the area or are they scattered
 	
 	
 		uh they're close in a close proximity um
 		uh let's see there are four of them who live here in Texas and his mom and dad
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so um the others live in close neighboring um states like Nevada Arizona i think like that and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		oh wow that's wonderful that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		yeah so it's been fun how about you
 	
 	
 		well we don't really get together i i would love to and that's why i checked that i wanted to do that because i would love to plan a family reunion sometime um i have a sister in Colorado and
 		uh a sister in upstate New York and a sister in Connecticut and here i am in Texas so we're kind of scattered right now
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and um my my cousins have a you know they put on a family reunion um once a year but it's always like the second week in September so it's the kids are already back in school
 	
 	
 		um-hum that's hard
 	
 	
 		and so and that's back in  and that's in New York and there's no way i mean there's just no possible way and it's not really a weekend it's just like a day kind of thing because most of them are still you know um
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		my family moved to Connecticut the rest of the family stayed in New York and uh on Long Island and so they're all kind of local and close and so they just have a you know a day picnic
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh i've always thought it would be so neat even if it were just my immediate family to have like a weekend type thing
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that would be so wonderful
 	
 	
 		it really is fun and my mom's family does it once a year just like you said once a year um they have a a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		a Wednesday through a a Saturday type thing you can come and go as you please type thing and they do that once a year i kind of missed it
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		this year and felt bad but you can't go every year you just cannot do that um
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah yeah
 		and do they they have a hotel or where do you stay
 	
 	
 		um basically they just stay with each other brothers or sisters there are enough in the area to
 		to just kind of span yourself out um whoever's mom and dad it is you usually go and stay with them like i go stay with my mother and
 	
 	
 		take everybody yeah
 	
 	
 		my cousins they just go stay with their mom and dad you know kind of thing and so it's not hard
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area so that's not hard but
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah oh that sounds so wonderful isn't that nice
 	
 	
 		the real planning that's the real key and they send out my mom's family now this is the first reunion with my husband's family i've really been involved with
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but my mom's family each brother and sister takes a turn one year and that's how they divide it up and then
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		from one brother and sister from each family
 	
 	
 		uh she has ten in that family and each one of them take their turn and then the the parent whose turn it is the child whose
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh wow uh-huh
 	
 	
 		turn it is her children help her like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing yeah and um the thing is that um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		oh i see uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh wow
 	
 	
 		the the real part is there are two mailings that go out and the first one is to just kind of give a an approximate date and time so you can start getting
