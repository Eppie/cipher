 		yes yes actually they have one in Richardson that i've been to uh they have real nice lunches have you have you been there for lunch or yeah
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 		yes uh primarily lunch well and breakfast sometimes but uh
 		during the week they often have a a limited menu choice but uh very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety nine that included the soup and or salad
 	
 	
 		really
 		really
 	
 	
 		entrees and accompaniments and dessert and uh the my husband and i like veal uh a lot and their veal dishes have been good we've tried
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		different ones when they've had them
 		as one of the
 	
 	
 		the specials
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		have you ever been to Biffin's
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i keep hearing about it i keep hearing the advertisements of it and and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful i have not been over there and i was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place
 	
 	
 		i yes no
 	
 	
 		over near Plano Super Bowl and uh i've i've not been there
 	
 	
 		right and
 		i haven't either uh one place and i've only been there for lunch but um i went with a friend and we met her husband um down on Greenville down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwin's
 	
 	
 		i've been there
 	
 	
 		oh i we just we it was and we had the uh we both enjoy mushroom soup and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did it was wonderful but um
 	
 	
 		that was nice
 	
 	
 		and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert uh  which was a chocolate sack i don't know if you tried but or something
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i've heard of it where where it's made it's like it's like a it's all chocolate like made like a paper bag and it's filled with what whip cream and and strawberries and something
 	
 	
 		yes
 		it yes it had a sponge cake and whip cream and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh puree and we shared one the three of us and it was plenty because it was very rich but uh i wished i'd had a camera it was beautiful
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh
 		oh i bet it was i bet it was
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		the last time we went to Cafe Pacific it was Father's Day and we took another friend with us and
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		uh  for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves  and so we had they had uh like a
 		berry assortment it was it was raspberries and blueberries and and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and you know they they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the you know how they do the
 		plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it and it was outstanding it was really really relatively simple but oh it was good it was really good
 	
 	
 		yes yeah
 		oh
 		it sounds wonderful
 		well that's uh one of the things the that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant uh i love fresh berries and their
 		uh their fruits are always exceptional i don't i'm know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market uh you can't find them like that and
 	
 	
 		you can't find them yeah  yeah yeah yeah you know i i'm originally from Connecticut and uh
 		i was home a few years ago and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner and i was really amazed you know the the restaurants up there were kind of quaint you know they were real
 		real pretty
 		but they lacked the service and they lacked the atmosphere the just the i don't know the restaurants down here seem like they have uh
 		i guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i thought i would really miss that
 	
 	
 		i would too because well i guess because we don't go out very often when we do go out um
 		in a way it's like a little mini vacation i guess and uh it is it's a whole experience of course you want the fo od to be good but the atmosphere and service i think are important uh too
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		and you know in order to survive in this area i think they have to be good because the ones that aren't so good don't just don't make it
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track but it is wonderful it's called Cafe Max and it's at Plano Road and Campbell
 		they have the most wonderful salads they do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three
 	
 	
 		ooh really
