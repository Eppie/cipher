 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		so uh let's see what what was the topic i forgot oh oh we are supposed to talk
 	
 	
 		advice for people taking for parents uh help their kids through college
 	
 	
 		yeah do you have any children
 	
 	
 		no i just graduated from college yes
 	
 	
 		oh did you where did you go
 	
 	
 		i went to Clarion
 	
 	
 		Clarion
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		huh uh
 		would you i mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or
 	
 	
 		um i would want them to make that decision and i would you know uh i pretty much made my decision on my own and my brother older brother likewise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh you know we we were both pretty much happy with what we did so i think i would not push them towards any one place
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh-huh
 		yeah i know i kind of feel the same way i i just finished college a couple years ago and i uh
 		you know it was while i had my family and everything and it was a lot harder but uh you know i went to a college that was fairly local and i feel like my education you know you get out of it what you put into it i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you know i know it's some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i do not know i guess it a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something i do not know but
 	
 	
 		yeah exactly
 		i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is first of all they have to decide what they want to major in and then you know find a school that's good for that
 	
 	
 		but
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		is that why you picked the school you did or
 	
 	
 		well i picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home so it was far enough away that i was away but yet close enough if i ever wanted to go home i could
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		so you lived there at school then
 	
 	
 		pardon me
 	
 	
 		you lived there at school
 	
 	
 		yeah i lived up at school yeah
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh another reason was uh i paid for my entire education so i had to look for something that i could afford economically you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		you know and uh Clarion was oh it was roughly around six thousand a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh and that was for tuition and
 	
 	
 		yeah that was for everything and now i did not go out a lot and i did not order out a lot and i you know i did not spend money on myself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh then again i was there for school so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and then another reason was i was not sure you know i always wanted to go to school for nursing and then at the last minute i changed my mind
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i knew that Clarion was known you know  for two things actually for their they are known as a teacher's school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and also for their business so that's what i ended up going for is for business uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for business
 		so uh are you working somewhere then or
 	
 	
 		no no not yet i am moving shortly so i am not looking around here
 	
 	
 		oh i see where are you going to move to
 	
 	
 		uh Maryland uh-huh
 	
 	
 		oh are you do you have friends there or
 	
 	
 		my fiancee is down there
 	
 	
 		oh i see
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		so does he work for a company down there
 	
 	
 		yeah he works for the government
 	
 	
 		oh i see oh the big company
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so yeah i i have been working for TI for about twelve years i guess so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		but i am not originally i am originally from Illinois
 		but you know i have gone to college i guess a few different places but i think you know most for the most part
 		you know the teachers have been pretty good and i have got out of it what i have what i have put into it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so
 		but you know i think i think that's most of it personally but that's why i you know with my kids i think that you know i am just going to encourage them to go and i am going to try to help them financially but uh i think you know
 		financially i am there's only so much i can do for them and i will say here's what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		otherwise you can just go for four years you know somewhere and i will try to try to help you
 		but uh
 		i do not know you know the financial end of it like you said i put my wife through school too of course TI paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff but uh it still was a challenge to do
 		and uh
 		so i think you know financially that's that's one of the big aspects
 	
 	
 		exactly yeah
 	
 	
 		you know you
 	
 	
 		it does have a lot of bearing on it whether you are paying for yourself or whether your parents are you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah well did you uh since you were paid for school yourself do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that
 	
 	
 		uh yeah because i was paying for it myself i kind of slacked off because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me you know
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh they pretty much got to the point well well you know you are at that age and you are going to have to decide what you want to do if you goof up it's your fault it's not ours you know
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and then lets me go and i mean i did not do poorly i finished with a two five that's not that wonderful either
 	
 	
 		uh-huh yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh you know i
 		i i mean i worked i did not you know goof around i worked it was just harder you know it was i do not know i was used to being you know on top and when i started there it was like you are mediocre so
 	
 	
 		yeah right
 		yeah well see i think
 		you know i have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it and and i guess it depends on the way you are raised too but if you if you grow to expect that you know you kind of go there as sort of a vacation
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		you know i that's the way a lot of my friends did it and you know they were not they did not take it very serious i know i took it real serious because i did not start to college until you know
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i was about eight or ten years and uh you know out of what i should have been in school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh you know so i think that helped me be real serious about it and i i ended up graduating with like a three point six
 	
 	
 		oh wow that's really good
 	
 	
 		yeah so i you know and that was hard cause i had two kids and you know a family and everything else so i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah see well i screwed myself up also there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know
 	
 	
 		yeah you are right exactly
 	
 	
 		so i went and i just took business well being as i was paying for it myself you know i just kept you do not get into your major until like your second or third year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and i am going into my third year and i decided well i do not want to do accounting anymore right
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i thought oh my God i am paying for this myself i am not switching completely because i will put myself a year behind so i switched to finance and i liked it better
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five you know in my last year my senior year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but i would have really liked to go on uh secondary ed with math education but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself i was not going to put myself behind another year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		right well my my wife was sort of in the same situation she was she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go for
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but you know by then she had practically got her degree so so you know
 	
 	
 		exactly
 		i think if uh i would have went with the math i think i would have done a lot better because i was more interested and that's what i i knew that's what i wanted
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but uh i think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two oh my gosh i would like to see the results on a study done i think they would do a lot better because they are more focused
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		they know exactly what they want to do
 	
 	
 		yeah i think i think you are right when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say man i really need this
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
