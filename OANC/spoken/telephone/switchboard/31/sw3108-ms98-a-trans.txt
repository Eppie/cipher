 
     		
 	
 		well what movie have you seen recently Valerie
 	
 	
 		
 
 		let's see the last one we saw was Thelma and Louise
 	
 	
 		oh we haven't seen that one yet
 	
 	
 		well don't bother  well oh from a woman's point of view and it was very uh
 	
 	
 		oh it wasn't that good hey
 	
 	
 		chauvinistic as far as women go uh oh it was it was entertaining but um yeah i don't think the general audience would would go for it
 	
 	
 		oh well the most recent one that uh my wife and i have seen was the City Slicker
 	
 	
 		how was that
 	
 	
 		that was excellent it was just a really
 	
 	
 		that is one i've been dying to see
 	
 	
 		a really funny movie at the same time it had a
 		story line about people trying to find themselves there were parts that were sad i mean it just ran the gamut of emotion
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh and
 	
 	
 		and but it was just entertaining all around entertaining
 	
 	
 		how how long did that movie run
 	
 	
 		uh it's still on to the best of my knowledge
 	
 	
 		but i mean uh time wise how long was it two hour or
 	
 	
 		oh uh it's i think it's less than two hours
 	
 	
 		uh-huh okay okay
 	
 	
 		i know we we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever
 	
 	
 		oh that always seems to happen when you rent them you know
 	
 	
 		yes but this one it was fairly long i i'm guessing probably an hour and forty five minutes maybe
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh and uh it
 	
 	
 		but excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby uh
 	
 	
 		was it oh good
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		who was the oh Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy
 	
 	
 		oh great
 	
 	
 		so we really enjoyed that
 	
 	
 		oh well i'm looking forward to seeing that one that was next on our list so uh
 	
 	
 		yes i think that uh i can highly recommend that movie this to see
 	
 	
 		okay okay good deal good deal do you rent movies very often or
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		uh  we generally rent a couple a week uh in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on Thursday
 	
 	
 		right right that's exactly right
 	
 	
 		it's so
 		they get they get taken up at the store so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we will rent two or three movies on Thursday and uh with luck you'll have one or two that are good
 	
 	
 		better get yeah right right
 	
 	
 		most of them are a coin flip
 	
 	
 		oh oh God yeah yeah and we usually have
 		oh we don't get out as much as we'd like we have two children so we  occasionally get out to the movies but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it's it's fun it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once
 	
 	
 		yeah well
 		quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends and uh we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh and what ages are they have you found trouble finding movies for them or
 	
 	
 		but
 		uh
 		uh generally we try to stay in the at least PG range the uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		the oldest is nine the youngest is three he doesn't really pay attention and the five year old doesn't have the attention span either but the
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the nine year old will watch anything that's on TV
 	
 	
 		uh-oh uh-oh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so
 	
 	
 		yeah they have been doing that we've been waiting for a a good movie out this summer for the kids to see the last one they saw was Home Alone
 		and uh they enjoyed that but uh i missed that one my husband took the kids to see that one so
 	
 	
 		yeah my wife took the uh i think the kids to see that one but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we can generally find something at the store for them to watch
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well that's a good deal
 	
 	
 		the uh
 		oh
 		we saw this movie Presumed Innocent was the one we rented uh last weekend Harrison Ford
 	
 	
 		okay let me think if i have rented that one Harrison Ford and how does the story line go
 	
 	
 		it's uh he is a prosecuting attorney
 		and uh another prosecutor in the a woman prosecutor in there is murdered
 	
 	
 		oh okay we haven't seen that one
 	
 	
 		and he's trying to find it and it's of course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her so it's and it's an extremely long movie it's over two hours long
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		oh gosh oh gosh
 	
 	
 		which uh my wife enjoy she likes the suspense movies i enjoyed it to a degree
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i think that's the one i wanted to pick up the other day and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me
 		so i thought i better save that one for another day
 	
 	
 		because it's
 		save that for another day
 	
 	
 		yeah because i think he'd like that one you enjoyed that one then
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah i think you it's uh it's something i think you would enjoy yes it's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh okay well that's a good one to put on the list
 	
 	
 		it it's like most suspense movies what was it was on TV recently um
 		Fatal Attraction
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's one that once you've seen it once and uh the suspense there is not really you really can't see it again so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened so
 	
 	
 		right okay
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh okay
 	
 	
 		once once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's it's not good for a second watching particularly
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		at least i don't think so
 	
 	
 		yeah well yeah i don't think too many of them are anymore it's it's a shame but uh yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know we've watched Weekend at Bernie's any number of times  it's just slapstick comedy
 	
 	
 		oh no  oh no  oh
 	
 	
 		
 
 		sit there and laugh and my one grandson and i my wife can't understand it but we like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure
 	
 	
 		oh gosh you know it yeah we've heard about that one but we haven't seen that one either  so well it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies
 	
 	
 		which is another funny one
 		yeah we like to laugh
 	
 	
 		oh God
 	
 	
 		
 
 		oh i i have a theory  i like movies for entertainment i don't want to uh go away depressed from watching a movie
 	
 	
 		right
 		right right i agree i agree
 	
 	
 		life's depressing enough
 	
 	
 		that's for sure
