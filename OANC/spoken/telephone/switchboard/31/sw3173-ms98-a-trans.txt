 		i think our next car i would like something like a an economy car that gets really good mileage and um one that's really reliable i would
 		i think probably not an a brand new car but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra or something like that um something my husband can
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		and of course it has to have air conditioning
 	
 	
 		oh absolutely air air conditioning and a radio uh AM FM and a cassette player and um
 		what else do i want
 	
 	
 		does it have to be a special color
 	
 	
 		um i would think kind of a subdued color would be nice you know a a navy blue or a
 	
 	
 		
 
 		it sounds like something your husband would drive right
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what it would be for is for him to drive
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		back and forth to work
 	
 	
 		yeah well i don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one but when we were looking we were looking for something had enough seat belts of course and we wanted air conditioning and
 		a five speed and that was kind of iffy but that made it better economically so
 	
 	
 		i think that's something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		we'll probably have to look for a another second car sometime and we'd look for about what you're looking for something but probably real cheap it wouldn't be a used used car so but no
 	
 	
 		i think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that um you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed
 	
 	
 		um-hum would you like four doors or it doesn't really matter
 	
 	
 		uh probably well probably probably that would be a good idea
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		hm yeah it it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes so
 	
 	
 		that's right so if we wanted it to take people out with it that's a good thought i
 	
 	
 		it be fun just to win one wouldn't it that would be great alrighty well i i think that's all that we need to say
 	
 	
 		that hadn't crossed my mind
 		yes i would go for that
 		well thank you for calling
 	
 	
 		all right we'll talk to you later bye bye
 	
 	
 		all right good-bye
