 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 		well and
 	
 	
 		well
 		let's see we're going to talk about uh
 	
 	
 		kids in college and how to help them
 	
 	
 		kids
 		how to pick one right
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		well it
 	
 	
 		and you've been through three of those
 	
 	
 		uh three times yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah well i've been through once so
 	
 	
 		well if
 	
 	
 		how did you do it with your three
 	
 	
 		well with uh John the first one he wanted to go into engineering so
 		uh
 		he had never really lived in a large town so we looked at good engineering schools in relatively small towns like Purdue
 		in uh Lafayette Indiana we looked at uh
 		Clemson and VPI
 	
 	
 		where were you living back then
 	
 	
 		we were living in in north Alabama at the time
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		and uh we looked at Mississippi State which was in a small town in Mississippi and uh finally settled on Auburn which was in Alabama in the small town of Auburn
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		we also wanted a school that had a uh coop program
 		because uh he wanted to go into engineering and we thought that a coop program was a good way to get some experience at the same time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so that was kind of how uh we finally settled on small town and good engineering school with a coop program for him for Brian
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it that was kind of funny because he first started out thinking uh
 		that he wanted to go to a small school that's what he thought when we lived in Alabama and then he moved to Plano and went to Senior High
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		he figured if i can go to Senior High i can go to school any place
 	
 	
 		yeah i i think there's a lot of that when you go to a school with two thousand kids there
 	
 	
 		that's right
 	
 	
 		suddenly a college that's small seems i'm going backwards
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so he ended up
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		uh i don't remember what his original major was because he changed it about three times
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		at A&M but he ended up going to A&M i think because of
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh he just thoroughly enjoyed the uh the atmosphere down there when he went down for a trip
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh he was sold on the place
 		Jana i think wanted to to stick a little closer to home
 		and really didn't have a major when she went in in fact
 		i think that was somewhat of a a default because her grades were not as good as uh Brian and John's in high school so she was somewhat limited in her in her choices to places like Stephen F and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		North Texas and maybe UTA and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		she had some idea that she might want to uh
 		do something with uh physical therapy and TWU was also up in uh in Denton so if she started at one she could move to the other and might not even have to move out of her apartment
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so it was kind of close to home and there were two schools in town that uh she could commute back and forth between the two
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		how did uh
 		your gal picked Baylor
 	
 	
 		well i think it was
 		well a little bit of
 		she narrowed it pretty rapidly to eliminate the real big ones Texas and A&M
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and then it kind of got to be a combination of what she thought she wanted to do and uh
 		the uh quality of the program it it you know Baylor was kind of always at the lead there for uh for some time
 		uh she looked at Austin College
 		i think she applied at Trinity but she really wasn't applying at any of the state schools
 	
 	
 		oh what's her major
 	
 	
 		um accounting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it was a bit of of the major but not a whole lot there's a lot of campuses have business majors so that was not a big deal for her
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		but she just uh it was sort of her choice and i think it was a little bit of we visited there and she visited some because her high school boyfriend's sister was there so she had spent some time there and
 	
 	
 		i see
 	
 	
 		felt pretty comfortable she she looked at Austin College but i think again it was the the size aspect it was just too small for somebody
 		coming from Plano unless you you really felt you needed something smaller
 	
 	
 		good one in Plano yeah
 		yeah
 		what is the population of Baylor i don't even know
 	
 	
 		so its
 		uh about uh eleven thousand
 	
 	
 		oh is it okay
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so it's uh it's sizeable but it's
 		it's sort of in the not giant size
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah not like uh Austin and College Station
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah in the case of your kids that i i guess with Jennifer it was more
 		uh that
 		she was making her own choice which i kind of feel is one of the keys if they're going to go do it they better they better decide where with uh
 	
 	
 		yeah it needs to be a place they want to go
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		uh if they're going to be successful if they think Mom and Dad picked it or they're going there because that's where Mom and Dad went and that's what they want them to do uh that's the wrong reason for picking a place
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		that's kind of the way Brian picked his first major i think he
 		without asking me he thought because i was in computer science that he should do the same thing and so he started out in that arena and didn't really care for it and finally asked if i would mind if he changed and i said
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		not at all because you you want to find something that you like to do not necessarily what your Dad does
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		so uh
 	
 	
 		definitely
 	
 	
 		he felt a little easier about that after uh after i told him it wouldn't upset me at all if he found something that he wanted to do rather then copy what i did
 	
 	
 		yeah well it seems uh i don't know of a whole bunch of kids who uh really do what their father did there's some i think doctors may be a place where and i don't know quite why
 		that sons often follow Dad
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		into the profession and maybe that's some of it takes Dad's pull to get an in and other  folks can't get in as easily
 	
 	
 		well that could be
 	
 	
 		but uh i don't have any kids who want to become engineers
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh
 		so uh
 		you just kind of live with it
 	
 	
 		sure
 		well and they they need to do something that they think they will enjoy
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh like i told Jana once she finally settled on a major she just did so much better in college than she did in high school once she found something to get excited about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and uh whether she ever makes a lot of money at it or not is is immaterial if she enjoys it and is good at it
 		and uh so far i think she is
 	
 	
 		yeah well that's the key to it is that enjoying what you're doing and uh you know i think the folks i see having more trouble picking colleges are
 		i got some friends who at Arco there who uh well they're from back east and uh
 		and uh their kids are are looking in on some of those eastern private schools
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when you start looking at the twenty to thirty thousand dollar price tag and you
 	
 	
 		oh i know it
 	
 	
 		start saying well do you really have to go there to get what you want
 	
 	
 		that's right i mean it would be nice if you could but you you can be successful without necessarily having a uh a degree from an Eastern school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but they're from back east and they got a lot of relatives there so it's uh
 		some of them do that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well they feel some uh some peer pressure from their peers the parents do sometimes
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah
