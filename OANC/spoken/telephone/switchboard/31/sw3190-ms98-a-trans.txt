 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		where have you been on a wonderful vacation
 	
 	
 		well normally when we go on vacation we go home to Colorado
 	
 	
 		oh that's where we go home too
 	
 	
 		really yeah Colorado Springs is where we're from
 	
 	
 		that's where we go
 	
 	
 		how funny
 	
 	
 		yes my husband's family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maizeland yes
 	
 	
 		really we live up up uh Lake in the Broadmoor area
 	
 	
 		ah
 	
 	
 		where my family my in-laws are
 	
 	
 		oh we've been there we haven't skied at Broadmoor we went there last year at Christmas time and it was twenty seven below so we had to cancel our ski lessons
 	
 	
 		oh
 		uh-huh as  you can't even ski there anymore
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		yeah they closed it down
 	
 	
 		oh just this year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh they don't have enough money to keep it going it doesn't doesn't pay so
 	
 	
 		oh my
 		ah
 		so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation now if you were a skier
 	
 	
 		well yeah and well now i don't know now Colorado Springs is real accessible to like Breckenridge it's only a couple of hours away and uh so it's it might not be too bad if you wanted to go skiing somewhere else but you can't can't ski up there any more so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		no
 	
 	
 		oh uh i'd like to go on vacation i can't my husband and i wanna go to Florida to go to Disney World but we have two little ones that are under two right now so we wanna wait until they're a little bit older to do that and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yes
 		oh
 		well we went on a family cruise last year on the Premier Family Cruise Line  and then we went to Disney it was all part of the package
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and on the cruise ship they had Mickey and Minnie and Chip and Dale and Goofy and Donald Duck and it was really oriented toward little kids
 	
 	
 		well how fun
 	
 	
 		so the kids could eat with Chip and Dale you know and you know it's just a lot of fun
 	
 	
 		oh yeah oh i bet
 	
 	
 		so then we were on the cruise for three days in the Bahamas and then landed at Cape Canaveral and then drove over to Orlando and spent four days at Disney
 	
 	
 		wow well that sounds pretty neat
 	
 	
 		yes that was the way to travel
 	
 	
 		yeah that sounds pretty good and it was all a big package deal where you just pay one price and get everything
 	
 	
 		yes
 		yes that's right that's right and kids are really cheaper too
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise so they said we could either cancel reschedule or take whatever was available so we took whatever was available
 		and we left a day early  and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton and the ship that was available the only uh rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites
 	
 	
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin
 	
 	
 		oh what a deal
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		so then our cruise was actually extended a day and our Disney was extended a day so we turned a seven day trip into ten
 	
 	
 		great
 	
 	
 		and they paid for everything
 	
 	
 		well that's great oh
 	
 	
 		yes
 		so that was a wonderful vacation
 	
 	
 		yeah i bet uh that sounds like the way i'd wanna do it i think
 	
 	
 		yes
 		well what kind of things do you like to do when you go to Colorado
 	
 	
 		oh well we like to ski of course so we spend so much time with our families uh and seeing our friends because we moved to Texas about two years ago
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do so we don't we don't get a lot of time to just vacation we did um last year though go to San Antonio for Memorial Day
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		oh
 	
 	
 		which was fun just to get to kind of walk around and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh but
 		you know other  other than that with with both my kids being under two it's real hard to do any any kind of
 	
 	
 		right that would be
 	
 	
 		events that that uh don't require  babysitting
 	
 	
 		yes
 		i know i think one of the places i always hit in Colorado is that current outlet store
 	
 	
 		yeah  that's funny you should funny you should mention that i just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it
 	
 	
 		that's what
 		oh with the Santa Claus on the cover yes i've already ordered from that one but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year so
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
 
 		oh do you live where do you what state are you in
 	
 	
 		Texas
 	
 	
 		oh you're in Texas
 	
 	
 		yes i'm in the Dallas area
 	
 	
 		so am i
 	
 	
 		in Plano
 	
 	
 		i'm in Garland yeah
 	
 	
 		uh so that's not too far
 	
 	
 		i talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day yeah so i guess they get people from all over yeah driving for Thanksgiving that's going to be quite a drive for
 	
 	
 		oh
 		yes
 		well it was when we left last year we left on the eighteenth right before that big snow storm hit Colorado and we pulled in just as it hit
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		wow
 	
 	
 		so how do you go do you go up through the Raton Pass
 		when you go up there
 	
 	
 		uh no Raton uh oh well wait a minute yeah we do we do
 	
 	
 		do you
 		that's on like Route 287 or something like that
 	
 	
 		yeah um-hum and then we go straight up through Trinidad and straight up I-25 from there
 	
 	
 		okay
 		okay we uh went a different way when we went last Christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little U-Haul trailer because we had to take our dog in the car there was no room for luggage so we went all interstate we went up
 		um through Oklahoma City
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and then up through uh Kansas and then turned left and went in on I-70
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour it was a little more mile wise
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but because you could go sixty five miles an hour on the
