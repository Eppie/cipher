 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		all right well i am uh the product of uh
 		i think as much the changing roles of women as anyone my mother uh we come from a my mother and i were uh really practice first generation divorce in our family
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		my uh mother was divorced in nineteen uh fifty seven
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		when i was seven years old and was i was the first one of anyone that that anyone had ever known  to have a divorce
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		of course now fifty percent divorces in the United States uh my mother uh was treated very badly uh in a by a lot of people family members um especially from my father's side of the family and also uh
 		uh
 		uh we were uh ostracized by his family uh basically just you know uh we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they all felt that there there was never an issue that my father was the was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce
 	
 	
 		oh mercy
 	
 	
 		uh it was always my mother's fault she was not uh sufficient you know she just was not good enough what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest it was that kind of an attitude
 	
 	
 		yeah that that's too bad
 	
 	
 		so uh yeah it was too bad it was really rough
 	
 	
 		um um that's sad it really is
 	
 	
 		uh so you know that's so changing some of the changing roles of women in that respect i have been a product of
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um i think that there are people that i think that uh i was a i was first generation going to college in my family
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career as a uh uh in a secretarial position she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession profession in Des Moines Iowa
 	
 	
 		that's that's wonderful
 	
 	
 		she was a secretary to uh uh the judge as well as for him so that was a really high high status position she made over thirty thousand a year
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well that's wonderful that speaks well of your mother
 	
 	
 		well yeah she a real hard lady yeah hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know
 	
 	
 		she had high standards yeah
 		oh bless her heart
 	
 	
 		but uh so i went to college and now since have completed two masters degrees and i am the director of music in a church um and but it's interestingly enough i am still everyday confronted with
 	
 	
 		challenges
 	
 	
 		absolutely challenges that have to do with my sex uh for instance uh well you know i am just not taken as seriously you know at professions
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		right
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		as many of the woman as many of the men who are doing the same job i do
 		and uh the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman they expect me to be more motherly
 		they question my authority more uh than they ever would a man and i have experience with this because i work at both both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man
 	
 	
 		uh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so i am pretty i am pretty obvious pretty constant i mean i am pretty aware of what goes on uh in the church so basically that's that's well i am done talking do you want to talk
 	
 	
 		surely
 		well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh Nickie and i can uh relate to that uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh i think it's it's the image that the woman has and uh in the world as uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		the lesser of the two
 	
 	
 		oh always
 	
 	
 		and uh i think things are changing but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		like it to take and uh i think we are progressing at a snail's pace but we are progressing
 	
 	
 		indeed
 	
 	
 		so that's the main point is that we are going ahead
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i think that uh in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		men uh have a lot of them have uh come around and have seen the error of their ways
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change so we have to uh face that reality also
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend i mean why they can not just accept you know competent women i i have never been able to understand that i guess it's fear  i i mean what
 	
 	
 		it could be if they are after they are not sure of themselves
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		the one's that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they know that they can uh you know uh be on the same level
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and they do not have any uh
 		ego
 		uh problems that they are fighting
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		i think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh
 		and i what i would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that yes uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		we each have our uh jobs in life and that we should recognize that and that we should support each other
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and uh i think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal
 	
 	
 		men have a lot of trouble with that though
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they in their in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal and so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals they are they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower
 		uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way and i do not know if that's i mean that's it's a militaristic point of view i guess you know somebody can not be colonel and everybody else is infantry but it's just really interesting to me i am married to a wonderful man
 	
 	
 		uh
 	
 	
 		you know who treats me very you know with a with as i think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time but when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues
 		it's never over you know it's always you said you were going to do something and you did not do it as if he is the boss and i am the you know and i am the slave and it those are the only only issues we ever fight about
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i think it's just i think it's just difficult for men to uh to accept women equally even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss  uh dictator dictatorships are real efficient
 	
 	
 		well i guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us and uh
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i believe that strongly
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and uh but i think that they should be in harmony
 		with what they are with what the subject matter is
 	
 	
 		um
 	
 	
 		and i think the issue should be settled
 		before there's a conflict
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		uh and i think that can happen in a very wonderful wonderful way
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		and if we men and women would do as the Bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves can you picture that
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah it's true
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		that's really the the divine answer and and the right answer  so uh uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that would be a beautiful
 		relationship
 	
 	
 		uh-huh it would be
 	
 	
 		and i think there are some people that
 		have done that and i have seen it and it's it's just marvelous and i am just in awe to see this
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
