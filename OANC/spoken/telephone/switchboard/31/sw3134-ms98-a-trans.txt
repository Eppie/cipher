 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		okay i guess we're supposed to discuss the uh school system that shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us right
 	
 	
 		no as many years as we've been involved in one i really feel fortunate in that there even though there are problems they're not a lot of problems where i teach
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		but from talking to people in other districts there are some major
 		problems uh with dropouts um
 		when i was in Minnesota last summer
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		there was a teacher who said that uh on a given day she didn't know how many of her students would show up and sometimes they didn't even show up for class and she taught in high school in inner city uh Minneapolis
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and uh they just didn't come to school and i cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school
 	
 	
 		that's really sad isn't it
 		right well just recently in the paper here were articles about students um working high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but then the follow-up the next day was i was kind of glad to see  because it it said that
 		you know yes but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible
 		you know and that it seemed to have more to do
 		with other factors
 	
 	
 		i think so too
 	
 	
 		you know like what are their plans after high school you know and what's their home situation you know that
 	
 	
 		the home is the key i think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education and um that the main goal is making money now
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand so um right
 	
 	
 		right
 		sure
 		but there can still be an attitude of you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now but but that the most important thing is still
 		you know getting your education well when they meant said the the topic you know of what's wrong with the public schools my my first impulse impulse was
 	
 	
 		your education
 	
 	
 		it isn't really what's wrong with the public public schools it's what's wrong with families
 	
 	
 		that's right it's what's wrong with families and if if children come to school
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and society in general
 	
 	
 		yes insecure and their more biggest concern is survival
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		both at home they don't know what to expect at home they don't feel secure there they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their
 		apartment complex for example that child that was shot
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		uh how can they concentrate on schooling i agree with you i think that's the main problem
 	
 	
 		right
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		and school's now are supposed to solve
 		social problems uh mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security and that's overwhelming
 	
 	
 		hm
 		yeah
 		well we've got um
 		you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids
 		and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor
 		and that's just really not enough
 	
 	
 		no it isn't
 	
 	
 		and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said oh but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are you know at a tougher and rougher age and all that but you know part of my feeling is that if you solve
 		help them to work through their problems while they're littler then they won't have as many problems up there
 	
 	
 		true i think they there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary we didn't even have counselors in elementary we have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and
 	
 	
 		really
 	
 	
 		they divided them up between three counselors but
 		for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor and they decided that didn't work so they started uh dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum they they do that here
 	
 	
 		through you know through all three years of middle school and i think that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		would give them more security in going to the counselor if they have a rapport with their counselor now if they don't
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		
 
 	
 	
 		i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them on and occasionally that happens
 	
 	
 		to change yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		but it is frightening but
 	
 	
 		yes it certainly is
 	
 	
 		because um education is the key to our future and uh if we have children who are not getting their education for one reason or another
 		than what are we going to do with them what's going to happen to them are they going to be
 	
 	
 		yeah that's right
 	
 	
 		able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them that's no good
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 		i'm on that um campus
 		strategic planning committee for my school and um one of the
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh  you know oh they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things but anyway one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best
 		economic value
 		then i think they decided to strike economic  anyway
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		you know the point was
 		what happens when public education fails you know will then people go to private schools you know well what kind of a situation do they get there and what are you know and what kind of state are we in if
 		if most people are going to private schools
 	
 	
 		well i think uh one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world
 	
 	
 		right
 		right
 	
 	
 		where they don't try to educate everyone that's one of the things that we do we try to educate everyone
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		that's right that's right
 	
 	
 		we're the only country in the world that does
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing you know to work and have uh some ability they can do that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah
 		and one of the Plano school district's you know goal is that they will graduate every child that
 		um that is here in the ninth grade i believe it's something like that it's worded and um
 		i don't know
 	
 	
 		well you know if we can keep them in school
 	
 	
 		right that's
 	
 	
 		then that that helps a lot i think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too
 	
 	
 		so important
 		oh gosh well that new movie that new movie out i hm really really a frightening situation i guess we're both lucky
 	
 	
 		it's scary to me
 		i
 		we are
 	
 	
 		to be in situations and schools where we don't see that my folks talk about it a lot in Illinois my mother was is was teacher for years and year s and um
 		they live in Peoria Illinois and their talking a lot about the
 		you know the school situation there too so
 		well
 		shall we wrap it up
 	
 	
 		um i would imagine that we've talked the amount of time necessary
 	
 	
 		I think we have to so i'll see you when we see you
 	
 	
 		okay
 		all right we were in uh Austin yesterday the reason i was in the church
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and
 		we went to hear uh James Win ensemble concert they left this morning for England
 	
 	
 		oh
 		oh how exciting oh that is wonderful what an experience
 	
 	
 		isn't wonderful
 		uh-huh and uh the university
