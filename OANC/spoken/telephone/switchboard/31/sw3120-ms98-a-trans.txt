 
     		
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		well did you go to college
 	
 	
 		yes i did
 	
 	
 		and where did you go
 	
 	
 		i went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		um it was Sweeper College it was about seven hundred and fifty students i had
 		gone to a small
 		school growing up uh
 		and a lot of my friends went
 		to univerty University of Michigan but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when i graduated and
 		um were looking for a southern school and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um also U of M seemed overwhelming in size and
 		um
 		what about you
 	
 	
 		well i went to the University of Minnesota
 	
 	
 		oh so you're from the Midwest too
 	
 	
 		i am uh-huh where do you live now
 	
 	
 		um i live in Texas now where are you
 	
 	
 		well i'm in Texas i'm in Austin
 	
 	
 		oh um my brother's in Austin
 		um he lives Lakeway he um had moved uh we're in Plano
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i'm familiar with Plano i visited once or twice
 	
 	
 		and
 		oh Austin is so pretty i really like it
 	
 	
 		oh i love it i love it i really do
 	
 	
 		and your daughter is going to be a sophomore
 	
 	
 		that's correct i have two daughters but my oldest will be will be a sophomore
 	
 	
 		is um because you live in Austin is she thinking about the University of Texas
 	
 	
 		she has her heart set on U T
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and um you know having gone to the University of Minnesota
 		i know what a big university is like and um
 		one thing that i did this summer which i thought might benefit both my daughters
 		is my youngest daughter got involved in band and Baylor has a band camp
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so she went for a week and it was overnight and they lived in the dorms
 		and i thought this would expose both of them to what it's you know like on a college a smaller college campus
 		and um my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school
 		so um
 		i i i still think the exposure was good
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought well you know what were your selection criteria did you base it
 		on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or you know there's all of these
 		areas to look at in making the decision
 	
 	
 		um yeah those um and those were several uh
 		that we did consider um my parents
 		uh um certainly didn't push but
 		wanted me to look in the south and because i had been in a small school
 		they suggested that i probably i when i say small my graduating class had eighteen in it
 	
 	
 		oh wow
 	
 	
 		and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 	
 	
 		um or small group situations and
 		i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in
 		biology and i also wanted to spend
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		one year studying in Europe um i had had an A F S student
 		from Germany live with us our senior year
 	
 	
 		oh how exciting
 	
 	
 		i and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and
 		i ended up majoring in French one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department
 		they also had a strong language department and i'd always loved working with children um
 		and
 		i found that i couldn't
 		fit everything in
 		but because i had had a fair amount of French going in i was able
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that
 		interested me um
 	
 	
 		oh that was a that worked out very well for you
 	
 	
 		and so that was some of but
 		several of the things you mentioned were the things that um
 		our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M he's but he thinks he wants to be a writer and i don't think that
 	
 	
 		well then he should come to U T
 	
 	
 		yes
 		um and really his
 		his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um
 		and so he's used to a bigger size and because my brother is there
 	
 	
 		large classes
 	
 	
 		uh he would have family close by so there there are advantages um but i also
 		because i had so many friends who did go from our small school to
 		University of Michigan which was so large and they really felt
 		um like they were numbers
 	
 	
 		oh i went from a large high school to a university large university and i definitely felt like i was a number um i mean
 	
 	
 		you still
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		it is a different feeling but that was that was my only option
 		i i mean i just really couldn't look at anything else that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than a junior you know a junior college which i didn't want to do
 		so that's how you know my decision was made but um
 	
 	
 		well that's that's certainly um
 		especially today with the cost of college i mean that is a a major
 		um consideration and i do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools and even though Baylor um
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		and when you mentioned that we we have friends who have children there
 		who just love it and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are and it is a smaller size and
 		um
 		i do feel like there are a lot of options it's it's
 		but  i had been hoping some schools i know give um
 		oh even this year Jay had an aptitude
 		test um
 	
 	
 		what what does he hopes to be a writer
 	
 	
 		yes he thinks that's what he'd like to do but he's really strong in math and science too and
 	
 	
 		huh
 	
 	
 		we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind does your daughter
 		know what she'd like to do
 	
 	
 		oh she she has uh you know interests that are just you know going in all directions um
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		what she talks about a lot is theater which i think is okay Bethany let's be real  um
 		she really is is pretty unfocused at this point
 		and i don't know she's taken a lot of French
 		and she may end up doing something with that
 		and i am a single mom so
 		i've been and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married so i'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake
 		and i'm you know showing them if you're strong in math and science kiddos
 		this is one area where women can make some decent money
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		you know i mean i'm kind of really putting the practical
 		application you know and and saying yet d o something that you enjoy
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		by all means go get that piece of paper you know do you just have one son
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		i see
 		well it sounds like he's got some really you know good strong ideas of what he wants to do
 	
 	
 		well he but he has even now that he's in high school um and of course there's there is
 		still time but he's beginning to feel that
 		as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it you know it's the it's
