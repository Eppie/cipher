 		Nola in Texas i i talked to someone from Texas yesterday where in Texas you say
 	
 	
 		it's Plano it's just north of Dallas
 	
 	
 		okay you have pets
 	
 	
 		uh oh pets yes
 	
 	
 		do you have pets
 		yeah that's what the topic's supposed to be
 	
 	
 		yeah i didn't quite understand what you said i'm sorry
 	
 	
 		i got my New York accent
 	
 	
 		we don't have uh i grew up in New Jersey but it's been a long time since i lived there
 		did you already push the one okay um yeah we have fish that's it
 	
 	
 		yes
 		that's pretty easy
 	
 	
 		yeah it's uh
 		uh uh neither my husband or i really wanted to take care of cats or dogs or anything like that so
 		and the girls kind of wanted something we have four uh well now we have four girls when we got the fish to start with we had two or three but um
 	
 	
 		what the
 	
 	
 		for some reason i just decided to start a fish tank and set up a ten gallon fish tank and
 		it started with the some uh we had a real hard time getting it established tried the goldfish and they were just filthy could not keep the tank clean um
 		eventually i took them back to the store and started started all over again and
 		i had another couple of kinds that ate each other so that bunch didn't work either
 	
 	
 		
 
 		what type were they like sicklets and stuff like that
 	
 	
 		um  there were some neons and a couple of other kind i can't remember what they were
 	
 	
 		i don't know if the
 	
 	
 		but but they didn't get along very well whatever they were
 	
 	
 		i i had fish that were like they were called sicklets a type of family this is when i was a kid they they had um
 		what are they called like oscars and uh i forgot the different names that they had but they would eat eat they would actually they ate when they got big enough they would eat goldfish we would buy goldfish and feed them to them
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		huh
 		well these were not supposed to be an aggressive kind like that but they were
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		and uh they i could see them picking on each other
 	
 	
 		yeah i i agree with that i i i um
 		i don't really wanna deal with any other pets except for stuff like fish i i thought about i've often thought about getting a fish tank but even that's too much work for me
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		yeah anyway i finally got rid of those those all killed each other off and i cleaned the tank up again and got it all fixed again and so established and i got about half a dozen guppies from a friend
 		and they just bred and bred and bred and they're uh there must've been a hundred guppies in that tank and i had i took i must've taken thirty or forty of them at a time back to the store two or three different times
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		because there were so many of them i couldn't keep them down but
 	
 	
 		and what did they do they they just took them back
 	
 	
 		they took them back and gave me a credit of about a dollar each time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		really yeah that's
 	
 	
 		so yeah helped to buy fish food and filters
 	
 	
 		yeah that's what my friend used to do with his other fish he used to sell them back to the store  they'd buy them but uh that's cool that's
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		but but but uh then i i i i went for a while where um while i was pregnant with  our new little baby we uh i i just
 		kept forgetting to clean the fish tank and it was really dirty for a long time but those fish still lived in there and um
 		finally i cleaned the tank out and most of them had disappeared  um and i don't think i've got any males in there anymore so they're not multiplying anymore
 	
 	
 		that's easier
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah i need to get a new um
 		algae eater though
 	
 	
 		do you do you still you still have guppies
 	
 	
 		yep there's still there's about a dozen guppies in there right now
 	
 	
 		so you you stayed with the guppies
 		great great yeah the fish are fun
 	
 	
 		so but that's the only thing we've got  yes you may i know  sorry and and so you have fish or do you have
 	
 	
 		no i i used to have fish when i was a kid
 	
 	
 		but you don't have anything right now
 	
 	
 		but i don't have anything now i i guess when i moved out of my parent's house i uh gave my fish to my friends and fish tank i think i gave to someone else
 		um but i thought a few years ago go and get one but i've moved around so much recently
 	
 	
 		yeah it's kind of a problem moving them
 	
 	
 		yeah they're not that easy but although it like living in New York City there's definitely no other pet that you would want i mean people some people a lot of people have cats some people have dogs i mean i've i've even seen big big dogs in small apartments and i don't really see that
 	
 	
 		you feel sorry for them
 	
 	
 		yeah someday if i move out into the country i like it like a you know like a Labrador or something like that some you know bigger dog that could kind of run around outside and stuff
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but yeah you see these big dog i mean i see this guy in my building with some i think it's like a golden retriever or something like that and he he's good though he takes him out all the time or her out all the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		you'd have to do it an awful lot though
 	
 	
 		yeah this guy he seems like he runs and stuff and runs with the dog so he probably gets in enough exercise
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		but you know lot
