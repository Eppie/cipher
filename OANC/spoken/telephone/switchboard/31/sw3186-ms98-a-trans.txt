 
     		
 	
 		all right this is easy for me since i
 	
 	
 		
 
 		and me too because i eat out a lot
 	
 	
 		yeah  well i travel i do about forty percent of my time is on the road
 	
 	
 		so you eat all your meals out
 	
 	
 		i eat a lot of meals out um well i'm also married my wife is  A1 cook but she enjoys eating out so i have to
 		share it with her  and uh actually it's very easy for me because i i have a practice make it a practice when i am out i eat differently than what i could eat at home or around here
 	
 	
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so so i look for just about anything and it's it's uh
 		it's a lot of fun i don't have to worry really worry too much about price considerations because i you know
