 		oh on a number of people's minds and often times when peoples talk about cutting budget or wishing that the government didn't spend money here and there i hear them talk about uh cutting
 		what they call aid to some foreign countries and people don't understand why are we give a million here or a billion there and
 		and whether they like it or not or whether they understand it or not the government just simply develops dependencies on us uh you start giving a country uh
 		x amount of dollars for so many years and their whole economy and their whole
 		uh system is uh used to it and then you threaten with whatever
 		you wish you know you would say well you're not acting right we're gonna withhold it or you're not doing this that or the other or we want our base here or we want whatever
 		and the government's been doing that for years and will probably continue to do that for years and i'm not sure if the general public uh
 		thinks about it that way when they start saying why did we give money here or money there and but there are some things even when we what we spend in inside the US it seems a little
 		far fetched and not necessarily for the common good
 		uh lot of the money for the arts seem to benefit only a few
 		and usually those who are um
 		rich anyway or have enough have enough money to attend those kind of functions
 		so it's  that's a a controversy of course there's only a hundred and seventy million going to the NEA but a hundred and seventy million's
 		a bit and it's something so
 		what would you do or cut or change in the budget
 	
 	
 		well
 		
 
 		um i agree with you on the international aid and um
 		i don't think a lot of people realize too on we can't live isolated our world is such an international economy now and um
 		uh especially with the problems in Eastern Europe and Russia
 		uh
 		i know a lot of people feel that we've given so much aid and we have so many economic problems and and i agree that we do but um it's also in our country's interest um
 		to have a balanced world economy um sometimes it does seem like we're the ones doing all the giving um and i have to admit sometimes i have wondered if uh
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		we run into problems which is is certainly a possibility if anyone would come  to lend us a hand but um
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		
 
 		i do think uh
 		this is a hard area i'm there's some areas that i feel uh
 		need a lot of work um  and improvement and education comes to mind i know they are working on trimming defense um
 		this has been such a long process that has gotten us to the point that we're in
 		but unless they start working on it um
 		it really it it already is is close to uncontrollable
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		but i'm not sure exactly what practical
 		uh steps
 		uh could be um i wish i had some of the figures in front of me now to know the percentage um
 		i do think one step once something you touched on in talking about the arts is that as far as percentages go i think uh money should go that benefits
 		the most um i say uh i believe in um education and not necessarily the
 		federal um it can be done on on different levels too because i think that's our future if we
 		um if our education system falls behind that of say Germany and Japan and um
 		some of the other countries we need to be able to be competitive um
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		it's that's an area i would not want cut
 		there are a lot of areas i think that money could be better spent i think sometimes the money they spend on studies to decide on things is way out of proportion and and of course everyone's heard the stories of the
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		several thousand dollar hammer and um you know somewhere along the line um
 		there've been some
 		gross errors
 	
 	
 		most of the the national or the federal dollars that go toward any project
 		uh people tend to want accountability but they don't want the so-called bigger government so they they wanna have fewer government employee
