 
     		
 	
 		well basically uh did you wanna go first then
 	
 	
 		
 
 		uh well i can i i don't own my home um
 	
 	
 		okay right
 	
 	
 		so i mean i i live in a nice area and i rent my home and uh we aren't sure we're gonna buy a house yet because we don't know if we're gonna be staying here
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		sure uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in uh Texas so
 	
 	
 		yeah i think as far as like our home is uh in a small residential area and we're out of the
 		cities quite a ways so it's kind of more of a country setting and uh it's just a typical um
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		three bedroom type of home it's it's nothing you know elaborate where it has uh this or this or you know it's it's just a typical home with uh three bedrooms uh two story type home and um
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		and i think as far as if it if we're put it into standards of uh what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are um
 		there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet there's
 		where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is so it's uh pretty much that uh type of um home so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah well our home our house we we're renting it from an individual who bought it and he lives in Korea and and uh he's recently moved here and he's owns eight or nine properties
 	
 	
 		uh
 		uh-huh oh really hm
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh near here and uh so but the houses around here there's five five houses on my street for sale right now
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		yeah
 		oh yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		which is just uh incredible incredible to me and they're not very expensive either it just seems like we we have a three bedroom house ours is one level only um but we
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		um-hum so it's a rambler style
 	
 	
 		yeah we have two two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen and the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom's a little bigger so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		yeah yeah it's kind of like what ours is uh our one of our bedrooms is really small and we've made that into a den because we only have one child so that was our best way of going with uh the small bedrooms because they are making
 		bedrooms smaller and smaller it seems like they get incredibly small um but uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		anyway but okay that sounds great and uh i don't know if we need to talk anymore or whatever
 	
 	
 		have you done have you done this before
 	
 	
 		the TI um yes uh about three times and so i'm fairly new to it but it seems to be going okay
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh have you
 		yeah are you in Texas no yeah
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh no i'm out of state i'm in Wisconsin so yeah yeah so its

 		sounds interesting
 		no huh-uh i've oh i've gotten several calls um but uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		i'm the always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because it's like i can get it done with i don't have to wait until somebody called me even though i have a feeling what's gonna happen is i'll probably get tons of calls you know so
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		sooner or later
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah well they've i've talked to some people from Cleveland and i did talk to someone else who lives here uh in the same city i do so that was kind of interesting
