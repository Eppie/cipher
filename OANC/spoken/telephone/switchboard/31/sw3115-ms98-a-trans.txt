 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		all right and and your occupation is teaching
 	
 	
 		i'm a i'm a substitute teacher is is this Pat i'm talking to now yeah i'm a substitute teacher in i believe the same school system we both work in
 	
 	
 		substitute teacher
 		yes it is it is uh-huh
 		right well i was just trying to make an introduction here
 	
 	
 		oh okay
 	
 	
 		but oh and and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year now
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		i've just gotten a another job at an elementary library at Barron
 	
 	
 		well i bet you're you're you may dress differently then for that
 	
 	
 		right i well not really i've got the every day i've got to uh read to kindergartners so i'm going to be down on the floor with them i've got about forty kindergartners i'm going to be doing working with every day
 		for uh you know a half hour so i'll be i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do
 		because i'm i'm if i'm going to be down on the floor messing with them i'm not going to wear nylons and you know nice nylons and dresses
 	
 	
 		well
 		what i wear sometimes depends on on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in since i'm a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater
 	
 	
 		right
 		well of course you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold
 	
 	
 		yes
 	
 	
 		but you don't know uh
 		i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there
 	
 	
 		you know you try to layer so you can add or or or take off
 	
 	
 		subtract right
 	
 	
 		and it's it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual
 		uh
 	
 	
 		i i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools that's one of things one of the things i ask about
 		you know whether whether she would allow slacks and she said she doesn't have a problem with that she just didn't like sloppy dressing
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and and i said well you know that was okay and i'm basically i just you know i wear slacks year round except every about once a week i try to wear a skirt and and in the winter you know i just add a
 		maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer and add a heavier jacket or you know wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's about
 		i don't i don't really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and
 		you know look really
 	
 	
 		right and well for me sometimes they even have dress up days or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different outfits and you have to have the color for that particular school if you if you choose to participate in spirit week
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right right
 	
 	
 		and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some
 		sort of hat
 	
 	
 		and you never know that though sometimes when you're going in do you
 	
 	
 		no but because i sort of stick to several schools uh i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it and then many schools on a particular day during uh
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for uh game day which
 	
 	
 		right on what Thursday Thursday
 	
 	
 		right it might be Thursday for the high schools and it may be Friday for the senior high schools
 	
 	
 		right right so that would kind of give you
 		a clue i guess and and sometimes you get the long term stuff so you're aware ahead of time
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		of what's going on that so that's
 		and i don't know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties
 		and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the teachers i know wear uh
 		dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease and uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top and and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i don't know that that looks that bad but if you're going to tell the kids they can have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too
 	
 	
 		yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but it i think it varies it it just so much anything anything can go
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at Clark they're all pretty fancy
 		but they're just sort of into clothes and then there's other departments that aren't and they'll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might
 	
 	
 		right right right
 		yeah there's a couple teachers up there that that do dress up more than others right
 	
 	
 		might say
 		right
 		and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're  going to be in the same room with them
 	
 	
 		right
 		well and you always course it's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today or there there's
 	
 	
 		
 
 		or you're going to be observed
 	
 	
 		there's usually yeah there's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i don't know how a coach would feel if that teaches health or
 	
 	
 		
 
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		English you know English or whatever that they had to wear a tie i some of those male coaches that might really
 	
 	
 		right they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants
 	
 	
 		right and a T-shirt
 		right that i didn't ever understand i mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so
 	
 	
 		yeah well at Vines the coaches don't do that they they dress pretty good i would say and then they go to their coaching and they they put their shorts on there
 	
 	
 		whether
 		change then well see that's what i would think
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		that's what i would think
 	
 	
 		but they they don't look you know they don't wear their sweat pants or or anything they're they dress like any other teacher would in in a classroom situation not in PE
 	
 	
 		right
 		course we had had one coach one period he'd teach PE and the next period Health and then a period of PE and and that's hard you know so he just left warm-ups on but
 	
 	
 		those i can understand yeah
 	
 	
 		but uh no i think really probably they could they could uh
 		really and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and
 	
 	
 		i don't think we'll ever get to that no i don't think i think we're going the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that i guess many times they've had uniforms for years i really don't really know if they still do
 	
 	
 		you don't think so
 		well some of them yes they do and and it's not at some of the private schools but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress in accordance with that
 	
 	
 		it certainly makes it easier to dress
 		uh-huh
 		well it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		well i i think it would make a difference at school i i don't think we should be spending time
 		saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts too shorts too short or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high you know i mean
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it's a lot of trouble to to take care of that and of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what i want and and yet we can't to that either i'd like to see them go to to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear
 		a button down shirt you know that would that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks
 		and they could buy th em anywhere they wanted and you know and
 	
 	
 		yeah but i doubt that that would come about that that will come about just  i yeah i i
 	
 	
 		and then the girls could
 		right i don't no not in Plano
 	
 	
 		no not yeah
 	
 	
 		they may get away but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there
 	
 	
 		well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete
 	
 	
 		Highland Park's thinking about going that route
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so it
 		and then i think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do
 	
 	
 		yeah i i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional but
 	
 	
 		yeah i agree with you on
