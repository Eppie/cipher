 
     		
 	
 		okay we're on
 	
 	
 		okay well i just on on gun control i just always felt like that i think
 		i don't think it hurts for anybody to wait for a week or two before they get a gun if somebody goes in to buy one so that they can check that person out um
 		i don't believe that most of the criminal acts that are done are done by guns that are bought in a gun shop though i believe it's probably
 		bought across the market and i don't think gun control is gonna have any control over that at all
 	
 	
 		so uh you're you're for no restrictions or
 	
 	
 		uh uh sort of a a little bit of restriction maybe i might say
 	
 	
 		
  
 	
 	
 		if a criminal if a criminal should go happen to go into a gun store i don't think it would hurt anybody to wait a week
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		to go back and pick up that gun so that they can check them out
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		right
 	
 	
 		and if it is somebody like that then no but i really think that most of the criminals in our city who have guns do not go into a gun store and buy them i think they get them from other means
 	
 	
 		i what kind what what kind of means would those be
 	
 	
 		oh i don't know like from each other you know uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh in other words you're saying that it would be hard uh to get rid of all of the guns
 	
 	
 		
  
 		i think so
 	
 	
 		well doesn't it doesn't doesn't London have a ban on firearms
 		England
 	
 	
 		jeez now i don't know
 	
 	
 		yeah don't they carry don't their policemen over there carry these billy clubs
 	
 	
 		that's right nobody over there carries guns
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		i don't know if we could get away with guns completely i guess
 	
 	
 		well it would be nice uh uh to be able to take your family out uh especially when they're dependent on you and not worry about uh having to have a gun just to protect yourself and them
 	
 	
 		that's right i agree with that i agree with that i we do not own one um
 		and i don't intend to buy one and i'm not a hunter i guess those people feel a little bit different but i don't believe in hunting either so  you know
 	
 	
 		well i have a couple of guns and uh one i always worry about somebody getting ahold of it that that you know won't know how to handle it
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and uh probably never will do me any good because the bullets in one place and the firearm's in another
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i carry one in the pickup uh and i worry about it being stolen and uh of course i'm like you i don't like to kill things
 	
 	
 		no i don't either  well it is terrible when you have to ride down the street and think somebody could just shoot at you for nothing which has been in the news a lot lately you know no apparent reason
 	
 	
 		so
 		
  
 		oh yeah and and there's a lot
 		the crazies are out there in numbers
 	
 	
 		right right
 	
 	
 		well you know i would love to see a ban uh on firearms and i'd have to rate myself as a number one however i worry that that the that the country could ever get to that point
 	
 	
 		hm
 	
 	
 		and then i worry about uh the fact that uh what if there was some sort of insurrection in this country in this country
 	
 	
 		yeah
 	
 	
 		then uh how would we as citizens uh band together and ever put down an uprising if there were no firearms
 	
 	
 		uprising
 		you think we could ever get to that point where there would be no firearms
 	
 	
 		i don't think we ever will
 	
 	
 		i don't either that's the problem not in this country
 	
 	
 		yeah so somewhere somewhere along the line then uh you know there has to be a happy medium and uh i know the the uh oh what's the organization that uh
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		that the rifle association
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		the gun the uh the gun association is is heavily for no bans whatsoever
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think we ought to have some
 	
 	
 		yeah well i think so too so i'd have to vote for uh uh maybe a five in uh and hopefully uh we could put some sort of restriction on the handling of firearms
 	
 	
 		right i could go for that
 	
 	
 		like like you suggested
 	
 	
 		yeah i think that would i think that's the only way
 	
 	
 		okay Betty well sounds good enough to me then
 	
 	
 		well
 		i've enjoyed talking to you
 	
 	
 		well same here and uh one of these days that name's gonna come back to me
 	
 	
 		
  
 		oh me me too okay bye-bye
