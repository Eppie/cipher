 		hello
 	
 	
 		basically i wear pants i'm a real pants person and um like when i'm at home since and and i'll say i'm a homemaker
 		since that's my basic thing um
 		i wear a pantsuit most of the time not a pantsuit i guess pants and a shirt
 		and um in the summertime i wear cotton tops cotton top shirts and in the winter i wear uh like sweaters i like sweaters a lot
 		and so i do that but when i go out for meetings
 		uh then i will wear  either uh skirts or um a dress
 		and i have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time but
 		that's basically what i do
 	
 	
 		well i think our tastes are fairly similar similar although i'm i government worker i do tend to i'm um a scientist
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		so that technically i suppose i could get away with with extremely casual clothes but for the most port part i don't i wear fairly respectable looking shoes and
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 		right
 	
 	
 		and a pantsuit of sort one sort or another
 		and um
 		i guess dress it up with a with a a very nice black jacket when i have some have visitors or have to give talks
 	
 	
 		well that sounds nice
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		um it said the seasons do do you change much through the season or
 	
 	
 		no actually i guess this summer i i wore some fairly nice jeans um more than i wore have in previous seasons
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but um no i tend  to to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer
 		i don't know whether they think by
 		you know freezing them up overnight then they can save electricity during the day or something  but but you know you wear a heavy sweater in your office all summer  so
 	
 	
 		maybe i don't know
 		
 
 	
 	
 		right um yeah i don't i don't
 		i you know i'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i guess although in as i recall the stereotype of of secretaries was you know overdress overkill sort of and
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		in a sense uh in a sense the people i know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries
 		although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and they're not meeting the public
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		it i find it a little bit strange that their priorities would would be to spend this money here
 		you know  i mean i suppose if you were a a more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		then maybe
 		yeah
 		um well i don't have the resources to just go out and buy buy buy anyway  and so my note change dramatically over the years if i need something new i will go and buy it
 		but basically i'm a a pretty much the same in the summertime i wear the light cotton and in the wintertime i change to the sweaters
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		and so it's not a whole lot of of change for me either
 	
 	
 		right
 	
 	
 		and um especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses i
 		i i enjoy that but it just wouldn't be um
 		smart for me to do that in my home with my children
 	
 	
 		um-hum um-hum
 	
 	
 		so i have to um
 		think about things like that too i have given seminars before in in creative writing and things like that now i don't know if they consider that a job i don't really get paid for that
 		uh often but uh when i do that then i i think i become more businesslike
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		um but it doesn't really change in my clothing style
 	
 	
 		exactly i mean you can look businesslike in in a pantsuit uh the same pant suit you would you know wear for other things
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 	
 	
 		yeah i'm i'm really glad about that pantsuits are popular because i'm allergic to many of the synthetics
 	
 	
 		oh
 	
 	
 		and so i used to have a problem when when i was working in a restaurant while i was in college and had to dress up and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		oh dear
 	
 	
 		so
 	
 	
 		that's not helpful
 	
 	
 		right right but otherwise now i'm i i guess we're both pretty practical
 	
 	
 		yeah i guess so  well it's been great talking to you have a great day bye
 	
 	
 		okay well have a good day bye-bye
