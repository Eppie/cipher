 
     		
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		
 
 	
 	
 		uh do you want to give a start on it
 	
 	
 		well i think for me i i'm from Alabama south Alabama and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		
  
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		uh in a pretty liberal family for for that area at the time
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so i was very much a part of all the uh  you know what was going on there uh
 	
 	
 		uh-hum
 	
 	
 		my parents are pretty active and uh it was very scary and but now we've seen you know  uh black people have a lot more civil rights
 		in that area and i guess all over than they did you know twenty years ago
 	
 	
 		oh definitely
 	
 	
 		there's still a lot to be  you know to be accomplished but
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		for me when i think about social change that's what i first think of because i can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		you can relate to that now see we didn't we don't have any of that because well like we live in the country
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		in Clarion County and uh
 		we really didn't have things like that going on that we you know uh ran into
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so we kind of uh i guess when i think of social changes i think think more of uh
 		
 
 		uh visiting habits of families and such uh uh
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		well that's true
 		that's a good one right there
 	
 	
 		yeah that there's less visiting done i think on a whole than there used to be used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not you went visiting
 		and uh today you know people they do visit but it's not quite the same as uh what it was say twenty years ago thirty years ago
 	
 	
 		right and i grew up in out in the country too basically in a rural area and with lots of family
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so we were always at family in different people family members' homes but even now you know they don't even do that
 	
 	
 		right
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		well they're so spread out i think has a lot to do with it
 	
 	
 		well and they're so busy people people's personal schedules are so busy
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		mainly because i a lot of it has to do i think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked and now uh almost all the women work
 	
 	
 		right right
 		that's right yeah
 		the majority yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and so that means you know a lot of  a lot of the social visiting and all was i think probably instigated by women at that time right and now
 	
 	
 		probably because when you work
 		you don't really care to go out and visit as much
 	
 	
 		that's right and now uh i mean my mother does not work and and she you know she's finds finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women
 	
 	
 		and uh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but even just social visits people don't do that anymore you're right and people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore
 	
 	
 		no huh-uh they don't do as much
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		there's a real
 	
 	
 		you have to make arrangements or have an invitation or
 	
 	
 		right you know you don't want to you want to make sure it's okay or i guess we don't not to make invade people's privacy or whatever
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah
 		well that could be part of it i don't know for sure what it is i know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance so
 		we really don't have that even we don't yeah
 	
 	
 		well out of out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us don't live within fifty miles
 	
 	
 		oh really
 	
 	
 		and that and most live within ten or or twenty so but that's you know that is rural it's a rural family and
 	
 	
 		oh that's pretty good yeah
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		most people didn't go away i'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live in the you know even in the same state
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		well apparently there must be work available
 	
 	
 		yeah there is in that area
 	
 	
 		for those that are
 		uh-huh because around here there's really nothing for the young people no good i mean there's jobs there's minimum wage jobs but uh to make a good living there really around here there just isn't too much
 	
 	
 		um-hum and i guess you know that would greatly affect social change i use social change probably the job market has always and the the economy has always affected uh social change
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		probably
 	
 	
 		so  well there's the main things i can think of i really
 		tried to think of some other things and i couldn't really
 	
 	
 		well i think just also you know
 	
 	
 		that
 	
 	
 		the women's movement too has affected a lot of social change uh people marry
 	
 	
 		yeah definitely some good and some bad
 	
 	
 		yeah people marry later
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		i mean basically i think now again where i'm from in in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but now out here in Texas where i am now that's very unusual
 	
 	
 		they'd rather get their life started first before uh-huh
 	
 	
 		most people get married i mean get go to college or at least get a job and even you know people are seem to a lot of people seem to
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		yeah well even to get school finished i think a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in because a marriage takes a lot of
 		effort and concentration  and if you're busy with school it's i think it's really difficult for a family
 	
 	
 		right but probably uh you know more women being in in the work force also greatly greatly affects social change because it affects child care and uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh uh-huh
 		right right
 		yeah i know my my daughter that lives in Pittsburgh she has two little boys and they they've been in day care since you know one's four and one's one
 	
 	
 		but
 		right
 	
 	
 		and they've done well  now i wouldn't want to do it that way but uh she's quite happy and the children seem quite adjusted
 		and uh
 	
 	
 		well and they're you know they're they're saying right now we don't know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		that's right yeah
 		uh-huh yes uh-huh
 	
 	
 		they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care and so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that what that does
 	
 	
 		that's right yeah
 		uh-huh now i'm going to babysit my granddaughter she's just eight weeks old so this will be new for me
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		so uh
 		but the others i'm too far away to help them out at all
 	
 	
 		where do they live
 	
 	
 		uh well i have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh one in Maryland and one in Connecticut a son in Connecticut
 	
 	
 		well they're not too far though
 	
 	
 		no but like Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home and uh it's too far to you know really go too often
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		Pittsburgh's not quite so bad it's just a couple hours
 		Maryland maybe five hour drive
 	
 	
 		well i live like fourteen hours from home in fact i'm
 	
 	
 		that's
 		uh-huh that's worse yet
 	
 	
 		i'm driving tomorrow i'm i'm driving home tomorrow so to go be there for the Fourth of July
 	
 	
 		oh are you really
 		do you uh stay overnight on the way or you
 	
 	
 		no i can drive it all it's just me so i can make it i'm thirty five
 	
 	
 		you're young how old are you
 		okay well you're young enough yet to
 	
 	
 		although it's it's it is pretty i don't know i don't enjoy it that much it's pretty much like get there and
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		it's work to get there yeah yeah huh
 	
 	
 		it's just not that pleasant even with other people i basically just don't like to drive that far
 	
 	
 		uh-huh now my son they they flew he rebuilt a Aranca Chief airplane and they flew down last weekend they came down in it
 		and it still took a long time because it's not a fast it's not a high-speed airplane
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		but they enjoyed in thoroughly
 		so
 	
 	
 		when you say you're in the second phase of this project what is the second phase of it
 	
 	
 		i'm not sure but you have to change phones you have to call from another a different
 	
 	
 		oh
