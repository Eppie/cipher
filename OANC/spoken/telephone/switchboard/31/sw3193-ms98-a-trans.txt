 
     		
 	
 		okay well basically my habits are totally gone i used to exercise quite a bit and now i have a child and and um trying to do go to school back to college again so it's
 	
 	
 		okay
 	
 	
 		it's uh exercise is kind of forget it
 	
 	
 		well it
 		but if it well if i remember back to when i had a child they give you a lot of exercise just  what age is your child
 	
 	
 		they sure do yeah my daughter
 		yeah yeah uh she's three so three with a i think it's almost like she's got this endless
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		energy i mean it's no longer nap time that kind of thing so
 	
 	
 		oh she's given up the naps
 	
 	
 		yes yeah so
 	
 	
 		oh i remember  i remember mine doing that that's terrible
 	
 	
 		yeah
 		exactly so the exercise we can pretty much uh get from her uh she always wants to go outside and do things so i'm kind of uh she's an only child too so it's it's not like you can say go out and play with other kids so it's
 	
 	
 		oh  right and so many people work nowadays there you know there's not that many kids in a neighborhood necessarily anymore either
 	
 	
 		
 
 		um-hum sure sure
 	
 	
 		but well my main uh exercise the only one i've ever stuck to at all is walking
 	
 	
 		yeah uh-huh
 	
 	
 		and i  try to get out and walk two miles
 		most everyday but but it you know it fluctuates i'll do real good for a while and then i'll be off of it for a while just depending on what's happened but the last uh
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		um-hum sure
 	
 	
 		couple of uh years uh my husband is an accountant and he moved his office to the house and i work for him
 	
 	
 		um-hum sure
 	
 	
 		so that helps because we're at home and i can get out and walk a lot better than when i was working in an office
 	
 	
 		sure
 		sure
 	
 	
 		so that has helped
 		but anything else uh
 		well we have a lake house and down there when we go down there some on weekends we get a different type of exercise you know just  doing a lot of work and things down there
 		but that and uh and walking is about it
 	
 	
 		yeah yeah that's about what uh basically if we can get out and take a walk it's
 		it's great but uh most of the time we can't so it's uh we're too busy doing other things but that also takes into account of walking though when you think about it so it ah
 	
 	
 		um-hum i will admit though when i
 		do walk i feel so much better you know when i get out and do that two miles it takes about thirty minutes just our neighborhood is just kind of very flat land with sidewalks and
 	
 	
 		oh sure
 		sure
 		uh-huh
 		sure
 	
 	
 		uh i really do uh and and i smoke and i can tell that it just immediately if i've been coughing or something you know it just immediately seems to clear my lungs up
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		uh-huh
 		to loosen it up yeah yeah that's true
 	
 	
 		but um
 	
 	
 		so yeah
 	
 	
 		well i got a lot of exercise though the last four or five days i have two grandchildren
 	
 	
 		oh yes
 	
 	
 		three months and nineteen months and my daughter and son-in-law went on a
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		trip for three days and left them with us and we nearly went nuts
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 		so oh boy
 		sure trying to keep up with the nineteen months uh sure they're into everything
 	
 	
 		well and the baby was sick so he wasn't good you know so it took was one on one i mean i had to take one and he had to take the other one and it was busy
 	
 	
 		the baby hm
 		oh he was cranky
 	
 	
 		and they woke up all during the night  and i'm not uh used to that
 	
 	
 		sure once you lose that sure that's very true
 	
 	
 		uh-huh
 	
 	
 		it wasn't too long ago where i was doing the same thing and that uh totally gets your mental capabilities uh thrown off totally when they're
 		uh tired and uh you wake up in the middle of the night and it's my daughter used to be pretty much on a regular basis for that so
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		daddy just came home so the house is starting to liven up here now  but uh that's about it that's kind of how my exercise is right now is just basically running after a three year old
 	
 	
 		um um-hum
 		right uh when you were talking about mentally losing sleep it also made me think of one other thing walking
 	
 	
 		so
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		does for me when i do it it does help me mentally you know if i'm worried about something or whatever and i get out and do that
 	
 	
 		um-hum
 	
 	
 		walk it just i don't know it just sort of helps your mental attitude too
 	
 	
 		it sure does yeah
 	
 	
 		so i miss that when i don't do it
 	
 	
 		sure sure well it was really nice talking to you then
 	
 	
 		but
 		well nice to talk to you
 	
 	
 		okay um-hum thank you um-hum bye now
 	
 	
 		bye bye
