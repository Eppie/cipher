         It's a very small town that didn't or doesn't have a post office, doesn't have a grocery store, really only has a school and two gas stations.
         But we actually lived in the city of Easley and went to Pickens High School, but had also a different phone number.
         But anyway, there's some background of the type of small town that I grew up in.
         Um, my house was a house that sat on 15 acres of land, and I had, um, my mom and my dad and a three year old, older sister.
         Well at some point my dad decided that, uh, we needed to have goats, so we fenced in our front part of our yard, which was probably about six acres, and we got goats, and on, we also had other animals.
         Like we had a pony and we even actually had a ram at some point but that's another story.
         So we had these goats and they were in a fence, an electric fence, and we would have to cut the hay and bail the hay.
         Well I know I could not have been any older like six or seven years old when we had this pick-up truck that was a straight drive, and, or that's what we called in straight drive and that was a manual shift car or truck.
         And, um, I was really small and that's why I must have only been like six or seven because I couldn't do anything else.
         Um, I couldn't, um, help like bail the hay, pick up the hay, do anything because I was so small, so my mom and my dad and my older sister could, um, help collect the hay so my job became driving the truck and I could reach the pedals.
         I was tall enough to reach the pedals but my dad taught me how and I would get in that truck and drive around from point to point while they picked up the hay and put it in the truck and I'd drive the truck around and wherever it needed to go and they'd store the hay.
         So yeah, I learned how to drive at a very early age and needless to say my first car was a straight drive and no one, um, in that town really waited until they were 15 or 16 to drive.
         We all were driving pretty early because who's going to know about that far out that we didn't have a license so here's related, um, to driving.
         Another thing, uh, that I learned to, how to do very early on was drive a tractor.
         Of course because we had to have a tractor to cut the hay and do all the things that, you know, involved, I guess, in a semi quasi farm we were pretending to have.
         So my dad taught me how to drive this tractor and I thought I was big stuff because you sat up high on the tractor and you could see everything, and, you know, I could just drive it, and drive it, and drive it.
         Well, one Sunday afternoon it was early, no it was after church, um, before dinner was ready.
         I was out there and my dad said I could drive the tractor while we were waiting on dinner.
         So I was driving the tractor around, around, and around, and then I got called in for dinner, so I parked the tractor.
         Oh, our house also sat on a hill and, I think it sat on the top of a hill, and then the field and the fencing went down, and then across the street was my uncle's land and no one lived there.
         Over there it was another field that was fenced in and I don't think there were any animals over there, but it was a fenced in filed as well.
         So I parked this tractor at the top of our driveway, and I go in to eat dinner.
         So we eat and, I don't know, it probably takes about an hour, and I go back out.
         I want to ride the tractor.
         We go back outside for some reason and it wasn't there.
         And I don't have a clue as to what happened to it and I yell for my dad and we go out there and we start looking and we see trail marks all the way down the driveway through our field and then there is the tractor on the other side of the road in the fence.
         So guess what happened, I being the smart little, what, six year old that I was, decided that I forgot or didn't remember correctly that I had put the tractor in park and or in gear and not in neutral.
         I thought for sure, for sure I remembered that my dad said to put it in neutral.
         Yeah, well I remembered wrong so, uh, went over and got the tractor out and my dad drove it back, and I don't know what he did to the fence I'm sure that he fixed it I don't remember how badly it was damaged, but I was so upset I really thought I was big stuff.
         I mean I knew how to drive this tractor and I couldn't believe that I remembered wrong and I made that mistake and I first was scared because I thought I was in trouble but then when I realized I wasn't in trouble I was really, you know, I had lost a lot of confidence because I really thought I was big stuff.
         So I was like, "No more tractor.
         I don't want to have anything more to do with the tractor."
         Well my dad said, "Get back on it your going driving."
         So he made me get back on it because he wanted to teach me that we make mistakes and that you just have to get back on kind a like if you fall off a horse so that's my stories that I remember about driving.
         OK going back to the whole goat thing, I'll tell you another story about the goats.
         Uh the fence, um, we had this goat that we bottle fed, actually we bought, our dad bought the goat.
         Most of our goats were just regular farm goats, but this particular goat was registered.
         He was, you know, high class for a goat.
         He had papers and everything and we named him Remington.
         We named all are animals after TV characters.
         Like all are dogs all the goats were named after TV characters, so Remington was after, uh, I guess that show Remington I forget now but some character.
         Well he was our pet goat and we raised him.
         As a baby, we bottle fed him and we had to burn off his horns because if they grow up with horns then they can be dangerous, so you burn them off when they're little.
         We did that and we played with him basically like he was a dog because he was our little baby.
         He grew up, um, to be a very, um, close animal to us, but because we played with him so much he really thought that he was part of the family and he belonged really wherever we were.
         We'd let him in the house and, you know, take him in the car, take him in the truck, or just do whatever.
         So one day we were, uh, where, we were somewhere in the house, and, like I said, we had this electric fence and the electric fence works only so long until the goats figure out how to get out a of it or decide that they want out, so they'll, you know, endure the few seconds of shock.
         So yeah, Remington got out he didn't think he belonged in the fence anyway with the other goats so he'd gotten out and, uh, we look outside our house and we had a carport and, um, the storm door was open and the screen, and we look out and yeah he's on to a, the car, him standing on top of the car.
         That was when, I think, we decided we needed to set some more boundaries.
         So Remington, um, quickly had to learn some lessons.
         OK I'll tell ya another story about my dad because my dad grew up in basically the same area we did, um real country, and he was the youngest of 11 kids.
         Yeah, um, I'm sure he was an accident, um, and you can tell by his name.
         He kind of got the last of the pick, Homer Stobo.
         Yeah, well, um, well, was like I said, the youngest, so his parents by the time they had him were quite older and I don't think they paid him too much attention or maybe as his older siblings had to, um, have most of the part in his raising or upbringing that I think he was kind a left to do his own thing for quite a while.
         So he was quite rambunctious, so he used to always tell us stories about things he did as a kid.
         First of all, even though he was capable of, uh, going to school and doing his schoolwork, he chose not to and he would always, um, what you call play hooky, and on those days when we wouldn't go to school he would always come up with some kind of tricks, and one of the things I remember him saying that he did and actually since the time this time I had other people confirm that, uh, this is true that he would take a pocketbook, one of his mom's pocketbooks, and empty it out and tie it a string to the handle and he'd put it in the middle of the road and he and his buddy would let the string be long enough to where they could hide in the bushes and still have the string attached and then they'd wait for a car to drive by and there would always be a car to come by because, of course, this was in the country.
         And a car comes by and sees see a pocketbook they think, you know, we're going to pick this up and do one of two things.
         Their going to either take it, which what's more likely is that they're going to look because everybody knows everybody so they pick it up, or they get out of their car and they go to pick it up.
         Of course, as soon as they pick it up my dad and his friend just would jerk that pocketbook.
         Well you would think they'll just jerk it away and laugh.
         Well they decided that that wasn't fun enough so they would jerk it a little bit and make it seem like it was the wind, or just do it a little bit where they weren't, maybe the person wasn't quite sure if it really moved or not, or that maybe they accidentally kicked it and they'd do that a couple a times and then they would have basically be teasing the person along until the person just had thought they were going crazy.
         And then, uh, they finally realized what was going on and my dad and his friend would run and they would just run and run and run.
         And he would do all kinds of little tricks when he was out a school but, um, as it turns out he, um, he was quite into trouble his grades didn't quite make it.
         He made a D in PE, a D in, um, gym.
         Yeah he, he wasn't quite fond of school and he dropped out in May of his senior year, so although he later in life became successful and owned his own company, he just didn't, and I guess, and neither did his parents think school was that important so his, his stories they always told us didn't involve growing up and going to school and doing well and behaving they were always mischievous.
