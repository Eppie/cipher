   
   
      
         OK.
         This is the first interview for 4260 with my step mom Linda Wentz.
      
      
         Hello.
         
      
      
         
         Sorry, um, Linda grew up in a small town in WV called Buckhannon.
         Linda, what did you like
         think about living there?
         What did you think about living there?
         Sorry.
      
      
         Well, I, when I was a little kid I didn't really think a whole lot about it, except that was my home.
         I loved the house that I lived in when I was a little girl, and it was very small, and I lived on a street called Fayette St., and it had a wonderful maple tree in the front and I liked to climb it, I was a tomboy.
         So one of my favorite things do to was, you know, roller-skate and climb trees.
         I had a little, I have three brothers, at the time when I was smaller I only had two because my youngest brother Jimmy hadn't been born yet.
         So my younger brother Jimmy and I, and the next door neighbors would play, and I guess, really Buckhannon was like a very wonderful town to grow up in because there wasn't a lot of crime it was just very safe, a very safe place.
      
      
         How long have you lived in Lincolnton, NC?
      
      
         Nine years.
      
      
         
         OK,
         Um, you're now married to the man that you dated in high school.
         How did you meet him in high school?
      
      
         Well, actually I met him in junior high.
         And I was in the seventh grade and he was in the ninth grade.
         And, um, at lunchtime what we did was we would go to the gym and everybody would eat their lunch in the gym on the bleachers and they would have, they would play records and then the kids would dance.
         Of course, you know, I was very skinny, I was cute but not the kind of girl that guys were looking at, and, I but I used to watch your dad dance with all the other girls and he was a wonderful dancer and I really liked him.
         Used to sit and look at the kids dance and I'd listen to Beetles songs.
         I would look at Larry and I had picked him as the one I'd always wanted to dance with and it wasn't until we got into high school that he noticed me.
         And I was in a
         a talent show with my girlfriend and we did a modern dance to "Pink Panther," and after that my phone didn't stop ringing for awhile.
         And your dad called me and asked me if I wanted to go out with is best friend Tom Rigger, and I said, "Never."
         This guy was not my type and so he said, "Would you like to go out with me?"
         and I said, "Yes, I would," and so that's when we started dating.
      
      
         Why did you like him?
         Besides the fact that he could dance?
      
      
         Well, he was very handsome and I, um, loved his smile, had a beautiful smile.
         And he was, you know, just tall and thin and there was just something about him that I found very, very attractive.
         And he was funny and I liked to laugh.
         Well we just, I really fell kind of madly in love with him,
         at 15.
      
      
         What do you miss most about not living in Buckhannon, WV?
      
      
         Nothing.
         
         As a child I loved it, but as I grew up there just really wasn't a whole lot that Buckhannon had to offer other than the fact that, you know, was where my memories of childhood are and my parents.
         And I like going home to visit my parents and seeing my friends but as far as wanting to live there, I wouldn't.
      
      
         OK, I think y'all have a phone call.
         Let's pause for a moment.RECORDING PAUSED THEN RESUMED
      
      
         OK, we're back.
         What are some funny words that you first heard in NC that you'd never heard before that made you laugh?
      
      
         Well, I guess the first funny world I heard was "Hey!"
         And I couldn't figure out what everyone was talking about.
         You know, they'd say "Hey, how you doing?"
         \\ And you know, we always say-- \\
      
      
         \\ Hay is for horses.
         \\
      
      
         Or "hi" or "hello," and so that, that, this was kind of funny to me.
         Another one of the things that everyone says here, you'll say something to them and they'll say, "Well."
         They say, "well" a lot, it's just a, I don't know what, something that they use to say when they don't know what else to say--
      
      
         It's a hesitation.
      
      
         A hesitation.
         Yeah, well, and, uh, another interesting word was "picking".
         I went right into the school system and I was teaching and, um, it was a little awkward at times and the kids were, they would tease, and instead of saying, you know, I'm teasing, they would say-- \\
      
      
         \\ Hello baby!
         \\
      
      
         They would say, "Mrs. Wentz," and a, you know, another thing they'd make syllables where there isn't even any syllables at all.
         They would, they would make syllables, for instance, my name is Wentz.
         It was, "Mrs. We-ntz, just picking Mrs. We-ntz."
         And "ill" to me that is when you're sick, but people here say, "Well, I was just really ill," which means they were upset or angry or something like that.
      
      
         OK, what about Sundrop?
         Do you like it?
         Does--?
         Is it a drink of your choice?
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Lots of people around here seem to think it is
         it's a, what's it called,
         drink of the gods.
      
      
         Um, well, I, you know, I think it's OK, but it's nothing that I was, that I would want everyday.
         That or Cheery, Cheerwine.
         Those, those are two drinks that I don't crave.
      
      
         OK, Oh, what do you think is, uh,
         best, movie of the century?
         Since it's almost the year 2000.
         
      
      
         
            Oh, um, The Sound of Music.
      
      
         Why?
      
      
         Why?
         Well, I guess I, well I love Julie Andrews, and I like, I really love the music that's in The Sound of Music.
         I like the whole background, the plot.
         And everything.
         And, um, it just makes me feel good.
         In fact, I watched it three times th, this past Christmas, because, I hadn't seen it in awhile, and I loved it so much, that I had to watch it over and over again.
      
      
         OK, um, since we are talking about a movie based in Europe.
         Where are your ancestral roots, Linda?
      
      
         
         Well, my father's family came from Germany.
         My last name is Stonicker.
         And, um,
         one of my grandparents was also from France.
         So there's, there's sort of a mixture there.
         And my mother's family, her last name was Corley.
         And she was, I think.
         -- \\
      
      
         \\ Irish?
         \\
      
      
         Irish, yeah, so I guess it would be kind of a German-Irish mix.
      
      
         Do you miss your dad who lived in Buckhannon, WV?
         And what are some special qualities about him that you can talk about?
      
      
         
         Yeah, I miss my dad.
         I miss my mom.
         But my mom is in heaven.
         My dad is a very, very special man.
         He, um, he grew up in WV and he, um, played football when he was in high school and he went right into the service and he was in WWII, he was a medic in the army.
         And he was over in Europe.
         In fact, I was just talking to him this last Thanksgiving about some of the things that he went through when he was in the service and, and traveling across the sea on these boats that had flat bottoms and they would go way up in the, in the water and then smack down, you know, it was very rough.
         They left out of NY and went to Scotland.
         And, um, he said you would look out if you were up on deck and the waves, the swells were way up higher than, than the boat itself and looked like you were going to drown.
         But the Queen Mary was right beside to them.
         They were in a fleet.
         And the WACs were on the Queen Mary, and, you know, they just had a smooth sailing trip when these poor guys in the army, you know, they were just so sick almost every day because of the, the boats and everything.
         But I, my dad is, um, he's just a very sweet man.
         You know my mother's been gone for four years.
         And he has, he's 81 years old.
         And he takes care of the house wonderfully.
         When we came home for Thanksgiving dinner he had everything prepared, had the turkey in the oven and everything ready.
         He's just a really fine guy.
      
      
         81?
      
      
         He's 81 years old.
         
         He's a retired driller.
         He drilled wells all of his life all over WV, VA, and KY.
      
      
         
         OK.
         That's nice.
         
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         Um, did
         um where, where did you go to college at?
         And why did you want to be an artist?
      
      
         Well, ( ) I wanted to be an artist when I was little girl.
         The first painting that I did that I really remember was a finger painting that I did of one of my dolls.
         And it was just so exciting to me and I was probably only about five years old.
         But I propped my doll up and I had my finger paints and I looked at her and I did this portrait of her and it was just really good to me, I'm sure to anyone else it was like, "Yeah right."
         But I wanted, that was just something that I really enjoyed doing.
         That and dancing.
         I wanted to be a ballerina.
         The ballerina part never came about, but I, I did go on to college and I, um, transferred a lot and ended up going to a lot of different colleges which was kind of fun.
         I went to Marshall University, and I went to University of Pittsburgh, and I ended up graduating from West Virginia University with a major in printmaking and a minor in art history and English literature.
      
      
         Did you ever visit the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh?
         Because that is where he was, he grew up.
         And do, do you enjoy Andy Warhol?
      
      
         Well, you know, that's really funny, but I don't remember visiting the Andy Warhol Museum.
      
      
         Did you know that was where he was from?
      
      
         No.
         But I didn't, I studied Andy Warhol briefly.
         I mean I didn't go an in-depth study of him or that type of art.
      
      
         I think he took his first art lessons at Carnegie Museum-- \\
      
      
         \\ Carnegie Mellon.
         \\
      
      
         \\ Yeah, whatever, Carnegie.
         \\
      
      
         \\ Carnegie Mellon.
         \\
      
      
         When he was a kid and that's how he got interested in art.
      
      
         Um-hmm.
      
      
         But he, I think that his
         parents were Eastern European--
      
      
         Um-hmm.
      
      
         And they were like, lived in the nasty little section where all the mills were and stuff.
         But anyway.
         Um, who's your favorite artist?
      
      
         Well I really liked the Impressionists, I liked Monet and Renoir, Mary Cassatt, I, um, loved studying all of the artists.
         I loved art history.
         I loved Michelangelo's sculptures and his paintings and the Renaissance era.
         
         Rembrandt did the etchings and, you know, that was interesting to me because, you know, that's what I ended up doing, was printmaking.
         But I, I like the light and the pastels, colors that are in the Impressionists.
         
      
      
         What do you think about the current trends in art, modern art?
         Which some conservative people might consider offensive and disturbing?
         Especially the anti-religious art.
      
      
         Um-hmm, well art has always been controversial and has always reflected what is going on in the world.
         You know, and, um, so, you know, having studied art history, that doesn't, it doesn't shock me or surprise me that much.
         And I, you know, I don't like it, personally, because,
         you know, it does offend me, what, what I have seen, and I don't like the idea that we are giving the money to create extremely offensive art, but, um, again, that, that's, you know, is, art reflects what's going on and art is, is very spiritual regardless of whether its content says, you know, something about God or not, there, there has a very spiritual quality about it.
         It's very powerful
      
      
         Um, OK.
         I watched a special on Norman Rockwell the other night on PBS, and some consider him not an artist but just an illustrator.
         What are your comments on that?
      
      
         
         Well, that is a, a statement that I've heard used in art a lot.
         I, personally, I was accused of being an illustrator, which it's interesting that I would even use the word "accuse" because it seems like there is a lot of prejudice in art and of what people say is art with quotation marks around it.
         And, uh, Norman Rockwell was a tremendous artist.
         He was a, he was a, you know, he was a realist.
         And regardless of whether someone calls it illustrative or not.
         It, it is art and it is wonderful art and he has captured a whole era, you know, he captured people and, and people that, who you could look into their faces and you could tell everything about them.
         You know so, people in my field, in my experience, when I was in college, one of the things that I exp, you know, had to deal with, was other people's opinion of what art is, and especially my instructors saying, "You need to be more cryptic," or "You need to be more esoteric, your art is too transparent or too happy."
         You know, well that's me.
      
      
         ( ) All writers have to be suicidal in order to be considered brilliant, I'm so sick of that.
         Why does everyone have kill their selves or be moody, just to be considered a good writer or artist?
      
      
         Well one of the things the art world is looking for is, you know, um, emotion.
         They want an emotion to be evoked, you know, when you look at something.
         Art, art whether it's writing or, or, um, drama or visual or music, you know, there's a term that Shakespeare used.
         It was catharsis, you know, and people want to exper, they want to experience something.
         And I guess even in writing, um,
         , there's so many unhappy people in the world and it seems like, you know, when they read something and can relate to it then they get some kind of release or relief in their emotions by identifying with it and that could be why there seems to be such a demand for that sort of thing.
         And, uh, but, on the other hand, there's the happy people, you know, and I am one of them.
         I'm just a happy person, and my art reflects that, and I think that I, you know, love to read stories that are written and everything that also, you know, have a good moral background to them, and something where you can learn something of value and virtue in it, like Louisa May Alcott, you know, her work, I love her work.
         So, you know, there's two sides to that coin.
         We just have to find the right audience.
      
      
         OK, thank you for your comments, Linda.
         Again, her name's Linda Wentz and she's my step mom who lives a quick 45 minutes away from Charlotte in Lincolnton, NC.
