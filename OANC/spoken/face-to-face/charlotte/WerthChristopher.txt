         This interview is Darlene Maurer interviewing Christopher Werth.
         Chris, can you tell us what stories or book you remember reading as a child?
      
      
         Probably the most, uh, well-known books would be the, uh, uh, a series of books called, uh, Meet, and then it would give a name.
         For example, Meet Andrew Jackson or Meet Daniel Boone or George Washington, uh, things like that.
      
      
         Why were they special?
      
      
         Well I was always interested in biography as a kid, um, so I guess because they told me about things, people, personalities.
         I've always had, had an interest in history, so it was a chance to learn more about people.
      
      
         So it's, uh, it's the history, historical part and learning about the historical people that interested you the most?
      
      
         Probably the biography, you know, the people and the times they lived in.
      
      
         And what age of child, what age of child were you?
      
      
         Umm, I don't know.
         I would probably say sometime between, maybe, uh, five and eight.
      
      
         Wow that young of an age you were interested in other people, huh?
      
      
         Oh yeah.
         I've always been interested.
         It's a, it was a good way to find out what was going on outside the world that I was living in.
      
      
         So do you remember any particular ones that you really liked, or anyone?
      
      
         No.
         I think they were just all interesting books, uh, you know, I had a whole collection them and I only got rid of them when I was in high school.
         Now I hear they're pretty valuable books.
         
         As usually the case.
      
      
         Yeah.
         That happens, yes.
      
      
         But, um, you know, they were interesting and they talked about the, not just the famous persons, but they also talked about, um, you know, the times they lived in and things like that.
         Pretty nicely illustrated,-
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         OK.
         \\ Did you have-\\
      
      
         \\ -easy to read.
         \\.
      
      
         -special feelings when you read them, or-?
      
      
         Just tried to imagine what life was like in those times.
      
      
         Oh I see, so you would like-
      
      
         
            
         
      
      
         -go into the imagination, go into the imagination of-
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         -this is what it must have been like being this person or living at that time or-
      
      
         Yeah, or knowing some things.
      
      
         -something like that?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         So, OK.
         Um, anything else you can remember about that?
      
      
         No.
         Just, just generally.
      
      
         OK.
         So where, uh, was this?
         Was this-?
      
      
         Um, between, well home was NJ and Raleigh.
         New Jersey and Raleigh, NC.
      
      
         OK.
         
         So, um
         , anything else you can think of for us?
      
      
         No.
         I just think they were just fairly well-illustrated, you know.
         Simple to read compared to some of the other stuff I was reading.
         But they were pretty simple to read.
      
      
         Oh, OK.
         Can you remember some, uh, any other stories that you might have read or stories your family, someone maybe in your family, told you?
      
      
         Um-
         
            
         
      
      
         Hi.
      
      
         Hi
         .
         Do you need the room?
      
      
         Yeah.BREAK
      
      
         Can you think of any stories that, um, that you remember from growing up or anyone in the family telling you?
         Anyone in your family telling stories?
      
      
         The only story I might remember would be, um, as I got older, um, you know, asking folks what it was like, uh, living in France during the Nazi occupation, what it was like growing up before that, and that type of thing.
      
      
         So your parents came over here?
      
      
         My father did in `16.
      
      
         OK.
      
      
         After the Second World War.
      
      
         Your mom was born here then?
      
      
         My mom was born here.
         So maybe asking her what it was like growing up in New York City before WW II or during the War, or that type of thing.
      
      
         Oh, I see.
      
      
         But as rule, storytelling was not something that I grew up with like some traditions and some cultures and some places there were-
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         -you tell stories about things, you have to ask for those, that information.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         Maybe because the memories were so pitifully painful.
      
      
         Right.
         Was it difficult?
         Do they, do they, uh, share about what their homeland was like?
         What France was like?
      
      
         Dad doesn't talk too much about what life was like, other than talking about how good times were before the War.
         But during the War he doesn't, he's got, a lot of stuff has been blocked out.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         Because I imagine that life was pretty tough.
         Mom remembers a lot of stuff, but, uh, you know, details of everyday life, but, uh, she also remembers a lot about the Great Depression and then the rationing during the Second World War and things like that, but she doesn't go into much detail either.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         It must of have been pretty hard.
         That's all I can think-
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         -since it wasn't talked about.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Or still isn't talked about unless you pry it out of them.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         And even then you don't get a full story.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         Do they ever talk about good memories they had back then?
      
      
         Uh, they have some good memories but it's just not talked about, period.
      
      
         Um.
      
      
         Just, I, I didn't not grow up in a tradition where storytelling about life, you know, or heroics, uh, were talked about, or it just, you have to pry people's information, I guess, pull from their information.
      
      
         Um, just don't go there, huh?
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         Yeah, yeah, I understand.
      
      
         I know some people freely talked about their, about exploits, you know.
         That's just, that's just not part of the family tradition, I guess.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
         OK.
         Um, OK, all right.
         Is there anything else you'd like to say?
      
      
         No.
         Um, just that, um, you know, that as far as, you know, stories, you know, most of the stories I, you know, if I remember anything it's about the books I read and stuff.
         But oral storytelling is not part of, you know, as I say, the family tradition.
      
      
         Your family didn't talk much around the dinner table about stories?
      
      
         Well we talked about what happened during your day and, you know, what happened at school, what happened at work, but as a rule, um, and maybe that's because, for, you know, from the time I was 10, um, you know, I didn't have any cousins living nearby, and aunts and uncles, and grandparents.
      
      
         Oh, OK.
      
      
         So-
      
      
         So that really made a difference?
      
      
         Yeah.
         My mother's parents were both dead by that time, well before I was born, and so I never knew my mother's parents and there would have been stories, maybe, there.
      
      
         Right.
      
      
         Uh, when I was 10, I moved away from my grandfather, who already, uh, I think he was already dead by that time, and my grandmother was definitely, you know, way away and we didn't talk to her.
         Un, o, my father may have talked to her once a week on the phone.
      
      
         Where did she live?
      
      
         In NY, but we were in NC by this time so-
      
      
         OK, OK.
      
      
         So maybe, you know, it was just, you know, you know, when I would physically see her for a while, it was like once a year.
         But there was never any storytelling going on.
      
      
         Uh-huh.
      
      
         Until she got maybe much older, and then I started prying into the family history.
      
      
         Yeah.
      
      
         But that was only because I was doing a research project in which you talk about things.
      
      
         OK.
         So do you have brothers and sisters?
      
      
         I have one brother, younger.
      
      
         Uh-huh OK.
      
      
         No sisters.
      
      
         OK, good.
         Well, thank you for sharing your story with us.
      
      
         All right, thank you.
         Good luck on your project.
      
      
         Thanks.
